Then, he signed a peace treaty with Germany to end Russia's part in World War I, which was like, so not fetch.\n\nBut the drama didn't stop there.

The two most prevalent languages are English and Spanish, followed by other languages like Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and French.\n\nSimilarities:\n1. Shared Influence: English, Spanish, and French have Latin roots, influencing their vocabulary and grammar.\n2. Borrowed Words: English has borrowed words from Spanish, French, and other languages, reflecting the country's multiculturalism.\n3. Language Evolution: All languages spoken in the U.S. have evolved over time, influenced by social, cultural, and technological changes.\n\nDifferences:\n1. Prevalence: English is the dominant language, spoken by approximately 78% of the population. Spanish is the second most common language, spoken by about 13.5% of the population. Other languages like Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and French are spoken by smaller percentages.\n2. Geographic Concentration: Spanish is predominantly spoken in the Southwest, Florida, and major cities like New York and Chicago. Chinese languages are more common in major urban areas, while French is more prevalent in Louisiana and New England.\n3. Writing Systems: English uses the Latin alphabet, as does Spanish. However, Chinese uses logographic writing system, which is significantly different.\n\nConclusion:\nThe linguistic landscape of the United States is diverse and dynamic, reflecting the country's rich cultural heritage and history of immigration.
