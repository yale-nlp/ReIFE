We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\nHer visa to stay here is coming to an end later this year, then she will be forced to return to Malaysia despite opting to stay here if she had the choice. We have gone down the job route, to the point that she was offered the job here, but the employer failed to get a license to issue Visas on very petty grounds.\nI (and others) have suggested getting married. It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nWhy does eating something crunchy sound so loud and overpower other sounds?\n\n# Output (b):\nThe noise that crunchy foods make when we eat them can reach 63 decibels. Humans love crunchy, noisy snacks, and the noise can help us identify what we are eating. The noise draws attention to the mouth and makes us concentrate on what we are eating. This can also influence how much we consume.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe sound is transmitted through the vibrations of your jawbone and skull directly to your inner ear, so it can seem much louder than most other sounds.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output explain the reason why eating something crunchy sounds so loud and overpowers other sounds with sufficient accuracy and precision? \n 2. Does the output accurately describe the relationship between the texture of food and the loudness of its sound when eaten? \n 3. Does the output include any unnecessary or extraneous information that is not relevant to the instruction or the answer to the question?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, here's why eating something crunchy sounds so loud and overpowers other sounds: \n\n **Crunchy Foods Create High-Frequency Sounds:** \n - When you crunch a food, the force of the bite generates high-frequency sounds that travel through the air. These sounds are beyond the range of hearing for most humans, but they can be easily detected by our sensitive hearing mechanisms. \n\n **Mouth Mechanics:** \n - The act of chewing and swallowing also creates low-frequency sounds due to the vibrations of your jaw and mouth. These sounds are not as high-pitched as the crunchy sounds, but they can still be noticeable. \n\n **Amplified Sounds:** \n - The resonating cavity of your mouth amplifies the sounds of eating crunchy foods. The hard palate and the resonating chamber of the mouth act as a natural amplifier, making the crunchy sounds seem louder. \n\n **Attention to Sounds:** \n - When you eat something crunchy, your attention is often focused on the sound of the crunch. This increased attention to sound makes the crunchy sounds seem more prominent. \n\n **Other Factors:** \n - The texture and composition of the food can also affect the sound it makes when eaten. For example, foods with a lot of air pockets, such as popcorn or crackers, tend to make a more popping sound. Foods that are hard and crunchy, such as nuts or seeds, make a more grinding sound. \n\n **Conclusion:** \n The combination of high-frequency sounds, amplified sounds, and your increased attention to sounds when eating crunchy foods all contribute to the perception of the sound as being so loud and overpowering other sounds.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

I'm all for texting with people about small stuff, but having a conversation via text is difficult. It's impossible to say everything you want to say without writing an essay and there is tons of room for miscommunication. I find that the conversation are very superficial when texting.

He says he hates talk on the phone and when I call him, he has nothing to say and sounds bored. I offered to video chat or something, but he doesn't want to try. \nWe don't see each other often, so we end up going long periods of time without seeing or hearing each other, only texting. I feel no connection when we text. He sees no problem with this. Am I wrong to be annoyed?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend only likes to text me for shallow conversation. I want deeper and intellectually stimulating conversations. Am I wrong to be annoyed?\n\n# Output (a):\nBoyfriend only likes to talk through text. He sees no issue with it.

You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately and completely summarize the content of the text, including the challenges and frustrations associated with texting with the boyfriend and the desire for deeper and intellectually stimulating conversations? \n 2. Does the output maintain the tone and style of the text, which is conversational and personal, while also being concise and to the point? \n 3. Does the output provide a clear and direct answer to the question of whether the writer is wrong to be annoyed by the lack of connection and depth in their text conversations with their boyfriend?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, here is a summary of the content in a concise way: \n\n The user is concerned about their boyfriend's lack of engagement in conversation through text. They find that texting is difficult to express themselves fully and often leads to superficial talk. They crave deeper and intellectually stimulating conversations. However, their boyfriend refuses to engage in talk on the phone or video chat. The user feels disconnected and unfulfilled when they text, but he sees no problem with it.

The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately reflect the possibility of life on a planet without the necessary resources for space flight, considering the advanced technological level of the civilization and their ability to build large telescopes? \n 2. Does the output provide sufficient information about the chemical abilities of the civilization and whether they would be sufficient to create the necessary chemicals for space flight? \n 3. Does the output provide a clear and concise explanation of the feasibility of the scenario and the potential challenges that the civilization might face in achieving space flight?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n## Feasible or Far-fetched? \n\n **Feasible:** \n\n While the exact resources required for spaceflight are complex and depend on the specific technology used, some elements are essential. These include: \n\n * **Hydrogen:** A readily available fuel for rockets due to its high hydrogen content and low mass. \n * **Oxygen:** Necessary for combustion in rockets and sustaining life. \n * **Lithium:** A powerful battery material for energy storage. \n * **Cryogenic materials:** For supercooling fuel and structural components. \n\n **Considering your scenario:** \n\n If a civilization has advanced enough to build large telescopes, they likely have the technological prowess to extract and refine these essential resources. The energy required for such advanced telescope construction would be substantial, potentially leading to the development of energy storage technologies that could be adapted for rocket fuel production. \n\n **Challenges:** \n\n However, there are challenges to consider: \n\n * **Resource availability:** The distribution of resources like hydrogen and oxygen on a planet is not uniform. Finding the right concentrations in large enough quantities could be difficult. \n * **Energy expenditure:** Building and operating large telescopes and rockets require significant energy input. The civilization would need a stable energy source to sustain their activities. \n * **Material limitations:** The materials needed for building rockets and other spaceflight technology might be scarce on the planet. \n\n **Overall:** \n\n While the lack of resources for spaceflight might seem like a significant obstacle, it's not insurmountable for a highly advanced civilization. With enough ingenuity and resourcefulness, they could overcome these challenges and achieve their goals. \n\n **For your sci-fi story:** \n\n This premise has the potential for a compelling story. You could explore the challenges faced by the civilization in finding and utilizing the necessary resources. Additionally, you could create a unique solution to their predicament, leading to a unique and intriguing spacefaring society.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her? Again, sorry for my bad english =/\n\n# Output (b):\nI want to give some advice to my 17-year-old sister to avoid risky situations while drunk, without instilling rape fear or guilt in her.

Focus on the immediate danger:** \n\n * Begin by acknowledging the situation and expressing concern about your sister's safety. \n * Highlight the risk of drowning while drunk and the potential consequences. \n * Avoid dwelling on the negative aspects of the situation or making assumptions about her behavior. \n\n **2. Address the underlying issue:** \n\n * Mention the issue of consent and the harmful culture surrounding it. \n * Explain that victims often feel guilt and blame themselves, and that this is not fair or accurate. \n * Emphasize that you want to empower your sister and not contribute to the problem. \n\n **3. Offer guidance and support:** \n\n * Be clear and direct about your concerns and expectations. \n * Don't preach or lecture, but offer your advice and guidance as a concerned older brother. \n * Let her know that you're there to support her and that you'll always have her back. \n\n **Here's an example of how you could phrase your advice:** \n\n \"I know things have been a bit rough lately, and I wanted to talk to you about it. I'm concerned about the situation with you and your friends at the beach recently. It sounds like things got a bit out of hand with the drinking and the bath. I understand that you might not like me saying this, but I have to be honest - the risk of drowning while drunk is very real, and I wouldn't want you to put yourself in that position. \n\n Also, I've been reading a lot about feminist issues lately, and it's made me think about the way women are often blamed for their own victimization. I don't want you to feel that way, and I definitely don't want to be a part of that culture. It's important to remember that no one deserves to be raped. You should never feel guilty or ashamed for being a victim. \n\n I know this is a sensitive topic, and I appreciate you listening to me. I'm always here to talk if you need me.

It is often evident as facts, numbers, or statistics and is used to convince an audience of an argument.\n\n# Output (a):\nEthos is the ethical appeal, which is used to convince an audience of the author's credibility or character. Pathos is the emotional appeal, which is used to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions. Logos is the appeal to logic and is used to convince an audience by the use of logic and reason.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately and completely explain the concepts of Pathos, Ethos, and Logos as they apply to the given instruction? \n 2. Does the output provide the necessary information and details to understand the concepts of Pathos, Ethos, and Logos as they apply to the given instruction? \n 3. Does the output clearly and concisely explain the concepts of Pathos, Ethos, and Logos as they apply to the given instruction, without going beyond or below the requirements of the instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n**Pathos, Ethos, Logos** \n\n **Pathos** (pathos) appeals to emotion. It uses vivid imagery, personal anecdotes, and emotional language to evoke feelings in the audience. \n\n **Ethos** (ethos) appeals to authority and credibility. It references the speaker's expertise, experience, and reputation to build trust and confidence in the audience. \n\n **Logos** (logos) appeals to reason and logic. It uses facts, statistics, evidence, and clear reasoning to convince the audience of the speaker's viewpoint. \n\n **Key Differences:** \n\n * **Pathos** focuses on emotions, while **ethos** emphasizes credibility and **logos** relies on logic. \n * **Pathos** uses emotional language and imagery, while **ethos** uses authority and **logos** uses facts and evidence. \n * **Pathos** appeals to feelings, while **ethos** appeals to reason and **logos** appeals to logic.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nSome people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus stop, half of the people got down and 4 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal? \n\n# Output (b):\nLet's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. \n\nAt the first stop, half of the people got down, so there were x/2 people left on the bus. Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately reflect the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, taking into account the number of people who got off and the number of people who got on at each bus stop? \n 2. Does the output precisely match the number of people heading to the third stop as specified in the instruction? \n 3. Does the output contain any unnecessary information or omit any necessary information related to the instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, here is the solution: \n\n - Half of the people (12 people) got down at the first bus stop. \n - 4 people got in at the first bus stop. \n - So, there are 12 + 4 = 16 people remaining on the bus. \n - 6 people got down at the second bus stop. \n - 8 people got in at the second bus stop. \n - So, there are 16 - 6 + 8 = 18 people remaining on the bus. \n - There are a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, so the number of people that got on the bus at the terminal is 18. \n\n Therefore, the answer is 18.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here? I don't really know anything about finance, or what's actually going on. I really want to help my parents, but at the same time I have to protect myself too.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy mom asked me to hide her \u20ac12,000 savings from the bank so that the bank doesn't know about it. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Output (a):\nI'm a student in Ireland. I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately and precisely summarize the content of the text, including the key points of the student's situation and their concerns? \n 2.

My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nI don't want to be an engineer, I like physics. Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster. Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. **Does the output provide a clear and direct answer to the question of whether it is possible to continue pursuing physics while doing engineering (IT)?** \n 2. **Does the output provide any suggestions or advice on how to balance the pursuit of physics with engineering studies, or how to address the family's concerns?** \n 3. **Does the output provide any information about potential career opportunities in physics related fields while pursuing engineering (IT)?**\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n**Response:** \n\n **1. Pursue Engineering with a Focus on Physics:** \n\n * Engineering and physics are closely related fields, and you can certainly continue your passion for physics while pursuing engineering (IT). Many engineers specialize in areas that involve physics, such as electrical engineering, civil engineering, or mechanical engineering. \n * You can incorporate your physics interests into your engineering studies by taking elective courses in areas like materials science, fluid dynamics, or electromagnetism. \n * Consider specializing in a sub-discipline of engineering that aligns with your physics interests, such as aerospace engineering, nuclear engineering, or environmental engineering. \n\n **2. Explore Alternative Options:** \n\n * If you're feeling overwhelmed by engineering or want to pursue a more research-oriented path, consider alternative options within physics. For example, you could pursue a master's degree in physics or consider research positions in academia or industry. \n * Look for scholarships and grants that are available to students pursuing physics. There are many organizations that offer financial assistance to students who demonstrate exceptional talent and potential. \n\n **3. Communicate with Your Parents:** \n\n * It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your parents about your aspirations. Express your concerns and listen to their perspective. \n * Be prepared to explain your reasons for choosing physics over engineering and highlight your goals and ambitions. \n * Be patient and understanding, and work together to find a compromise that meets your needs and their expectations. \n\n **Conclusion:** \n\n While engineering may not be your ultimate passion, you can certainly continue your love for physics while pursuing a career in the field. With careful planning and a willingness to explore alternative options, you can find a path that allows you to excel in your studies and pursue your interests.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nHow do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity? \n\n# Output (b):\nVaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of a virus or bacteria, or parts of its structure such as proteins, into a person's body. The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately and comprehensively explain the mechanism of vaccinations in protecting individuals and communities from infectious diseases? \n 2. Does the output provide sufficient information about the concept of herd immunity and its relationship to vaccination? \n 3. Does the output include any unnecessary or irrelevant information that deviates from the requirements of the instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n**How Vaccinations Work:** \n\n Vaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of a virus or bacteria into the body. This allows the immune system to develop antibodies against the pathogen without causing illness. \n\n **Types of Vaccinations:** \n\n * **Live vaccines:** Contain a weakened form of the virus or bacteria. \n * **Inactivated vaccines:** Contain a killed form of the virus or bacteria. \n * **Subunit vaccines:** Target specific parts of the virus or bacteria. \n * **Toxoid vaccines:** Target toxins produced by the bacteria. \n\n **Herd Immunity:** \n\n Herd immunity refers to the indirect protection afforded to unvaccinated individuals when a large majority of the population is vaccinated. When a high percentage of people are immunized, it creates a barrier against the spread of infection. \n\n **How Herd Immunity Protects Communities:** \n\n * **Reduced transmission:** When a high percentage of people are vaccinated, the number of infected individuals decreases, reducing the risk of transmission to unvaccinated individuals. \n * **Protection of vulnerable populations:** Vaccinations protect individuals who cannot be vaccinated due to medical conditions or age. \n * **Prevention of outbreaks:** Herd immunity helps prevent outbreaks by limiting the spread of infection. \n\n **Example:** \n\n Measles is a highly contagious virus that can cause serious illness. In the United States, measles was eliminated in 2000 due to widespread vaccination. However, outbreaks have occurred in areas with low vaccination rates. \n\n **Conclusion:** \n\n Vaccinations are an effective way to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases. Herd immunity is a crucial concept that highlights the importance of vaccination for the overall health of society. By vaccinating a high percentage of the population, we can create a barrier against the spread of infection and protect vulnerable individuals.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.", "instruction": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

The show's DJ was very inviting, but only for one person. He played a duet with a few other people. It ended up being good.\n\n# Output (a):\nWe left the fridge to get to make him think he would not. He laughed when he said he might buy a pizza. We went to the right nearby place. He had won the contest and enjoyed dinner.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately capture the key elements of the instruction, including the first sentence and the requirement for a brief story? \n 2. Does the output contain the necessary details and information to complete the instruction effectively, as requested in the requirements? \n 3. Does the output maintain a consistent and logical flow with the provided first sentence and the requirement for a brief story?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nWe went to a dinner and show one night. The restaurant was a cozy Italian place with a lively atmosphere. The food was delicious, and the performance was a captivating dance troupe.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

We have been in a relationship for 2 years and have been best friends for 2 before that. He loves always having plans and hanging out with people, which I also sometimes enjoy doing but I also need nights where we can just stay in and watch movies or do nothing. Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns. How do I get him to see my point of view?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend is an extrovert and loves to hang out with friends, I am an introvert and need nights alone to relax. He doesn't understand my need for a night in, and it puts me under stress. How do I get him to understand?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy boyfriend and I are always busy and I need a night in. He thinks I'm being lazy and doesn't understand why I need a night in.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Does the output maintain the balance between the requested content and any additional information or opinions included in the text? \n 3.

This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends.

The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training. Once trained, the network can be used to recognize photographs of cats and dogs with a high level of accuracy.\n\n# Output (a):\nSure! Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately identify the key features of cat and dog photographs that allow for their distinction? \n 2. Does the output contain the necessary components to build a neural network for recognizing cat and dog photographs as specified in the instruction? \n 3. Does the output provide a clear and concise implementation of the instruction, ensuring that all requirements are met and the process is easily understood?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n**Neural Network for Cat and Dog Photo Recognition** \n\n **Architecture:** \n\n The neural network consists of multiple layers, including: \n\n **1. Input Layer:** \n - Accepts a 224x224 pixel image as input. \n\n **2.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nExplain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\n# Output (b):\nSelf-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nWhat is the purpose of the `key` argument in the Python sorted() function and what should I pass as inputs?\n\n# Output (b):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to specify a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the input iterable. The items are then sorted based on the values returned by this function.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to define a key for sorting. It is used to tell the function how to compare two strings to determine which one should be placed before the other in the sorted output.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately reflect the purpose of the `key` argument in the `sorted()` function as stated in the instruction? \n 2. Does the output contain the necessary elements as requested in the instruction, or does it contain more or less than what is required? \n 3.

If not specified, the elements are sorted based on their natural order. \n * The `reverse` parameter can be used to specify whether the elements should be sorted in ascending or descending order. \n * The `key` argument is particularly useful when you want to sort elements based on a different criteria than their natural order.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nDescribe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.\n\n# Output (b):\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately and completely describe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English, as requested in the instruction? \n 2. Does the output contain any information that is not requested in the instruction, or does it omit any necessary information? \n 3. Does the output provide a clear and concise example to illustrate the differences between Shakespearean and modern English?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n**Shakespearean English** \n\n * **Formal and ornate:** Uses complex vocabulary and syntax, often with a poetic or dramatic tone. \n * **Unclear and ambiguous:** Can be difficult to understand for modern readers due to outdated language and syntax. \n * **Metaphors and imagery:** Rich use of metaphors and imagery to create vivid and imaginative worlds. \n * **Historical context:** Reflects the language and culture of Elizabethan England. \n\n **Modern English** \n\n * **Concise and direct:** Uses simpler vocabulary and syntax, often with a more conversational tone. \n * **Clear and accessible:** Easy to understand for most modern readers. \n * **Direct and literal:** Strays less from the literal meaning of words and sentences. \n * **Modern usage:** Reflects the language and culture of the modern era. \n\n **Example:** \n\n **Shakespearean:** \n\n \"The course of true love never did run smooth, but it is a journey worth taking.\" \n\n **Modern:** \n\n \"Love is not always easy, but it's a worthwhile experience.\"\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.", "output_2": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there?

Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nTell the story of the Russian Revolution, in the way of a sarcastic mean girl. Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Does the output contain the necessary elements to tell the story of the Russian Revolution as requested in the instruction, without exceeding or falling short of the requirements? \n 3. Does the output maintain the tone of sarcasm and meanness as requested in the instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, here's the story of the Russian Revolution in a nutshell, delivered with a side of snark: \n\n \"So, you want to know about the Russian Revolution, huh? Buckle up, because I'm about to drop knowledge on you so fast your head will spin like a Bolshevik's hair in a windstorm. \n\n It all started with a bunch of pissed-off peasants and a government that was more concerned with lining its pockets than with feeding its people. You know, the usual stuff. \n\n But the real game began with the Bolsheviks, a bunch of idealistic dreamers who believed in a world where everyone was equal. They were like the hippies of the proletariat, except with less flower power and more guns. \n\n The Bolsheviks started throwing their weight around, overthrowing the government and setting up their own red-tinted paradise. It was a real mess, with lots of blood and a lot of fighting. \n\n But the revolution didn't stop there. It spread like a wildfire across the country, engulfing everything in its fiery path. The Tsar was overthrown, the Czars were deposed, and the world was forever changed. \n\n So, the next time you're complaining about your day, just be grateful you weren't living in Russia during the revolution.

was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.", "output_2": "Oh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?", "instruction": "Tell the story of the Russian Revolution, in the way of a sarcastic mean girl.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit? The school might not see the problem with their actions, but their insurance might. Maybe submitting a claim would get their attention?\n\n# Output (a):\nThese people can\u2019t be trusted whatsoever, you should make a scene at his school to show people the consequences of their ill behavior.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately and precisely reflect the instruction to provide the best advice on the situation described, taking into account the specific details and context provided in the text? \n\n\n 2. Does the output contain the necessary information and resources to effectively address the issue of the child's peanut allergy and ensure his safety? \n\n\n 3. Does the output clearly and concisely explain the potential risks and consequences of not following the instructions and the importance of vigilance in managing the child's allergy?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n##  Best Advice \n\n **1. Document Everything:** \n - Keep a record of all incidents, including the date, time, what happened, and any witnesses. \n - Document all communication with the school, including emails, phone calls, and meetings. \n - This will be helpful if you need to escalate the issue to the school board. \n\n **2. Be Proactive:** \n - Talk to your son regularly about his allergy and the importance of asking about nuts. \n - Practice scenarios with him where he might be offered peanuts and how to handle the situation. \n - Make sure he knows the signs of an allergic reaction and what to do in an emergency. \n\n **3. Request a Meeting with the Principal and Teacher:** \n - Request a meeting with the principal and teacher to discuss the issue further. \n - Express your concerns and ask for specific procedures to be put in place to ensure your son's safety. \n - This could include designated nut-free zones in the cafeteria, training for staff on allergy management, and a system for tracking and managing allergies. \n\n **4. Set Boundaries and Expectations:** \n - Set clear boundaries with the school and make it clear that you will not tolerate any incidents involving your son's allergy. \n - If he is given peanuts or has an allergic reaction at school, you will need to take further action, such as filing a complaint with the school board or seeking legal counsel. \n\n **5. Advocate for Change:** \n - If the school is not taking your concerns seriously, it's time to take action. \n - Contact the school board and local media to raise awareness about the issue. \n - You can also start a petition or write letters to the school board members. \n\n **Additional Resources:** \n\n - **Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Connection Team (FAACT):** faact.org \n - **American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI):** allergy.org \n - **Indiana Department of Education:** education.in.gov/special-needs/ \n\n **It's important to remember that you are not alone in this.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.", "winner": 2}, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 1}

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nCompare and contrast the languages spoken in the United States, following the common requirements of writing a compare-and-contrast essay\n\n# Output (b):\nThe United States is a linguistically diverse country with over 350 languages spoken. The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately and completely compare and contrast the languages spoken in the United States as requested in the instruction? \n 2. Does the output contain the necessary elements of a compare-and-contrast essay as requested in the requirements? \n 3. Does the output maintain a clear and organized structure, making it easy to follow the flow of thought and compare the languages effectively?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n## Languages Spoken in the United States: A Comparison \n\n The United States of America, a nation built by immigrants from various backgrounds, boasts a diverse linguistic landscape. While English reigns supreme as the official language, other languages hold significant sway within the country's vibrant tapestry of communication. \n\n English, a West Germanic language, arrived in the colonies with the English settlers and quickly became the dominant language. Its widespread adoption was facilitated by its association with political power and economic prosperity. Today, English is spoken by the majority of Americans, albeit with regional variations in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. \n\n Spanish, the second most spoken language in the U.S., arrived with Mexican immigrants in the late 19th century. It is primarily spoken in the Southwest and South, particularly in states like California, Texas, and Arizona. Spanish is a Romance language, sharing similarities with Italian, French, and Portuguese. Its influence is evident in the culinary landscape, music, and even the language of government officials in certain states. \n\n Chinese, the third most spoken language, is predominantly spoken by Chinese immigrants in the West Coast cities of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York. It is a Sino-Tibetan language, vastly different from English in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and writing system. The presence of Chinese communities has significantly influenced the cultural landscape, with Chinese restaurants, businesses, and even local government institutions catering to their linguistic needs. \n\n Other notable languages spoken in the U.S. include Hindi, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Arabic. These languages are primarily spoken by immigrants from their respective countries of origin, forming vibrant communities across various cities. \n\n In conclusion, the languages spoken in the United States reflect the nation's diverse cultural heritage and its position as a global melting pot. While English remains the dominant language, other languages like Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Vietnamese hold significant ground, shaping the nation's linguistic tapestry and enriching its cultural landscape.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nDo you know of anyone who was unable to become an engineer despite getting the degree and their best efforts? Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately reflect the intent of the instruction to provide advice on the situation described, with a focus on the applicant's struggle to become an engineer despite having the degree and their best efforts? \n\n\n 2. Does the output provide a balanced and realistic assessment of the applicant's situation, taking into account their limited experience, the competitive nature of the industry, and the time constraints they are facing? \n\n\n 3. Does the output offer practical and actionable suggestions for the applicant to improve their chances of securing an engineering position, such as exploring alternative job options or seeking additional experience through extracurricular activities or volunteer work?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n**Response:** \n\n **1. Reassess your job search strategy:** \n\n * Broaden your search beyond Western PA and consider locations that offer more opportunities in engineering. \n * Network with engineers in your target industries to expand your connections and gain insights into the job market. \n * Refine your resume and cover letter to highlight your engineering skills and passion. \n\n **2. Consider alternative options:** \n\n * Explore positions like tech/CAD operator as a stepping stone to gain experience and build your network. \n * Look for engineering-related roles, such as project manager or data analyst, that may require less experience. \n * Consider freelance engineering work or consulting to gain experience and build your portfolio. \n\n **3. Stay positive and persistent:** \n\n * Don't let setbacks discourage you. Engineering is a competitive field, and it takes time to land a job. \n * Stay focused on your goal and keep applying for positions that align with your aspirations. \n * Seek support from friends, family, or a career counselor if needed. \n\n **4. Time management:** \n\n * Create a schedule that allows you to dedicate time to your job search and other activities. \n * Set realistic goals and track your progress to stay motivated. \n * Use your time wisely by focusing on tasks that will have the greatest impact on your job search. \n\n **5. Seek professional advice:** \n\n * If you're feeling overwhelmed or stuck in a rut, consider consulting with a career counselor or coach. \n * They can provide guidance and help you develop strategies to improve your job search and overcome challenges. \n\n **Additional tips:** \n\n * Stay up-to-date with industry trends and technologies to demonstrate your knowledge and adaptability. \n * Be open to new opportunities and be willing to pivot your search if necessary. \n * Don't be afraid to ask for referrals or recommendations from people in your network. \n * Stay positive and persistent, and don't let setbacks discourage you.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nDesign a poster encouraging people to save electricity. Describe the background image, text positions, text contents, etc.\n\n# Output (b):\nSave Energy: Unplug unwanted electronics. Use energy-saving bulbs. Use natural light whenever possible. Turn off electronics and appliances when not in use. Turn down the thermostat a few degrees. The poster aims to quickly convey the message that individual actions to save electricity today contribute to a brighter and sustainable future for everyone. The split image visually contrasts the choices we make now with the positive outcomes we can achieve. Remember, a successful poster communicates the message clearly and concisely while capturing the viewer's attention. The \"Brighten Tomorrow, Conserve Today\" concept emphasizes the urgency and rewards of energy conservation in a visually impactful way.\n\n# Output (a):\nPoster: Save Electricity, Illuminate Tomorrow**\n\n**Background Image:**\nThe background image depicts a serene and beautiful planet Earth seen from space, with a bright, radiant sun on one side symbolizing energy.

Be a Watt-saver.\"\n\n4. **Tips for Saving Electricity:** Aligned horizontally across the bottom of the poster, each tip bulleted:\n   - \"Switch off lights when not in use.\"\n   - \"Unplug chargers to prevent energy wastage.\"\n   - \"Use energy-efficient appliances.\"\n   - \"Opt for natural light during the day.\"\n\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately and completely fulfill the requirements of the instruction in terms of the design and content of the poster? \n 2. Does the output contain the necessary elements and information requested in the instruction, without exceeding or falling short of the requirements? \n 3.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

The more air you put in, the bigger it gets. Similarly, in the economy, the more money there is, the bigger the prices get.\n\n# Output (a):\nInflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. It is caused by an increase in the supply of money in the economy which leads to a decrease in the value of money and an increase in the cost of goods and services.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1.

One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately reflect the intent of the instruction to address the problem of alignment on priorities and its impact on workflow bottlenecks across departments? \n 2. Does the output propose solutions that are aligned with the requirements of the instruction and are creative and effective in resolving the problem? \n 3. Does the output emphasize the potential benefits of implementing the proposed solutions in terms of increased development speed and improved company competitiveness?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n**Organizational Change:** \n\n **1. Establish a Cross-Functional Prioritization Committee:** \n - Create a committee comprising representatives from each department. \n - Set clear criteria for prioritizing projects based on business value, impact, and dependencies. \n - Establish a shared prioritization framework and decision-making process. \n\n **2. Implement a Kanban System:** \n - Implement a Kanban board to visualize work flow and identify bottlenecks. \n - Use Kanban principles to limit work-in-progress and expedite task completion. \n\n **3. Create Cross-Functional Teams:** \n - Form cross-functional teams for complex projects, with members from different departments. \n - Foster collaboration and alignment through regular meetings and shared decision-making. \n\n **4. Use Project Management Tools:** \n - Utilize project management tools to track progress, dependencies, and resource allocation. \n - Ensure that all team members have access to the same information and can collaborate effectively. \n\n **5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nAnalyze this sentence:\n\u201cShe didn't shop because she was too tired.\u201d\n\n# Output (b):\nThis sentence is an example of an excuse. It suggests that someone did not do something because they were too tired, when in fact there may be other reasons why they did not shop. It could be interpreted as someone trying to avoid responsibility or justify their actions.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe sentence means that the person decided not to shop because they lacked the energy to do so. This shows that the person is either too busy or too exhausted to shop, indicating that they may be busy with other activities or just might not have the energy to shop. This sentence also reveals the person's lack of interest in shopping, which could be due to financial or time constraints.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately reflect the sentiment of the sentence (\"She didn't shop because she was too tired\") and the reason for her non-shopping? \n 2. Does the output include all the necessary information and details requested in the instruction (e.g., the subject, the reason for non-shopping)? \n 3. Does the output avoid including unnecessary information or details that are not requested in the instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n**Analysis:** \n\n The sentence is: \"She didn't shop because she was too tired.\" \n\n **Conciseness:** \n\n The sentence is concise as it uses few words to convey the information. The use of the phrase \"because\" and the conjunction \"too\" helps to reduce the number of words. \n\n **Conciseness Score:** 9/10 \n\n **Clarity:** \n\n The sentence is clear and easy to understand. The use of the verb \"didn't\" and the adjective \"tired\" clearly state the reason for her not shopping. \n\n **Clarity Score:** 10/10 \n\n **Grammar:** \n\n The sentence is grammatically correct. The use of the correct tense and punctuation is appropriate. \n\n **Grammar Score:** 10/10 \n\n **Overall:** \n\n The sentence is concise, clear, and grammatically correct. It effectively conveys the information that the woman was too tired to shop. \n\n **Overall Score:** 10/10\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nDescribe scenarios in which the instruction \"Go outside\" can have different meanings/intentions\n\n# Output (b):\nThe instruction \"Go outside\" can have different meanings depending on the situation. For example, if a parent tells their child to go outside to play, it can mean leaving the house and going to a nearby park or play area. But if a doctor tells a patient to go outside, it can mean stepping outside of the hospital or clinic for some fresh air and relaxation. In both cases, the literal act of going outside is the same, but the intent behind the instructions can be drastically different.\n\n# Output (a):\n1.

Leaving the house and coming back inside.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately and completely describe scenarios in which the instruction \"Go outside\" can have different meanings/intentions, as requested by the instruction? \n 2. Does the output contain any additional information or details that are not requested by the instruction, or does it omit any necessary information? \n 3. Does the output clearly and concisely present the scenarios in a way that is easy to understand and follow?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n**1. Literal Interpretation:** \n - The instruction \"go outside\" is interpreted literally, meaning to leave the current indoor space and go into the open air. \n - This intention is clear when the user is indoors and wants to go for a walk, play outside, or engage in activities that require exposure to nature. \n\n **2. Social Engagement:** \n - The instruction \"go outside\" can also be interpreted as an invitation to socialize. \n - For example, it could mean going to the park to meet friends, attending an outdoor event, or simply going for a stroll to interact with the community. \n\n **3. Physical Exercise:** \n - In the context of fitness or exercise, \"go outside\" might imply engaging in outdoor activities such as running, biking, or hiking. \n - This intention is evident when the user is interested in improving their physical well-being. \n\n **4. Mental Health Break:** \n - Sometimes, \"go outside\" can be interpreted as a suggestion for a break from screens and a chance to clear the mind. \n - This intention is relevant when the user is feeling overwhelmed or needs a moment of relaxation. \n\n **5. Exploration and Adventure:** \n - In a broader sense, \"go outside\" can symbolize exploration and adventure. \n - It could mean embarking on a journey to a new place, or simply venturing outside of one's comfort zone. \n\n **6. Environmental Awareness:** \n - In an environmental context, \"go outside\" might encourage the user to connect with nature and appreciate the beauty and importance of the outdoors. \n - This intention is aligned with eco-conscious values. \n\n **7. Cultural or Religious Practices:** \n - In certain cultures or religions, going outside has religious or spiritual significance. \n - For example, in some Native American traditions, going outside is connected to spirituality and connection to the land.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nWrite a script for a 10-second conversation between two characters.\n\n# Output (b):\nPerson A: Hi, how are you?\nPerson B: I'm doing well, how about you? \nPerson A: I'm doing alright, just dealing with a lot of changes.\nPerson B: I understand.

What kind of work do you do?\nPerson A: I'm a digital marketer.\nPerson B: That sounds interesting, what kind of projects have you worked on?\nPerson A: Oh, I've done a lot of different things. \nPerson B: That sounds really cool. \nPerson A: Well, if you're looking for something to do while you're here, why not check out this museum? \nPerson B: Sounds like a plan, I'm always up for discovering new places. \nPerson A: Me too!

Does the output script include all the necessary elements requested in the instruction, such as the characters, setting, and dialogue? \n 3.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nGive me an example of a situation involving the use of a priority queue.\n\n# Output (b):\nA priority queue can be used in a taxi dispatch system. When a customer requests a taxi, the system needs to determine which taxi to send to the customer to minimize the total journey time for all customers. The taxi with the shortest estimated total journey time can be given the highest priority and served first. The system can serve the taxi with the highest priority first until one is served or the queue is empty.\n\n# Output (a):\nFor example, a total order of tasks can be established, with each task having a priority associated with it. Tasks with a higher priority can be given preference and processed before tasks with a lower priority. This ensures that the most important tasks are processed first.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately and completely fulfill the requirements of the instruction, including the requested data structure and its functionality? \n 2. Does the output contain any unnecessary elements or information that is not requested in the instruction? \n 3. Does the output clearly and concisely demonstrate the use of a priority queue in the given situation?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, here's an example: \n\n **You have a list of tasks to complete, and you want to complete them in the order of priority.** \n\n **You can use a priority queue to store the tasks.** \n\n **Here's how you would do it:** \n\n 1. **Create a priority queue:** This will store the tasks in the order of their priority. \n 2. **Add tasks to the priority queue:** Each task will have a priority value associated with it. The higher the priority value, the higher the task will be in the queue. \n 3. **Pop tasks from the priority queue:** As you complete tasks, you can remove them from the priority queue. The tasks will be removed in the order of their priority. \n\n **This is an example of a priority queue in action:** \n\n ```python \n import heapq \n\n # Create a priority queue \n queue = heapq.PriorityQueue() \n\n # Add tasks to the priority queue \n queue.put((1, \"Task 1\")) \n queue.put((3, \"Task 3\")) \n queue.put((2, \"Task 2\")) \n\n # Pop tasks from the priority queue \n while queue: \n     priority, task = heapq.heappop(queue) \n     print(task) \n ``` \n\n **Output:** \n\n ``` \n Task 1 \n Task 2 \n Task 3 \n ``` \n\n In this example, the tasks are added to the priority queue in the order of their priority. The tasks are removed from the priority queue in the order of their priority. This is because the `heappop()` function in Python's `heapq` module returns the item with the lowest priority value first.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The Seahawks' defense had some lapses, allowing the Texans to score 18 points in the second half.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe tone of the article is mostly positive, with an emphasis on Seattle's strong performance in the first half. However, there is a slight tone of frustration in the latter half of the article, with the mention of the Seahawks' \"lapses\" in defense.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe tone of this article is positive, emphasizing the Seahawks' defense as well as their ability to remain competitive against the Texans' offense. Its strong performance is quite impressive according to this article.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately reflect the main point of the instruction, which is to analyze the tone of the article? \n 2. Does the output include all the necessary information requested in the instruction, such as the game played, the score, and the performance of the Seahawks' defense? \n 3. Does the output avoid including unnecessary information or details that are not relevant to the instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nThe tone of the article is neutral and informative. It provides a concise summary of the game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Houston Texans, without expressing any personal opinions or biases.
