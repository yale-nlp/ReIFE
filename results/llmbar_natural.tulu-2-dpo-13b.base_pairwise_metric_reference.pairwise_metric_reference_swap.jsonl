We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\nHer visa to stay here is coming to an end later this year, then she will be forced to return to Malaysia despite opting to stay here if she had the choice. We have gone down the job route, to the point that she was offered the job here, but the employer failed to get a license to issue Visas on very petty grounds.\nI (and others) have suggested getting married. It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years. We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\n\n# Output (a):\nMy girlfriend's visa to stay in the UK expires in a few months, and she wants to stay here, but she won't get married until she goes back to Malaysia.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately capture the main points of the relationship situation, including the girlfriend's visa issue, the couple's desire to get married, and the potential challenges of living in different cultures?\n2. Does the output provide a clear and concise summary of the content, without including unnecessary details or omitting important information?\n3. Does the output maintain a neutral tone and avoid making subjective judgments or offering personal opinions, focusing solely on summarizing the content as per the instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nThe author's girlfriend is Malaysian and studying in the UK. They've been together for 2.5 years, but her visa is ending, forcing her to return to Malaysia. They've explored job opportunities, but the employer couldn't secure a visa.

Does the output address the psychological and physiological factors that contribute to the perception of crunchy sounds as loud and overpowering?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nEating something crunchy can sound loud because the sound of crunching involves a rapid, forceful collision between the hard, crispy food and the soft tissues in your mouth. This creates a distinct, high-pitched sound that can easily capture your attention and stand out from other, softer sounds in the environment. The loudness of the crunching sound can also be amplified by factors such as the size and shape of the food, the force with which it's chewed, and the acoustics of the surrounding environment.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Is it possible for a civilization to have the knowledge and technology to build large telescopes and understand the concept of space flight, but lack the specific resources required to build a rocket?\n2. Could a civilization with advanced telescope technology possess the necessary chemical knowledge and resources to create rocket fuel or alternative propulsion systems?\n3. Are there any alternative scenarios in which a civilization could achieve space flight without relying on the specific resources mentioned in the instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nYes, it is possible for a planet to have life but lack the resources for achieving space flight. In your sci-fi story scenario, it is plausible that a civilization has advanced in various ways, including telescope technology, but lacks the specific resources required for building a rocket. They might not possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals or might be missing other crucial resources like metals or energy sources. This premise can create an interesting storyline for your sci-fi narrative.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nExplain: Pathos, Ethos, Logos \n\n# Output (b):\nPathos is a tool of persuasion that is used to appeal to readers' emotions by arousing positive or negative feelings. It can be used in rhetoric, literature, film, and other forms of expression. While pathos is used to draw an emotional response, the other rhetorical appeals appeal to credibility and logic, respectively. Ethos is the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution. It is often evident as facts, numbers, or statistics and is used to convince an audience of an argument.\n\n# Output (a):\nEthos is the ethical appeal, which is used to convince an audience of the author's credibility or character. Pathos is the emotional appeal, which is used to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions. Logos is the appeal to logic and is used to convince an audience by the use of logic and reason.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output clearly define and differentiate between Pathos, Ethos, and Logos?\n2. Does the output provide specific examples or instances of each appeal (Pathos, Ethos, Logos) in various contexts?\n3. Does the output explain the role and significance of each appeal (Pathos, Ethos, Logos) in persuasive communication?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nPathos, Ethos, and Logos are three persuasive techniques used in communication to appeal to an audience's emotions, credibility, and logic, respectively.\n\n1. Pathos: This technique appeals to the audience's emotions by evoking feelings such as sympathy, empathy, or anger. The goal is to create an emotional connection with the audience, making them more likely to support a particular viewpoint or take action.\n\n2. Ethos: This technique focuses on establishing credibility and trust by appealing to the speaker's authority, character, or expertise. The speaker's reputation, experience, or qualifications are highlighted to persuade the audience that their argument is valid and trustworthy.\n\n3. Logos: This technique appeals to the audience's logic and reasoning by presenting a well-structured, fact-based argument. The goal is to convince the audience through the use of evidence, data, and sound reasoning.\n\nBy using a combination of these techniques, a speaker or writer can create a more persuasive and effective argument, appealing to both the emotions and the intellect of their audience.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nSome people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus stop, half of the people got down and 4 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal? \n\n# Output (b):\nLet's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. \n\nAt the first stop, half of the people got down, so there were x/2 people left on the bus. Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Additionally, 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is x + 4.\n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, and 8 more got in, so the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is (x + 4) + 8.\n\nAccording to the problem, there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop. So, we can set up an equation:\n\nx + (x + 4) + (x + 4) + 8 = 25\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n3x + 12 = 25\n\nSubtracting 12 from both sides:\n\n3x = 13\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\nx = 13/3\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number:\n\nx = 4\n\nSo, 4 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here? I don't really know anything about finance, or what's actually going on. I really want to help my parents, but at the same time I have to protect myself too.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy mom asked me to hide her \u20ac12,000 savings from the bank so that the bank doesn't know about it.

Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here?

Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster. Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Can the output provide specific advice on how to balance pursuing a degree in engineering (IT) and maintaining a passion for physics, particularly in the fields of atomic physics and cosmology?\n2. Does the output address the concern of finding time for the individual's passion while studying engineering, and if so, how?\n3.

Here's some advice to help you balance your passions and practical needs:\n\n1. Explore interdisciplinary fields: Look for engineering disciplines that align with your passion for physics, such as electrical engineering, materials science, or aerospace engineering. This way, you can still pursue your love for physics while gaining practical skills in engineering.\n\n2. Part-time learning: Consider taking online courses or attending evening classes in physics to continue learning about your favorite topics while pursuing engineering. This will help you maintain your passion and keep your options open for the future.\n\n3. Scholarships and financial aid: Look for scholarships and financial aid opportunities that can help alleviate your family's financial burden. This will allow you to focus on your studies without worrying about finances.\n\n4. Communicate with your family: Share your passion for physics with your family and explain how it can benefit you in the long run. Emphasize the importance of pursuing your interests and how it can lead to a fulfilling career.\n\n5. Consider a career change: After gaining experience in engineering, you can always switch to a career that aligns more closely with your passion for physics. This may require additional education or training, but it's important to remember that you have the power to shape your career path.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your well-being and pursue a career that aligns with your passions and values.

Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1.

Are the input and output data formats compatible with the neural network architecture, allowing it to accurately classify cat and dog images?\n3. Does the training dataset contain a sufficient number of cat and dog images to ensure the neural network can accurately distinguish between the two classes?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nTo create a neural network for recognizing cat and dog photographs, follow these steps:\n\n1.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible.

It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach.

Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 2}, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 1}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nWhat is the purpose of the `key` argument in the Python sorted() function and what should I pass as inputs?\n\n# Output (b):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to specify a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the input iterable. The items are then sorted based on the values returned by this function.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to define a key for sorting.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nDescribe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.\n\n# Output (b):\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately describe the main differences between Shakespearean and modern English?\n2. Does the output provide a clear and brief example of these differences using both Shakespearean and modern English?\n3. Does the output maintain the focus on the differences between Shakespearean and modern English, without including unnecessary information or deviating from the instruction's requirements?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nShakespearean English, used in plays written by William Shakespeare during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, differs from modern English in several ways:\n\n1. Vocabulary: Shakespearean English uses a wider range of words and phrases, many of which are now considered archaic or obsolete. For example, \"forswear\" (to swear to give up) instead of \"give up\" or \"quit.\"\n\n2. Grammar: Shakespearean English often employs more complex sentence structures and verb tenses, such as the subjunctive mood, than modern English. For example, \"If I were a wealthy man\" instead of \"If I were rich.\"\n\n3. Pronunciation: Shakespearean English pronunciation differs from modern English, with certain vowel sounds and consonant clusters being pronounced differently. For example, \"he\" was pronounced as \"hay\" in Shakespearean times.\n\n4. Spelling: Shakespearean English spelling was not standardized, and words were often spelled according to their pronunciation. Modern English spelling, however, is more standardized and reflects the pronunciation of words more accurately. For example, \"honour\" was spelled as \"honour\" in Shakespearean times, while in modern English, it is spelled as \"honor.\"\n\nA brief example:\n\nShakespearean: \"To be, or not to be: that is the question\" (from Hamlet)\nModern English: \"To be or not to be, that is the question\"\n\nIn this example, the sentence structure and verb tense are more complex in Shakespearean English, and the spelling and pronunciation have changed in modern English.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.", "output_2": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there?

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nPlease tell me the grammatical structure of this sentence:\n\nWe start by providing a simple weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe grammatical structure of the sentence is as follows:\n\nSubject: \"We\"\nVerb phrase: \"start by providing\"\nObject: \"a simple weight construction\"\nRelative clause modifying the object: \"that shows the equivalence of data transformations.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nThe grammatical structure of the sentence is a statement of fact.

Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nTell the story of the Russian Revolution, in the way of a sarcastic mean girl. Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately convey the key events and significant figures of the Russian Revolution in a sarcastic and mean girl-like tone?\n2. Does the output maintain a consistent sarcastic and mean girl-like tone throughout the narrative of the Russian Revolution?\n3. Are any historical inaccuracies or significant omissions present in the output that may compromise its ability to accurately and sarcastically tell the story of the Russian Revolution?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nOh, sure thing, boss lady! So, there was this super-duper important event called the Russian Revolution. It was like, totally a big deal, but let's be real, it was just a bunch of whiny, entitled Russians wanting a change. \n\nFirst, there was this guy named Nicholas II, who was the Tsar (basically, the king). He was so out of touch with reality that he didn't even know his people were starving and living in poverty. Like, hello? Tsar, you're supposed to be the leader, right? \n\nAnyway, there were these groups called the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, and they were all like, \"Hey, Tsar, you're not doing a great job. Maybe it's time for a change.\" But Tsar Nicholas was like, \"Nah, I'm good. I'm the king, remember?\"\n\nSo, the Bolsheviks, led by this guy named Vladimir Lenin, decided they'd had enough and staged a coup. They took over the government and called it the October Revolution (because it happened in October, duh). \n\nNow, this Lenin guy was a real piece of work. He was all about this thing called communism, where everyone shares everything and there's no private property. Sounds great, right? Except, it didn't really work out that way. \n\nAfter Lenin died, there was this guy named Joseph Stalin who took over. He was like, the meanest, most ruthless leader ever. He killed anyone who disagreed with him, and people were terrified of him. It was like, the ultimate mean girl move.\n\nSo, that's the story of the Russian Revolution. It's like, a cautionary tale about what happens when you don't listen to your people and let a mean girl take over. Just saying.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.", "output_2": "Oh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit?

Emphasize that while your son is learning to ask about nuts, the school staff should also be proactive in ensuring his safety.\n\n2. Provide the school with a detailed list of safe and unsafe foods for your son, as well as a list of alternative snacks that can be provided in case of emergencies.\n\n3. Consider reaching out to local allergy support groups or advocacy organizations to gather additional resources and support.\n\n4. If the school continues to ignore your concerns, consider involving the school board and seeking legal advice if necessary.\n\n5. Continue to educate your son about his allergy and the importance of asking about nuts, but also emphasize that he should not feel responsible for his own safety in this situation.\n\n6.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nCompare and contrast the languages spoken in the United States, following the common requirements of writing a compare-and-contrast essay\n\n# Output (b):\nThe United States is a linguistically diverse country with over 350 languages spoken. The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately identify and explain the key linguistic differences between the languages spoken in the United States?\n2. Does the output provide clear examples to support the comparison and contrast of these languages?\n3. Does the output maintain a neutral stance and avoid any biases or subjective opinions while discussing the languages spoken in the United States?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nTitle: A Comparison of Languages Spoken in the United States\n\nIntroduction:\nThe United States is a melting pot of diverse cultures, and this diversity is reflected in the numerous languages spoken within its borders. In this essay, we will compare and contrast the most prevalent languages spoken in the United States, focusing on their origins, demographics, and linguistic features.\n\nBody Paragraph 1: English\n- Origins: English originated in England and has evolved over time, becoming the primary language of the United States.\n- Demographics: English is the most widely spoken language in the U.S., with approximately 230 million speakers, or about 82% of the population.\n- Linguistic Features: English is a Germanic language with Latin and French influences. It has a vast vocabulary and complex grammar, including verb tenses and subject-verb agreement.\n\nBody Paragraph 2: Spanish\n- Origins: Spanish originated in the Iberian Peninsula and has spread globally due to colonization and migration.\n- Demographics: Spanish is the second most spoken language in the U.S., with approximately 41 million speakers, or about 13% of the population.\n- Linguistic Features: Spanish is a Romance language with Latin roots. It has a simpler grammar system than English, with fewer verb tenses and consistent verb conjugation.\n\nBody Paragraph 3: Chinese\n- Origins: Chinese has multiple dialects, with Mandarin being the most widely spoken. It has a long history, dating back to ancient civilizations in China.\n- Demographics: Chinese is the third most spoken language in the U.S., with approximately 3.3 million speakers, or about 1% of the population.\n- Linguistic Features: Chinese is a tonal language, meaning the same word can have different meanings based on the pitch in which it is spoken. It also has a complex writing system using characters.\n\nBody Paragraph 4: French\n- Origins: French originated in France and has spread globally due to colonization and diplomacy.\n- Demographics: French is the fourth most spoken language in the U.S., with approximately 2.1 million speakers, or about 0.7% of the population.\n- Linguistic Features: French is a Romance language with Latin roots. It has a complex grammar system, including gendered nouns and adjectives, and a variety of verb tenses.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the United States is home to a diverse array of languages, each with its own unique origins, demographics, and linguistic features. English, Spanish, Chinese, and French are just a few examples of the many languages spoken in the U.S. Understanding and appreciating these linguistic differences can foster a more inclusive and multicultural society.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nDo you know of anyone who was unable to become an engineer despite getting the degree and their best efforts? Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the advice address the specific concerns and fears mentioned in the instruction, such as being unable to find an engineering job despite best efforts and the potential impact of accepting a tech/CAD operator position on future engineering opportunities?\n\n2. Does the advice provide practical suggestions or strategies for improving the chances of finding an engineering job, considering the constraints mentioned in the instruction, such as being in a serious relationship and having limited time to turn the situation around?\n\n3. Does the advice acknowledge the challenges the individual has faced in gaining engineering experience, such as limited internship opportunities due to transfer situations, and offer potential solutions or alternative ways to gain relevant experience?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n1. Reassess your job search strategy: Consider expanding your job search beyond Western PA and exploring remote opportunities. This will increase your chances of finding a suitable engineering position.\n\n2. Network: Attend industry events, join professional organizations, and connect with alumni from your university. Networking can lead to valuable job opportunities and insights.\n\n3. Gain relevant experience: Look for volunteer or freelance opportunities in engineering to build your portfolio and showcase your skills. This can help you stand out in interviews and demonstrate your commitment to the field.\n\n4. Tailor your resume and cover letter: Customize your application materials to highlight your relevant skills and experiences. This will help you get noticed by hiring managers.\n\n5. Be open to alternative roles: While you may be focused on a specific type of engineering, consider applying for related roles that can provide valuable experience and lead to engineering positions in the future.\n\n6. Consider further education: If you feel that your current degree is not providing you with the necessary skills, consider pursuing a graduate degree or additional certifications in your desired field.\n\n7. Maintain a positive attitude: Job searching can be challenging, but staying positive and persistent will help you navigate this situation. Remember that it's a competitive job market, and it may take time to find the right opportunity.\n\n8. Seek guidance: Reach out to career counselors, mentors, or professional coaches for advice and support. They can help you identify areas for improvement and provide guidance on your job search.\n\nRemember, it's not uncommon for job seekers to face setbacks in their career. Stay focused, persistent, and continue to develop your skills and experience.

Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nI work at a fully remote software company that has multiple, functional departments that work on different projects that span across the organization. One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the proposed organizational change address the specific problem of lack of alignment on priorities across departments, and how does it aim to resolve workflow bottlenecks?\n2. How does the suggested change promote collaboration and communication among different functional departments to increase the speed of development and improve the company's competitiveness?\n3. Are there any potential drawbacks or challenges in implementing the proposed organizational change, and if so, how can they be mitigated to ensure its effectiveness in addressing the identified issues?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nTo address the issue of misaligned priorities and improve development speed, consider implementing the following organizational changes:\n\n1. Cross-functional collaboration: Encourage regular meetings and communication between departments to ensure everyone is aware of each other's goals and progress. This can help identify potential bottlenecks early and facilitate collaboration.\n\n2. Centralized project management: Establish a centralized project management system to track progress, priorities, and dependencies across departments. This will help ensure that everyone is aware of the status of each project and can plan accordingly.\n\n3. Clear goal-setting and prioritization: Establish a clear process for setting goals and prioritizing tasks within each department. This can help ensure that everyone is working towards the same objectives and that resources are allocated effectively.\n\n4. Regular performance reviews and feedback: Implement regular performance reviews and feedback sessions to help employees understand how their work contributes to the organization's overall goals. This can help align individual priorities with the company's objectives.\n\n5. Empowerment and autonomy: Encourage employees to take ownership of their work and make decisions that align with the company's goals. This can help reduce bottlenecks and increase development speed by allowing teams to work more efficiently.\n\n6. Flexible work arrangements: Offer flexible work arrangements, such as remote work or flexible schedules, to accommodate the needs of different departments and employees. This can help improve work-life balance and reduce stress, leading to increased productivity and job satisfaction.\n\n7. Continuous improvement: Encourage a culture of continuous improvement by regularly reviewing processes and identifying areas for improvement. This can help streamline workflows and increase development speed over time.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you can help align priorities across departments, improve communication and collaboration, and increase development speed, ultimately enhancing your company's competitiveness.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops.

For example, if a parent tells their child to go outside to play, it can mean leaving the house and going to a nearby park or play area. But if a doctor tells a patient to go outside, it can mean stepping outside of the hospital or clinic for some fresh air and relaxation. In both cases, the literal act of going outside is the same, but the intent behind the instructions can be drastically different.\n\n# Output (a):\n1. Going for a walk, either alone or with friends.\n2. Going to a park or other outdoor area to play a game or engage in some activity.\n3. Getting some fresh air or sunshine. \n4. Going to work outside of the house or office.\n5. Going to a store or other commercial establishment that is located outside. \n6. Leaving the house and coming back inside.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output provide at least three distinct scenarios where the instruction \"Go outside\" could have different meanings or intentions?\n2. Does the output accurately represent the various contexts in which the instruction \"Go outside\" could be used, without adding or omitting any relevant situations?\n3. Does the output effectively differentiate between the possible interpretations of the instruction \"Go outside\" in each scenario, highlighting the potential for misunderstanding or miscommunication?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n1. Fresh air: \"Go outside\" can mean to take a break and enjoy some fresh air, especially if someone has been indoors for an extended period.\n\n2. Exercise: It can also mean to engage in physical activity, such as going for a walk, jog, or bike ride.\n\n3. Socializing: In a social context, \"Go outside\" might mean to meet up with friends or family in an outdoor setting.\n\n4. Relaxation: In a therapeutic context, \"Go outside\" can be a suggestion to help someone relax, unwind, and clear their mind by spending time in nature.\n\n5. Safety: In an emergency situation, \"Go outside\" can be a directive to evacuate a building or structure and move to a safer location.\n\n6. Adventure: \"Go outside\" can also mean to embark on an outdoor adventure, such as hiking, camping, or exploring a new location.\n\n7. Learning: In an educational context, \"Go outside\" might mean to conduct a lesson or activity in an outdoor environment, such as a science experiment or nature walk.\n\n8. Creativity: For artists or writers, \"Go outside\" can be a suggestion to find inspiration by observing the world around them.\n\n9. Fresh perspective: In a personal development context, \"Go outside\" can mean to step away from a problem or situation to gain a new perspective or clarity.\n\n10. Fun: Lastly, \"Go outside\" can simply mean to have fun and enjoy the outdoors, whether it's playing a sport, having a picnic, or just soaking up the sunshine.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately represent the core plumbing layout for a two-story house, including all necessary fixtures and connections?\n2. Does the output clearly depict the plumbing system's vertical and horizontal connections between the floors, as well as the distribution of water supply and waste lines?\n3. Does the output provide a detailed description of the plumbing system's components and their placement within the two-story house, including any relevant dimensions and specifications?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nA two-story house's plumbing system typically consists of a water supply line, drainage system, and fixtures such as sinks, toilets, and showers. The water supply line brings clean water from the main water source (e.g., city water or well) to the house. The drainage system carries wastewater from the fixtures to the sewer system or septic tank.\n\nHere's a simplified diagram of a two-story house's plumbing system:\n\n1. Water supply line:\n   - Main water shut-off valve: Controls the water supply to the entire house.\n   - Water meter: Measures water usage.\n   - Water softener (if installed): Removes minerals from the water to prevent scaling and improve water quality.\n   - Cold water supply line: Brings water from the water heater to the fixtures.\n   - Hot water supply line: Brings water from the water heater to the fixtures.\n\n2. Drainage system:\n   - Main drain: Connects all the fixtures' drains to the sewer system or septic tank.\n   - Sink drains: Connect to the main drain via P-traps to prevent sewer gases from entering the house.\n   - Toilet drains: Connect to the main drain via P-traps.\n   - Shower/tub drains: Connect to the main drain via P-traps.\n\n3. Fixtures:\n   - Sinks: Have a faucet for water supply and a drain for wastewater.\n   - Toilets: Have a water supply line for flushing and a drain for wastewater.\n   - Showers/tubs: Have a water supply line for shower/tub and a drain for wastewater.\n\nThis is a basic overview of a two-story house's plumbing system. Actual plumbing systems may vary depending on the specific design and requirements of the house. It's always best to consult a professional plumber for a detailed and accurate plumbing diagram.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you.

However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it.

Habitat: Panthers are found in various habitats, including forests, grasslands, and swamps. They are native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas.\n\n3. Behavior: Panthers are typically solitary animals, only coming together for mating. They are mostly active at night and are skilled climbers and swimmers.\n\n4. Size: Panthers are large cats, with adult males weighing between 60-200 pounds (27-90 kg) and females weighing between 30-100 pounds (14-45 kg).\n\n5. Vocalizations: Panthers communicate through various vocalizations, such as growls, roars, and meows.\n\n6. Tracks: Panther tracks are typically large, measuring around 3-4 inches (7.6-10 cm) long and 2-3 inches (5-7.6 cm) wide.\n\n7. Sightings: Panthers are elusive animals, so sightings are rare.
