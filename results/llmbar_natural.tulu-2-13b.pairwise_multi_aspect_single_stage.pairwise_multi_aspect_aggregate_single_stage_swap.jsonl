{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\nHer visa to stay here is coming to an end later this year, then she will be forced to return to Malaysia despite opting to stay here if she had the choice. We have gone down the job route, to the point that she was offered the job here, but the employer failed to get a license to issue Visas on very petty grounds.\nI (and others) have suggested getting married. It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years. We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\n\n# Output (a):\nMy girlfriend's visa to stay in the UK expires in a few months, and she wants to stay here, but she won't get married until she goes back to Malaysia.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?", "winner": 1, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nComplete a brief story given the following first sentence.

Yet when the forecast report came back positive!\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides relevant information about the weatherman learning his weather report and preparing for his forecast.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Any integer smaller than -4 or larger than 4 will violate the inequality. Therefore, there are a total of 9 integers that satisfy |x + 10| < 5.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe inequality |x + 5| < 10 means that the absolute value of x + 5 is less than 10.\nSince the absolute value is always non-negative, this is equivalent to -10 < x + 5 < 10.\nSubtracting 5 from all parts, we get -15 < x < 5.\nTherefore, the solution set contains all integers between -15 and 5, exclusive. \nThere are 5 - (-15) - 1 = 19 integers in the solution set.\n\nSo the number of integers in the solution is 19\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I'm all for texting with people about small stuff, but having a conversation via text is difficult. It's impossible to say everything you want to say without writing an essay and there is tons of room for miscommunication. I find that the conversation are very superficial when texting. Mostly they go like \"Hey\" \"How are you what are you doing\" etc. I'm getting bored with superficial talk. I crave more deeper and intellectually stimulating conversations. He says he hates talk on the phone and when I call him, he has nothing to say and sounds bored. I offered to video chat or something, but he doesn't want to try. \nWe don't see each other often, so we end up going long periods of time without seeing or hearing each other, only texting. I feel no connection when we text. He sees no problem with this. Am I wrong to be annoyed?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend only likes to text me for shallow conversation. I want deeper and intellectually stimulating conversations. Am I wrong to be annoyed?\n\n# Output (a):\nBoyfriend only likes to talk through text. He sees no issue with it.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (a) is more concise and coherent, while Output (b) has a slightly better flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more information by mentioning the specific issue of shallow conversation, while Output (b) only states the desire for deeper conversations without elaborating on the problem.\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs address the user's intention, but Output (a) asks for clarification on whether the user is annoyed, which shows more effort in understanding the user's concern.\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately represent the user's concerns.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to summarize the content.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better due to its concise and coherent structure, the additional information it provides, and its effort to clarify the user's intention. While Output (b) is also accurate and addresses the user's concern, it lacks the richness of information and clarification that Output (a) offers.", "logprobs": [{"1": -0.016690148040652275}, {".":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nComplete a brief story given the following first sentence.\n\nOne day my wife and I were on the bench in front of our building.\n\n# Output (b):\nWe were expecting a refund. the next week, the store had an iPad. The next week, the other kids were transferred to the store. We were all the best we had ever washed the car.\n\n# Output (a):\nMy wife felt very down so I started to play a game. She ended up making a lot of friends on the bench. She had a big smile on her face to show her appreciation. I had fun that day.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. It is free of spelling and grammatical errors.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I am looking to write a sci-fi story. The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

It also offers some creative ideas and solutions, such as the use of electric vehicles and silicon-based life. Output (b) provides more technical information about the potential well and the required size of rockets, but it does not offer any creative solutions or insights.\n\n3.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her? Again, sorry for my bad english =/\n\n# Output (b):\nI want to give some advice to my 17-year-old sister to avoid risky situations while drunk, without instilling rape fear or guilt in her. How would you advise me to phrase my advice?\n\n# Output (a):\nI want to tell my sister that she should avoid getting drunk with people she doesn't know or trust to avoid drowning risk, but I also want to make her aware that rape fear is a serious issue.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nExplain: Pathos, Ethos, Logos \n\n# Output (b):\nPathos is a tool of persuasion that is used to appeal to readers' emotions by arousing positive or negative feelings. It can be used in rhetoric, literature, film, and other forms of expression. While pathos is used to draw an emotional response, the other rhetorical appeals appeal to credibility and logic, respectively. Ethos is the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution. It is often evident as facts, numbers, or statistics and is used to convince an audience of an argument.\n\n# Output (a):\nEthos is the ethical appeal, which is used to convince an audience of the author's credibility or character. Pathos is the emotional appeal, which is used to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions. Logos is the appeal to logic and is used to convince an audience by the use of logic and reason.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

At the first bus stop, half of the people got down and 4 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal? \n\n# Output (b):\nLet's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. \n\nAt the first stop, half of the people got down, so there were x/2 people left on the bus. Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here? I don't really know anything about finance, or what's actually going on. I really want to help my parents, but at the same time I have to protect myself too.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy mom asked me to hide her \u20ac12,000 savings from the bank so that the bank doesn't know about it. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Output (a):\nI'm a student in Ireland. I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides relevant information about the situation and the user's concern, but it lacks specific details about the legal implications and potential risks. Output (b) is more informative, as it directly addresses the user's concern about the legality of hiding money from the bank.\n\n3.

I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here?

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster. Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. It is also free of spelling and grammatical errors. Output (b) is also well-structured and coherent, but it contains a few minor spelling and grammatical errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides relevant information about the differences between physics and IT, and how pursuing a dual degree or an engineering physics program can help the user achieve their goals. Output (b) provides information about the author's degree and research area, but it does not directly address the user's question about balancing their passion for physics with an engineering degree.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs address the user's question, but Output (a) provides more relevant information and helpful suggestions.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs contain accurate information.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction by providing advice on the situation described.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it provides more relevant information and helpful suggestions to the user. While Output (b) contains some useful information, it does not directly address the user's question about balancing their passion for physics with an engineering degree. The importance of providing relevant information and helpful suggestions is more critical in this context, as the user is seeking advice on a personal and career-related matter.", "logprobs": [{"1":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nHow do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity? \n\n# Output (b):\nVaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of a virus or bacteria, or parts of its structure such as proteins, into a person's body. The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

But is this a cop-out?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy Indian parents disapprove of my white boyfriend for his ethnicity and will probably be upset if he visits me while I'm abroad. Should I tell them about his visit, or just enjoy his company without dealing with family drama?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy boyfriend is visiting me while I'm in Europe, and I don't know if I should tell my parents about it.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

We have been in a relationship for 2 years and have been best friends for 2 before that. He loves always having plans and hanging out with people, which I also sometimes enjoy doing but I also need nights where we can just stay in and watch movies or do nothing. Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns. How do I get him to see my point of view?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend is an extrovert and loves to hang out with friends, I am an introvert and need nights alone to relax. He doesn't understand my need for a night in, and it puts me under stress. How do I get him to understand?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy boyfriend and I are always busy and I need a night in. He thinks I'm being lazy and doesn't understand why I need a night in.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGenerate two rhymes for the following word. Moon\n\n# Output (b):\nClone, June, Nore, Tune\n\n# Output (a):\nSoon, Loon\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction of generating rhymes for the word \"moon.\"\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it provides a more diverse and creative set of rhymes, fulfilling the instruction more comprehensively.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGiven the following input statement, provide the type of sentiment in the statement and the extent of sentiment in terms of sentiment scores.

User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs accurately address the user's intention, which is to determine the sentiment in the statement and its extent.\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately identify the sentiment in the statement as positive.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction by providing the type of sentiment and the sentiment score.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it provides more information about the sentiment score scale, which is relevant to the instruction.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training. Once trained, the network can be used to recognize photographs of cats and dogs with a high level of accuracy.\n\n# Output (a):\nSure! Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to design a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. However, Output (a) includes a test of the function, which is not explicitly mentioned in the instruction but is a good practice to demonstrate the function's correctness.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it provides a more informative and helpful explanation of the function, which makes it easier for someone who is not familiar with the concept of a function to understand. Additionally, Output (a) includes a test of the function, which is a good practice to demonstrate the function's correctness.", "logprobs": [{"1": -0.018626537173986435}, {".": -2.50339189733495e-06},

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a detailed description of John's walk through the forest, including the sights and sounds he experiences.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Output (b) only provides the Julian calendar date, which is less informative.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs directly address the user's instruction, but Output (a) also provides additional information that may be helpful for the user.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their respective ways. Output (a) is accurate in stating that the Julian calendar is 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar in the year 2020.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (a) is more concise and easier to read, as it uses a single line of code to generate the array.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more information by explaining the purpose of the function and its parameters, as well as the logic behind the function. Output (a) only provides the code to generate the array without any additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs fulfill the user's intention of generating an array of random numbers from 1 to 100. However, Output (b) is more helpful by providing a clear explanation of the function and its parameters, which can be useful for someone who is not familiar with the code.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in generating an array of random numbers from 1 to 100.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) is more complete in following the instruction by providing a complete function with a clear explanation of its purpose and parameters. Output (a) only provides the code to generate the array without any additional information.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it is more informative, provides a complete function, and follows the instruction more closely.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGenerate one hypothetical situation in which a person is feeling sad.\n\n# Output (b):\nA hypothetical situation in which a person is feeling sad could be an unexpected change at work, such as a reduction in pay or loss of a job. It could also be a sudden break-up with a partner or a death in the family. Other common triggers are feeling left out or neglected by friends, or feeling isolated and alone.\n\n# Output (a):\nA hypothetical situation in which someone is feeling sad could be that of a teenage girl who has just moved to a new city and is finding it hard to make friends. She is lonely and homesick and feels like no one understands her. She is having a hard time adjusting to her new surroundings and is feeling down in the dumps.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

Output (b) is more general and does not provide specific examples or additional information.\n\n3.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGive a helpful response to the following statement: My bag is lost.\n\n# Output (b):\nI'm sorry to hear about your loss.\n\n# Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried searching for it or notified authorities like the police?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference: Both outputs are appropriate in response to the user's statement, but Output (a) is more helpful in providing relevant information and asking for clarification.\n4. Accuracy: Both outputs are accurate in their responses.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: Both outputs follow the instruction to provide a helpful response to the user's statement.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it is more helpful and informative, providing specific suggestions for searching and notifying authorities.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWhat is the purpose of the `key` argument in the Python sorted() function and what should I pass as inputs?\n\n# Output (b):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to specify a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the input iterable. The items are then sorted based on the values returned by this function.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to define a key for sorting. It is used to tell the function how to compare two strings to determine which one should be placed before the other in the sorted output.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (a) is more coherent and has a clearer flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more relevant information about the purpose of the `key` argument in the Python sorted() function, while Output (b) focuses more on how the `key` function works. Output (a) is more informative in this case.\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs address the user's intention, but Output (a) is more specific and directly answers the question about the purpose of the `key` argument.\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their explanations.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction and provide the required information.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it provides a more accurate and informative answer to the user's question, while also being more coherent and easier to understand. The importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task is as follows: text quality (3), information richness (2), user intention inference (1), accuracy (4), and completeness of

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGiven a base number and a power, calculate the result.\n\nBase:5   Power:3\n\n# Output (b):\n125\n\n# Output (a):\n5 x 5 x 5 = 625\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGenerate a realistic mathematical equation for the students to solve.\n\n# Output (b):\n2 + 2 = 4.\n\n# Output (a):\nx+4 = 5\nwhere x is a real number.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs directly address the instruction, but Output (a) is more helpful in providing a realistic equation that students can work with.\n\n4.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nProvide a suitable synonym for the word 'deceptive' that is in a formal tone.\n\n# Output (b):\nCunning.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe word that best matches the synonym of 'deceptive' is 'misleading'.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs address the user's intention, but Output (a) more directly provides the requested information.\n\n4.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction, but Output (a) more directly addresses the formal tone requirement.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it directly provides a suitable synonym for 'deceptive' in a formal tone, while also addressing the formal tone requirement in the instruction.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWrite an SQL query to find all words that start with the letter 'd'.\n\n# Output (b):\nSELECT word FROM table WHERE word LIKE 'd%';\n\n# Output (a):\nSELECT word FROM words WHERE word = 'd';\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

It should offer high-quality, original information that is regularly updated to remain current. Multimedia elements like images, videos, and infographics should complement the text to enhance understanding and retain user interest. Clear, concise language and well-structured formatting, including short paragraphs, bullet points, and subheadings, make the content easily digestible. Above all, the content should provide genuine value to the user, addressing their needs or queries while maintaining authenticity and credibility.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe ideal website should have a clean, modern, and visually appealing look. It should have a well-organized layout with a consistent color scheme that aligns with the brand's identity. The website should also have a responsive design, meaning it should look good and function well on all devices.\n\nIn terms of feel, the website should be user-friendly and intuitive. The website should also make users feel secure, especially if they're required to enter personal information or make a purchase.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a good overview of the ideal website's look and feel, but it lacks specific details and examples. Output (b) provides more detailed information about the ideal website's content, including multimedia elements and formatting techniques.\n\n3.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nDescribe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.\n\n# Output (b):\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their descriptions of the differences between Shakespearean and modern English.\n5.

Although Output (b) provides more detailed information, it is less concise and contains a redundant question for clarification. Output (a) is more concise, easier to read, and still provides relevant information.

The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.", "output_2": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people.

Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.", "output_2": "Oh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs do not infer the user's intention as they directly answer the question.\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their respective answers.\n5.

The importance of text quality, information richness, and completeness of instruction following are more critical in this context, as the instruction is straightforward and only requires a direct

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit? The school might not see the problem with their actions, but their insurance might. Maybe submitting a claim would get their attention?\n\n# Output (a):\nThese people can\u2019t be trusted whatsoever, you should make a scene at his school to show people the consequences of their ill behavior.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Maybe submitting a claim would get their attention?", "instruction": "Provide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nSon has a peanut allergy, and the school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts. This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

Accuracy:\nBoth outputs provide accurate information about the languages spoken in the United States.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the common requirements of writing a compare-and-contrast essay.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it provides more detailed and accurate information about the languages spoken in the United States, following the common requirements of writing a compare-and-contrast essay.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nDo you know of anyone who was unable to become an engineer despite getting the degree and their best efforts? Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nCombine the following words in the list by giving an example sentence. Words: flexible, practical, smart.\n\n# Output (b):\nA car with flexible, practical, and smart features.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe combined feature is \"flexible and smart\".\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Its heat was inviting, but it also posed a danger.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe warmth of the fire was comforting, filling the room with a pleasant orange glow. But despite its welcoming warmth, it also presented a danger.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe fire's warmth was comforting and inviting, filling the room with a pleasant orange glow. It was a danger that could not be ignored.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nName three public figures and their occupation who support renewable energy\n\n# Output (b):\nThree public figures who support renewable energy include Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n# Output (a):\n1.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, environmentalist, and philanthropist.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWhat is an antonym for the word \"cogent\"?\n\n# Output (b):\nunconvincing\n\n# Output (a):\nThe antonym of the word \"cogent\" is \"irrelevant\".\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

It is caused by an increase in the supply of money in the economy which leads to a decrease in the value of money and an increase in the cost of goods and services.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more information about the origin of the phrase \"Who wears short shorts?\" However, the instruction only asks for a general discussion of the phrase, so Output (a) is more relevant in this aspect.\n\n3.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nDetect if the following item is a prime number: 17\n\n# Output (b):\nNo, 17 is not a prime number.\n\n# Output (a):\nYes, 17 is a prime number.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs directly address the user's intention, but Output (a) provides more relevant information by confirming that 17 is a prime number.\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is accurate in its response, while Output (b) is not, as 17 is indeed a prime number.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to detect if the given item is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nCan you provide a syntactic inversion of the following sentence?\nThe trees were covered with snow.\n\n# Output (b):\nCovered with snow were the trees.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe trees were not covered with snow.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, a neural network can be used to tell you if an image is showing a cat or a dog. What are the basic mathematical requirements needed to get into neural networks? Please give me the basic requirements as completely as possible. Note that I don't mean to be an expert but a good AI engineer.\n\n# Output (b):\nGenerally, you should have a good understanding of:\n- linear algebra, especially of matrix operations\n- calculus, including computing derivatives\n- probabilities and statistics\n\n# Output (a):\nHaving a basic understanding of the math behind neural networks is really important to understand how they work in case you need to debug or optimize your algorithm. It would be better to have a good understanding of some mathematics topics:\n\n1. Numbers and counting: Numbers can be thought of as the building blocks of mathematics. There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events. It is a way pivotal part of many areas of mathematics, science, technology, and more. It is also helpful for simply interacting with other people and the world around us. Everyday examples of measurements include height, weight, temperature, and distance.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

important to understand how they work in case you need to debug or optimize your algorithm. It would be better to have a good understanding of some mathematics topics:\n\n1. Numbers and counting: Numbers can be thought of as the building blocks of mathematics. There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events. It is a way pivotal part of many areas of mathematics, science, technology, and more. It is also helpful for simply interacting with other people and the world around us. Everyday examples of measurements include height, weight, temperature, and distance.", "output_2": "Generally, you should have a good understanding of:\n- linear algebra, especially of matrix operations\n- calculus, including computing derivatives\n- probabilities and statistics", "instruction": "A neural network is a network of algorithms used to solve classification problems.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nAnalyze given speech for sentiment:\nI'm so grateful for the help and support that I received from my family.\n\n# Output (b):\nPositive sentiment.\n\n# Output (a):\nNegative sentiment\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs do not provide any relevant information or inference to clarify the user's intention.\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is inaccurate, as the sentiment of the given speech is positive, not negative as stated.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to analyze the sentiment of the given speech.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (b) is better overall.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nRevise the following statement so that it is grammatically correct:\nThe history of the United Sates are full of remarkable milestones\n\n# Output (b):\nThe history of the United States is full of remarkable milestones.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe history of the United States are full of remarkable milestones.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a concise and direct answer to the instruction, which is to determine the day of the week for a given date. Output (b) provides a function that can be used to determine the day of the week for a given date, but it does not provide any additional information or examples.\n\n3.

Output (b) also follows the instruction by providing a function that can be used to determine the day of the week for a given date.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it provides a more direct and concise answer to the instruction, while also being accurate and following the instruction completely.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

It suggests that someone did not do something because they were too tired, when in fact there may be other reasons why they did not shop. It could be interpreted as someone trying to avoid responsibility or justify their actions.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe sentence means that the person decided not to shop because they lacked the energy to do so. This shows that the person is either too busy or too exhausted to shop, indicating that they may be busy with other activities or just might not have the energy to shop. This sentence also reveals the person's lack of interest in shopping, which could be due to financial or time constraints.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (a) is more coherent and has a clearer and more logical flow of ideas.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed and professional information, as it explains the possible reasons for the person not shopping and highlights their lack of interest in shopping. Output (b) is more general and does not provide any specific information about the person's situation.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs attempt to infer the user's intention, but Output (a) is more successful in providing relevant information and asking for clarification if needed.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their analysis of the sentence.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to analyze the sentence.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better due to its higher text quality, richer information, and more successful user intention inference. While both outputs are accurate and follow the instruction, Output (a) provides more relevant and detailed information, making it a better response to the given instruction.", "logprobs": [{"1":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, if a parent tells their child to go outside to play, it can mean leaving the house and going to a nearby park or play area. But if a doctor tells a patient to go outside, it can mean stepping outside of the hospital or clinic for some fresh air and relaxation. In both cases, the literal act of going outside is the same, but the intent behind the instructions can be drastically different.\n\n# Output (a):\n1. Going for a walk, either alone or with friends.\n2. Going to a park or other outdoor area to play a game or engage in some activity.\n3. Getting some fresh air or sunshine. \n4. Going to work outside of the house or office.\n5. Going to a store or other commercial establishment that is located outside. \n6. Leaving the house and coming back inside.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

He wasn't looking for food, or a mate, or even a sense of adventure - he was just too damn tired to do anything else. With another heavy sigh, he continued his slothful journey, hoping to find something, or someone, to break up the monotony of his day.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors.

Output (b) is more concise and lacks depth, only mentioning the elephant's avoidance of other animals.\n\n3.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nReformat the sentence so it is a question: I was surprised by the outcome.\n\n# Output (b):\nWhat was most surprising was the outcome.\n\n# Output (a):\nWhat surprised you about the outcome?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs infer the user's intention well, as they both reformatted the sentence into a question asking about the surprise related to the outcome.\n\n4.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGiven a list of numbers and the letter \"a\", sort the list in the following order: All the even numbers followed by \"a\" followed by all the odd numbers.\nList of numbers: 5, 2, 9, 12, 8, 6, a, 11\n\n# Output (b):\n2, 12, 8, 6, a, 5, 9, 11\n\n# Output (a):\n5, 8, 12, 2, 6, 11, a, 9, 1\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs follow the user's intention, but Output (a) is more helpful by providing additional information on the sorting process.\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in presenting the sorted list.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to sort the list in the given order.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better due to its better text quality, more helpful information richness, and completeness of instruction following.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nCreate an original proverb that describes friendship.\n\n# Output (b):\nIn the garden of life, true friends are the flowers that never wither.\n\n# Output (a):\nA friend in need is a friend indeed.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (a) is more concise and directly answers the question, while Output (b) provides additional information that is not necessary for the task.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more information than necessary for the task, as it repeats the original list of numbers and adds the statement \"The result of dividing the list of numbers by 10 is [5, 15, 17, 20, 39].\" Output (a) provides the correct result in a more concise manner.\n\n3.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nInfer the implied meaning of the following sentence: She is not what she used to be.\n\n# Output (b):\nShe has changed substantially over time.\n\n# Output (a):\nShe is not as she once was.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

When a customer requests a taxi, the system needs to determine which taxi to send to the customer to minimize the total journey time for all customers. The taxi with the shortest estimated total journey time can be given the highest priority and served first. The system can serve the taxi with the highest priority first until one is served or the queue is empty.\n\n# Output (a):\nFor example, a total order of tasks can be established, with each task having a priority associated with it. Tasks with a higher priority can be given preference and processed before tasks with a lower priority. This ensures that the most important tasks are processed first.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

The Seahawks' defense had some lapses, allowing the Texans to score 18 points in the second half.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe tone of the article is mostly positive, with an emphasis on Seattle's strong performance in the first half. However, there is a slight tone of frustration in the latter half of the article, with the mention of the Seahawks' \"lapses\" in defense.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe tone of this article is positive, emphasizing the Seahawks' defense as well as their ability to remain competitive against the Texans' offense. Its strong performance is quite impressive according to this article.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1.

I believe in Jesus Christ\n\n# Output (b):\nThe best way to defeat depression can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their condition. However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, don't hesitate to seek help.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe best way to defeat a demon is to use the power of God. Jesus Christ has the authority and power to defeat demons and to set the captive free. The Bible teaches us to pray to God for help in times of trouble, and to seek His will in our lives. God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful. But God is greater than any demon, and He has the power to defeat them. Trust in God and He will help you.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful.

However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nRewrite the given sentence to make it more expressive and keep its meaning unchanged: She was caught in the heavy rain.\n\n# Output (b):\nShe was soaked in a sudden downpour as she made her way home.\n\n# Output (a):\nShe found herself drenched in the pouring rain.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured, fluent, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. They are also coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a more detailed description of the situation, using the phrase \"found herself drenched,\" which adds a sense of unexpectedness and immediacy to the situation. Output (b) is also informative, but it is less descriptive and lacks the same level of detail as Output (a).\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs accurately follow the instruction to make the sentence more expressive while keeping its meaning unchanged.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence and maintain its core message.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs successfully rewrite the sentence to make it more expressive while keeping its meaning unchanged.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better. While both outputs are well-written and informative, Output (a) provides a more detailed and expressive description of the situation, making it a better choice for fulfilling the instruction task.",
