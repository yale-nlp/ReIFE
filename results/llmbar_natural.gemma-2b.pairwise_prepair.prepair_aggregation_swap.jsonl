We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\nHer visa to stay here is coming to an end later this year, then she will be forced to return to Malaysia despite opting to stay here if she had the choice. We have gone down the job route, to the point that she was offered the job here, but the employer failed to get a license to issue Visas on very petty grounds.\nI (and others) have suggested getting married. It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years.

I am looking to write a sci-fi story. The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.

Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster.

The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training.

Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision.

For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3.

However, some of the synonyms are more suitable for a more negative connotation than others. For example, \"candidate\" and \"pensive\" suggest a more subdued sadness than \"anguished\" or \"devastated\". \n\n **Drawbacks:** \n\n * The output does not provide any synonyms with a strong negative connotation. \n * Some synonyms are more suitable for a more specific type of sadness (e.g., \"mournful\" for grief, \"anguished\" for pain). \n\n **Overall, the output is somewhat helpful but could be improved by providing more synonyms with a stronger negative connotation.**\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n ## Evaluation: \n\n **Critical Drawbacks:** \n\n * The output does not provide any synonyms for \"sad\". It provides only 5 synonyms that are related to sadness, but they are not synonyms in the original instruction. \n * The output is not helpful, as it does not provide any information that could be used to understand the instruction. \n * The output is not accurate, as it contains a factual error (the word \"doleful\" is not a synonym for \"sad\"). \n * The output is not detailed, as it does not provide any context or background information. \n * The output is not harmless, as it could be used to evoke negative emotions in the reader. \n\n **Overall, the output is of low quality and does not meet the evaluation rules.**\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": " Therefore, Output (a) is better.  \n\n The output provides more synonyms with a strong negative connotation, is helpful, accurate, detailed, harmless, and relevant to the instruction.", "logprobs": [{"Therefore": -0.1371249556541443}, {",": -1.6689286894688848e-06}, {" Output": -0.0004536076739896089}, {" (": -0.00039915222441777587}, {"a": -0.5231438875198364}, {")": -5.960462772236497e-07}, {" is": -3.218599158572033e-05}, {" better": -0.0005806190893054008}, {".": -0.013493405655026436}, {" ": -0.668559193611145}, {"\n\n": -0.016225432977080345}, {"The": -0.05957559123635292}, {" output": -0.04990144073963165}, {" provides": -0.10445313900709152}, {" more": -0.24185332655906677}, {" synonyms": -0.6005129814147949}, {" with": -0.282892107963562}, {" a": -0.004347516223788261}, {" strong": -0.6352050304412842}, {" negative": -0.0003295593778602779}, {" connotation": -5.2927523938706145e-05}, {",": -0.223497211933136}, {" is": -0.14673617482185364}, {" helpful": -0.09745918214321136}, {",": -0.2954675853252411}, {" accurate": -0.0611506886780262}, {",": -0.006002968642860651}, {" detailed": -0.06589328497648239}, {",": -0.012927415780723095}, {" harmless": -0.00024816294899210334}, {",": -0.0226161926984787}, {" and": -0.007629185914993286}, {" relevant": -1.2022229433059692}, {" to": -0.006509765516966581}, {" the": -1.168244216387393e-05}, {" instruction": -0.0259773638099432}, {".": -0.0018999397289007902}, {"<eos>": -0.46208465099334717}], "tokens": ["Therefore", ",", " Output", " (", "a", ")", " is", " better", ".", " ", "\n\n", "The", " output", " provides", " more", " synonyms", " with", " a", " strong", " negative", " connotation", ",", " is", " helpful", ",", " accurate", ",", " detailed", ",", " harmless", ",", " and", " relevant", " to", " the", " instruction", ".", "<eos>"]}], "data": {"output_1": "1. gloomy\n2. morose\n3. sorrowful\n4. despairing\n5. melancholy\n6. doleful\n7. glum\n8. afflicted\n9. mournful\n10. despondent", "output_2": "Astounded, Beleaguered, Brooding, Candidate, Circumstantial, Languid, Mournful, Musing, Nostalgic, Pensive", "instruction": "List 10 synonyms for 'sad'.", "winner": 1}, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 1}

The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world.

We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit?

The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country.

One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\n ## Evaluation: \n\n **Honesty:** The output is truthful and accurately reflects the problem statement. \n\n **Precision:** The output provides a comprehensive overview of potential solutions to the problem, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc. \n\n **Completeness:** The output addresses all the key aspects of the problem, including workflow bottlenecks, alignment on priorities, and the need for cross-functional collaboration. \n\n **Harmlessness:** The output does not suggest any harmful or unethical solutions. \n\n **Creativity:** The output suggests creative and effective solutions that could potentially improve the company's competitiveness. \n\n **Overall:** The output effectively addresses the problem statement and provides a range of potential solutions that could be implemented to resolve the issue. \n\n **Drawbacks:** \n\n * The output could be more specific about the proposed solutions. \n * The output could provide more details about the implementation of the solutions.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n ## Evaluation: \n\n **Strengths:** \n\n * The output is clear, concise, and easy to understand. \n * It provides several potential solutions to the problem of lack of alignment on priorities. \n * It is creative and engaging, which could be effective in motivating team members. \n\n **Weaknesses:** \n\n * The output does not provide any specific details about the proposed solutions. \n * It does not provide any justification or evidence to support the claims made. \n * It could be argued that the game of musical chairs is not a feasible solution for a fully remote company. \n\n **Recommendations:** \n\n * Provide more specific details about the proposed solutions. \n * Provide justification and evidence to support the claims made. \n * Explore alternative solutions that may be more suitable for a fully remote company. \n\n **Overall:** \n\n The output is a good starting point for a discussion about improving alignment and workflow in a fully remote software company.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the\nbetter.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.\n\nYou should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.
