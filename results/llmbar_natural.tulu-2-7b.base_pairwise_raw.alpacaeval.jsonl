This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\"\"\",\n}\n\n## Model Outputs\n\nHere are the unordered outputs from the models.

However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect.
