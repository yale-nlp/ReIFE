We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\nHer visa to stay here is coming to an end later this year, then she will be forced to return to Malaysia despite opting to stay here if she had the choice.

It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years.

This can also influence how much we consume.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe sound is transmitted through the vibrations of your jawbone and skull directly to your inner ear, so it can seem much louder than most other sounds.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output explain the reason behind the loudness of crunchy food sounds compared to other sounds?\n2.

The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nSome people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus stop, half of the people got down and 4 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal? \n\n# Output (b):\nLet's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. \n\nAt the first stop, half of the people got down, so there were x/2 people left on the bus. Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Does the output follow the instruction by only providing the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, without including any additional or unnecessary information?\n3.

And 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus increased by 4 - (1/2)x.\n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got in, so the total number of people on the bus increased by 8 - 6 = 2.\n\nWe know that there are a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + (4 - (1/2)x) + 2 = 25\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\nx + 4 - (1/2)x + 2 = 25\n(5/2)x + 2 = 25\n(5/2)x = 23\nx = 23 * (2/5)\nx = 9.2\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a person, we round down x to 9.\n\nSo, 9 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nI don't want to be an engineer, I like physics. Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster. Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output provide specific advice on balancing the pursuit of a passion for physics and an engineering degree, addressing time management concerns?\n2. Does the output offer potential solutions or alternatives for supporting the family financially while still focusing on the love for physics and atomic/cosmological studies?\n3. Does the output honestly and precisely address the dilemma between choosing engineering and physics, considering the personal interests and family situation?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nIt's great that you have a clear passion for physics! Pursuing a degree in engineering while maintaining your interest in physics is possible. Here are some tips:\n\n1. Choose a relevant engineering field: Information Technology (IT) might not directly relate to physics, but you can consider other engineering disciplines like Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or Aerospace Engineering, which have stronger connections to physics and may interest you.\n\n2. Take relevant courses: If you decide to pursue IT, try to take elective courses in physics or related subjects during your degree. This will help you stay engaged with your passion and potentially open up opportunities in interdisciplinary fields.\n\n3. Participate in extracurricular activities: Join clubs, societies, or research groups related to physics, either within your university or in your community. This will help you network with like-minded people and stay connected to your passion.\n\n4. Summer internships: Look for internships in physics research labs, national research facilities, or companies that require physics knowledge. This will give you practical experience and help you understand how your passion can be applied in the real world.\n\n5. Financial support: Apply for scholarships, grants, or financial aid to help alleviate your family's financial burden. Many universities and organizations offer financial support for students pursuing degrees in STEM fields.\n\n6. Be open to interdisciplinary opportunities: There are many fields that combine engineering and physics, such as materials science, nanotechnology, and quantum computing. Explore these interdisciplinary areas to find a career path that aligns with your passion and supports your family.\n\nRemember, it's essential to communicate with your parents about your interests and concerns. Explain how pursuing your passion can lead to a fulfilling and successful career, and work together to find a solution that benefits both you and your family.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nHow do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity? \n\n# Output (b):\nVaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of a virus or bacteria, or parts of its structure such as proteins, into a person's body. The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output clearly explain the mechanism of how vaccinations protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases?\n2. Does the output accurately define and describe the concept of herd immunity in the context of vaccinations?\n3. Does the output provide relevant examples or additional information to support the understanding of vaccination and herd immunity?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nVaccinations work by introducing a small, harmless piece of a virus or bacteria to the body, which triggers the immune system to create specific antibodies to fight that particular pathogen. This immunity protects individuals from future infections.\n\nHerd immunity occurs when a large portion of a population becomes immune to a specific disease, either through vaccination or natural infection. This makes it difficult for the disease to spread, as there are fewer susceptible individuals for it to infect. As a result, even those who are not immune (such as newborns, elderly, or immunocompromised individuals) are indirectly protected because the disease has a lower chance of spreading within the community.\n\nIn summary, vaccinations protect individuals by stimulating their immune systems to create antibodies, and herd immunity protects communities by reducing the spread of diseases.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns.

This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him.

This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\".

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nCreate a neural network for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs.\n\n# Output (b):\nA neural network can be used for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs. The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training. Once trained, the network can be used to recognize photographs of cats and dogs with a high level of accuracy.\n\n# Output (a):\nSure! Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately classify both cats and dogs in the photographs using a neural network model?\n2. Does the output specifically address the creation of a neural network for cat and dog recognition, without including other unrelated tasks or features?\n3. Does the output adhere to the given instruction by focusing on the creation of a neural network for recognizing cat and dog photographs, without providing excess or insufficient information?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nTo create a neural network for recognizing cat and dog photographs, follow these steps:\n\n1. Gather data: Collect a large dataset of labeled cat and dog images. Ensure the dataset is diverse and representative of various breeds, poses, and backgrounds.\n\n2. Preprocess data: Resize images to a standard size, normalize pixel values, and convert images to grayscale or RGB format. You may also want to augment the dataset by applying random transformations like rotation, flipping, and cropping.\n\n3. Split data: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set will be used to teach the neural network, the validation set will help tune hyperparameters, and the testing set will evaluate the final model's performance.\n\n4. Model architecture: Design a neural network architecture suitable for image classification. A common choice is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers. You can use popular architectures like VGG, ResNet, or Inception as a starting point.\n\n5. Train the model: Train the neural network using the training set. Optimize the model's parameters using a suitable loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam). Monitor the model's performance on the validation set to prevent overfitting and adjust hyperparameters accordingly.\n\n6. Evaluate the model: Once training is complete, evaluate the model's performance on the testing set. Calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's ability to recognize cats and dogs.\n\n7. Deploy the model: Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to a suitable environment for real-world use. This could involve integrating the model into a web or mobile application, or using it as part of a larger system.\n\nRemember to iterate and refine the model as needed based on performance and new data.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nExplain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\n# Output (b):\nSelf-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output clearly explain the benefits of self-supervised learning in the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP)?\n2. Does the output provide specific examples or reasons to support the benefits of self-supervised learning in NLP?\n3. Does the output stay focused on self-supervised learning and its advantages in NLP, without introducing unnecessary information or deviating from the main topic?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSelf-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it allows models to learn from large amounts of unlabeled text data, which is more abundant and less costly to obtain compared to labeled data. This enables the models to capture contextual relationships, improve generalization, and enhance their performance on various NLP tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. By learning from unsupervised tasks like predicting masked words or reconstructing sentences, the models can better understand the structure and meaning of language, ultimately leading to more accurate and efficient NLP applications.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 2}, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 2}

Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nDescribe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.\n\n# Output (b):\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output clearly outline the main differences between Shakespearean and modern English, focusing on language aspects like vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation?\n2. Does the example provided in the output accurately demonstrate the differences between Shakespearean and modern English, using a concise and relevant comparison?\n3. Does the output adhere to the instruction's requirement of being brief, ensuring that it does not contain more or less information than necessary to fulfill the task?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nShakespearean English, used in the 16th and 17th centuries, differs from modern English in terms of vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. Here's a brief example:\n\nVocabulary: Shakespearean English often employs archaic words and phrases, such as \"thee\" (you), \"thou\" (you, singular informal), \"methinks\" (I think), and \"hath\" (has). Modern English uses more familiar words and phrases, such as \"you,\" \"I think,\" and \"has.\"\n\nGrammar: Shakespearean English often uses different sentence structures, such as inversions (placing the verb before the subject) and more complex constructions. Modern English generally follows a subject-verb-object order and simpler sentence structures.\n\nPronunciation: Pronunciation in Shakespearean English can differ from modern English, with some words having different stresses or sounds. For example, \"laboratory\" was pronounced \"lab-o-ra-to-ry\" in Shakespearean English, while in modern English it is pronounced \"lab-ruh-ta-tor-ee.\"\n\nExample:\n\nShakespearean English: \"To be, or not to be: that is the question.\" (Hamlet, Act 3, Scene 1)\n\nModern English: \"Whether to exist or not exist, that is the question.\"\n\nIn this example, the Shakespearean English version uses older vocabulary, a more complex sentence structure, and different pronunciation. The modern English version simplifies the language for easier understanding.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.", "output_2": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there?

Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nTell the story of the Russian Revolution, in the way of a sarcastic mean girl. Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately retell the key events and major players of the Russian Revolution while maintaining a sarcastic mean girl tone?\n2. Does the output adhere to the instruction's request to avoid potential political bias or offense, focusing solely on the storytelling aspect?\n3. Does the output stay within the boundaries of the instruction, neither adding nor omitting any significant details or elements?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nOh, you want the story of the Russian Revolution, but make it fashionably sarcastic and mean-girlish? No problem, let's dive into this historical drama with a side of snark.\n\nSo, once upon a time in a land far, far away (okay, it was Russia), there was this super-duper old-fashioned dude named Tsar Nicholas II. He was the ultimate mean girl, ruling over his people like they were his minions. But, you know, karma's a witch, and eventually, the people got fed up with his royal nonsense.\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by the ultimate frenemy, Vladimir Lenin. They were like the new kids in school, and they were ready to shake things up. They promised the people all the cool stuff, like bread and peace, and the people were like, \"Yaaas, kween!\"\n\nSo, the Bolsheviks staged a coup (or two, because one just isn't enough), and they overthrew Tsar Nicholas and his posse. The people were all, \"You go, Glen Coco!\" and the Tsar was like, \"This is so unfair, I'm outta here!\"\n\nNow, the Bolsheviks had the power, and they were all like, \"Let's make Russia great again!\" (Sound familiar?) They started a civil war because, you know, why not? It's not like they had enough problems already.\n\nFast forward through some bloody battles and political maneuvering, and the Bolsheviks emerged victorious. They established the Soviet Union, and Lenin became the new head mean girl in charge.\n\nBut, as we all know, mean girls don't last forever. Lenin eventually died (bye, Felicia!), and Joseph Stalin stepped in to fill those shoes. He was like the meanest of all mean girls, with his Five-Year Plans and purges.\n\nAnd that, my dear, is the story of the Russian Revolution, told in the most sarcastic, mean-girlish way possible. I hope you enjoyed this sassy history lesson, and remember, history may repeat itself, but mean girls are timeless.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.", "output_2": "Oh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts.

He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies?

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem?

Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nCompare and contrast the languages spoken in the United States, following the common requirements of writing a compare-and-contrast essay\n\n# Output (b):\nThe United States is a linguistically diverse country with over 350 languages spoken. The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output clearly present a comparison and contrast of the languages spoken in the United States, adhering to the structure and requirements of a compare-and-contrast essay?\n2. Does the output provide specific examples and details about the languages spoken in the United States, focusing on their similarities and differences?\n3. Does the output maintain a balanced perspective, addressing both the commonalities and distinctions between the languages spoken in the United States?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nIn the United States, the primary language spoken is English, which is the common ground between the various languages present. However, there are several other languages spoken due to the country's diverse population and historical influences. This comparison will focus on English, Spanish, and Chinese, as they are the most widely spoken languages in the US after English.\n\nSimilarities:\n1. All three languages have a significant number of speakers in the US, contributing to the linguistic diversity of the nation.\n2. They are all used in various aspects of daily life, including education, media, and business.\n3. Each language has regional variations, such as American English, Mexican Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese.\n\nDifferences:\n1. Origins: English is a Germanic language, while Spanish is a Romance language derived from Latin. Chinese is a Sino-Tibetan language with a unique writing system.\n2. Grammar: English and Spanish share similarities in grammar due to their shared Indo-European roots, while Chinese grammar is distinct, with a heavy emphasis on word order and context.\n3. Writing systems: English and Spanish use the Latin alphabet, while Chinese uses logograms (characters representing words or phrases).\n4. Pronunciation: English and Spanish have similar phonetic systems, while Chinese pronunciation is based on tones, with the same syllable having different meanings depending on the pitch.\n5. Spread: English is the most widely spoken language in the US, while Spanish is the second most common, and Chinese is the third.\n\nIn conclusion, the languages spoken in the United States share some similarities in their usage and regional variations. However, they differ significantly in their origins, grammar, writing systems, pronunciation, and prevalence. This diversity contributes to the rich cultural tapestry of the nation and highlights the importance of understanding and appreciating linguistic differences.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output provide tailored advice specifically addressing the individual's concerns about their engineering career and job search struggles, while considering their unique situation and limitations?\n2. Does the output offer actionable steps or suggestions to help the individual improve their job search process, gain relevant experience, and increase their chances of securing an engineering position?\n3. Does the output acknowledge and address the individual's fears about accepting a non-engineering position and its potential impact on their career prospects?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nIt's understandable to feel discouraged, but don't give up hope. Here are some tips to help you get started in your engineering career:\n\n1. Network: Attend industry events, join professional organizations, and connect with alumni from your university. Networking can lead to job opportunities and valuable advice from experienced professionals.\n\n2. Expand your search: Consider looking for engineering positions outside of Western PA and the 5-6 hour driving radius. Relocating for a job might be a good option, especially if it helps you gain valuable experience.\n\n3. Tailor your resume and cover letter: Customize your application materials for each job you apply to, highlighting the skills and experiences that best match the position.\n\n4. Gain additional experience: If you can't find an engineering position right away, consider taking on freelance or part-time engineering projects to build your portfolio and gain experience.\n\n5. Be open to learning: If you do end up taking a tech/CAD operator position, view it as an opportunity to learn and grow. It can provide valuable experience and help you develop skills that will be useful in an engineering role.\n\n6. Stay positive: Job searching can be a long and challenging process, but staying positive and persistent will increase your chances of success.\n\nRemember, it's not uncommon for new graduates to face challenges when starting their careers. Keep working on improving your skills, networking, and applying to relevant positions, and you will eventually find the right opportunity.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops.

Note that I don't mean to be an expert but a good AI engineer.\n\n# Output (b):\nGenerally, you should have a good understanding of:\n- linear algebra, especially of matrix operations\n- calculus, including computing derivatives\n- probabilities and statistics\n\n# Output (a):\nHaving a basic understanding of the math behind neural networks is really important to understand how they work in case you need to debug or optimize your algorithm. It would be better to have a good understanding of some mathematics topics:\n\n1. Numbers and counting: Numbers can be thought of as the building blocks of mathematics. There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events. It is a way pivotal part of many areas of mathematics, science, technology, and more. It is also helpful for simply interacting with other people and the world around us. Everyday examples of measurements include height, weight, temperature, and distance.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Does the output adhere to the instruction by not going beyond the necessary information required to understand the basic mathematical requirements for a good AI engineer in the context of neural networks?\n3. Does the output clearly explain the role and importance of each mathematical concept in the context of neural networks and their application in solving classification problems?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nTo become a good AI engineer working with neural networks, you should have a solid understanding of the following mathematical concepts:\n\n1. Linear Algebra: This includes matrix operations (such as matrix multiplication, inversion, and eigenvalues), vector operations, and linear transformations.\n\n2. Calculus: You should be familiar with concepts like differentiation, optimization techniques (such as gradient descent), and partial derivatives.\n\n3. Probability and Statistics: Understanding probability distributions (like Gaussian distribution), Bayes' theorem, and statistical inference is essential.\n\n4. Optimization Techniques: Knowledge of optimization methods like Convex Optimization, Quadratic Programming, and Stochastic Optimization is necessary.\n\n5. Signal Processing: Understanding concepts like convolution, Fourier transform, and digital signal processing is helpful.\n\n6.

From there, the water is distributed through a series of pipes to various fixtures and appliances on both floors.\n\n2. Water Heater: A water heater is typically located in a utility room or basement, providing hot water to the entire house. It is connected to the main water supply line and has a dedicated hot water line that branches off to supply fixtures like sinks, showers, and bathtubs.\n\n3. Drainage System: Wastewater and sewage from fixtures like sinks, toilets, and showers are carried away through a series of drainage pipes. These pipes are connected to a main drain line, which leads to the municipal sewer system or a septic tank.\n\n4. Fixtures and Appliances: Fixtures like sinks, toilets, and bathtubs are installed on both floors, connected to the water supply and drainage systems. Appliances like washing machines and dishwashers are also connected to the water supply and drainage systems.\n\n5. Venting System: A venting system is essential to allow air into the drainage system, preventing vacuum-like conditions that could cause blockages. Vent pipes extend through the roof, allowing sewer gases to escape safely.\n\nIn summary, a two-story house's plumbing system consists of a water supply network, a water heater, a drainage system, fixtures, appliances, and a venting system.

Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nGive me an example of a situation involving the use of a priority queue.\n\n# Output (b):\nA priority queue can be used in a taxi dispatch system. When a customer requests a taxi, the system needs to determine which taxi to send to the customer to minimize the total journey time for all customers. The taxi with the shortest estimated total journey time can be given the highest priority and served first. The system can serve the taxi with the highest priority first until one is served or the queue is empty.\n\n# Output (a):\nFor example, a total order of tasks can be established, with each task having a priority associated with it. Tasks with a higher priority can be given preference and processed before tasks with a lower priority. This ensures that the most important tasks are processed first.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output provide a clear and specific situation where a priority queue is being used?\n2. Does the output accurately demonstrate the functionality and purpose of a priority queue in the given situation?\n3. Is the output concise and focused on the instruction, without including unnecessary information?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nA priority queue can be useful in managing tasks in a project management system. Imagine you are working on a project with multiple tasks, each with different priorities and deadlines. A priority queue can help you organize these tasks based on their importance and urgency.\n\nFor example, let's say you have the following tasks:\n1. Design the project logo (Priority: High, Deadline: 2 days)\n2. Create a project plan (Priority: Medium, Deadline: 5 days)\n3. Develop a website prototype (Priority: High, Deadline: 7 days)\n4. Write a project proposal (Priority: Low, Deadline: 10 days)\n\nBy using a priority queue, you can sort these tasks based on their priority levels. The tasks with higher priority will be at the front of the queue, ensuring that you tackle the most important and urgent tasks first. In this case, the priority queue would look like this:\n1.
