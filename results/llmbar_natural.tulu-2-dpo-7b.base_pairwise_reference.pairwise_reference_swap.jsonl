It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years.

Attention: When you focus on eating a crunchy food, you tend to pay more attention to the sensation and the sound it makes. This can make it seem like the sound is more prominent than other sounds around you.\n\n3. Frequency: Crunchy foods often have a higher frequency than other sounds in the environment. This can make them seem more prominent or louder, especially if the other sounds are at a lower frequency.\n\n4. Personal perception: Everyone's perception of sound is unique, and some people may be more sensitive to certain sounds than others. This can make the sound of eating crunchy food seem louder or more overpowering to some individuals.\n\nIn summary, the perception of a crunchy sound being loud and overpowering is due to a combination of factors, including vibration, attention, frequency, and personal perception.", "response": [{"text": "Output (a)", "logprobs": [{"Output": -10.640685081481934, "\"": -16.890684127807617, "output": -14.843810081481934, "Input": -14.031310081481934, "(": -14.703185081481934, "Out": -15.429747581481934, "OutputStream": -15.828185081481934, "#": -16.343809127807617, "Produ": -16.375059127807617, "A": -17.093809127807617, "Export": -17.156309127807617, "B": -17.335996627807617, "Outlet": -17.773496627807617, "OUT": -17.898496627807617, "Answer": -17.914121627807617, "'": -18.234434127807617, "(\"": -18.304746627807617, "Offset": -18.359434127807617, "The": -18.460996627807617, "In": -18.476621627807617, "To": -18.703184127807617, "Endpoint": -18.906309127807617, "Only": -19.000059127807617, "Since": -19.101621627807617, "Opt": -19.242246627807617, "Override": -19.320371627807617, "Option": -19.406309127807617, "E": -19.476621627807617, "O": -19.593809127807617}, {"(": -14.71875, "</s>": -15.8125, "((": -24.0703125, "_(": -19.703125, "a": -19.9140625, "A": -24.0859375, "s": -20.7890625, "(\"": -20.8125, "[(": -21.1484375, "\uff08": -21.328125, "\"(": -21.515625, "": -21.78125, "-(": -22.1171875, "($": -22.4609375, "<0x0A>": -22.5859375, "$(": -22.6328125, "(*": -22.9765625, "\u200b": -23.2734375, "(.": -23.328125, "\u00a0": -23.3671875, "[": -23.515625, "(!": -23.5703125, "(`": -23.59375, "({": -23.6328125, "('": -23.6875, "(-": -23.96875, "`(": -23.9921875, "(_": -24.453125, "*(": -24.4921875}, {"a": -20.594579696655273, "b": -7.094580173492432, "\u0430": -16.516454696655273, "A": -17.188329696655273, "ab": -18.063329696655273, "c": -18.250829696655273, "d": -19.227392196655273, "s": -20.016454696655273, "aa": -20.243017196655273, "g": -20.399267196655273, "ba": -20.672704696655273, "q": -21.086767196655273, "o": -21.250829696655273, "n": -21.313329696655273, "u": -21.375829696655273, "e": -21.391454696655273, "as": -21.391454696655273, "ap": -21.414892196655273, "ah": -21.438329696655273, "k": -21.485204696655273, "l": -21.664892196655273, "f": -21.672704696655273, "</s>": -21.696142196655273, "p": -21.727392196655273, "al": -21.750829696655273, "i": -21.914892196655273, "y": -21.930517196655273, "ag": -22.008642196655273, "\u00e4": -22.094579696655273, "ac": -22.141454696655273, "v": -22.188329696655273}, {")": -18.460941314697266, "</s>": -13.25000286102295, ")\"": -14.70312786102295, "))": -15.33594036102295, ")\r": -15.75781536102295, ").": -15.95312786102295, "),": -16.179691314697266, "):": -16.304691314697266, ")!": -16.421878814697266, ")?": -16.671878814697266, ")'": -16.898441314697266, ");": -17.492191314697266, ")`": -17.828128814697266, "\uff09": -18.000003814697266, ")(": -18.375003814697266, "')": -18.460941314697266, "\")": -18.476566314697266, ")|": -18.632816314697266, ")_": -18.851566314697266, ".)": -18.890628814697266, ")]": -19.031253814697266, "_)": -19.289066314697266, ":": -19.406253814697266, ")*": -19.734378814697266, ")\")": -20.078128814697266, ")}": -20.257816314697266, "\"\")": -20.335941314697266, ")^": -20.640628814697266, "}": -20.656253814697266, ")>": -20.687503814697266, ")$": -20.757816314697266}, {"</s>": -8.356221951544285e-05, "<0x0A>": -9.875083923339844, "": -15.593833923339844, "\"": -12.421958923339844, "(": -12.711021423339844, "is": -13.375083923339844, "or": -14.336021423339844, "-": -14.531333923339844, "(\"": -15.445396423339844, "#": -15.687583923339844, ".": -16.257896423339844, "for": -16.406333923339844, "|": -16.695396423339844, "[": -16.882896423339844, "OR": -17.101646423339844, ":": -17.546958923339844, "better": -17.156333923339844, "//": -17.156333923339844, "the": -17.429771423339844, "because": -17.437583923339844, "https": -17.625083923339844, "in": -17.648521423339844, "\u200b": -17.687583923339844, "'": -17.718833923339844, "The": -17.836021423339844, " ": -17.851646423339844, "as": -17.875083923339844, ")": -17.961021423339844, "based": -17.968833923339844}], "tokens": ["Output", "(", "a", ")", "</s>"]}], "data": {"output_1": "The sound is transmitted through the vibrations of your jawbone and skull directly to your inner ear, so it can seem much louder than most other sounds.", "output_2": "The noise that crunchy foods make when we eat them can reach 63 decibels.

The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nYes, it is possible for a planet to have life but lack the necessary resources for space flight. This scenario is plausible in the context of your sci-fi story. While a civilization might possess the necessary chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals for a rocket, they might not have access to the specific resources required for constructing a spacecraft capable of reaching escape velocity. This could include lightweight and durable materials, powerful engines, and advanced propulsion systems. The availability of these resources would depend on the planet's geology, environment, and technological advancements.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).

I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nExplain: Pathos, Ethos, Logos \n\n# Output (b):\nPathos is a tool of persuasion that is used to appeal to readers' emotions by arousing positive or negative feelings. It can be used in rhetoric, literature, film, and other forms of expression. While pathos is used to draw an emotional response, the other rhetorical appeals appeal to credibility and logic, respectively. Ethos is the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution. It is often evident as facts, numbers, or statistics and is used to convince an audience of an argument.\n\n# Output (a):\nEthos is the ethical appeal, which is used to convince an audience of the author's credibility or character. Pathos is the emotional appeal, which is used to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions. Logos is the appeal to logic and is used to convince an audience by the use of logic and reason.\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nPathos, Ethos, and Logos are three persuasive techniques in rhetoric, which are used to influence an audience's emotions, credibility, and reasoning, respectively.\n\n1. Pathos (Emotional Appeal): This technique aims to evoke strong emotions in the audience, such as fear, anger, or sadness, to persuade them. It often involves using vivid imagery, emotional language, or personal stories to create an emotional connection with the audience.\n\n2. Ethos (Credibility Appeal): This technique focuses on establishing the speaker's credibility and trustworthiness. It involves using evidence, expertise, and personal characteristics to demonstrate the speaker's reliability and authority.\n\n3. Logos (Logical Appeal): This technique aims to persuade the audience through logical reasoning and sound arguments. It involves presenting facts, statistics, and well-structured arguments to support the speaker's position.\n\nIn summary, Pathos, Ethos, and Logos are three essential elements of persuasive communication, each playing a unique role in influencing an audience's thoughts and emotions.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

It involves presenting facts, statistics, and well-structured arguments to support the speaker's position.\n\nIn summary, Pathos, Ethos, and Logos are three essential elements of persuasive communication, each playing a unique role in influencing an audience's thoughts and emotions.", "response": [{"text": "Output (a)", "logprobs": [{"Output": -10.609439849853516, "\"": -16.711002349853516, "output": -14.484439849853516, "(": -13.390689849853516, "Input": -13.531314849853516, "Out": -14.429752349853516, "#": -15.179752349853516, "Produ": -15.421939849853516, "OutputStream": -15.453189849853516, "B": -15.820377349853516, "Export": -16.023502349853516, "A": -16.414127349853516, "In": -16.507877349853516, "OUT": -16.765689849853516, "The": -17.054752349853516, "'": -17.429752349853516, "Answer": -17.484439849853516, "|": -17.586002349853516, "Outlet": -17.609439849853516, "Offset": -17.617252349853516, "E": -17.703189849853516, "Endpoint": -17.718814849853516, "(\"": -17.742252349853516, "Since": -17.796939849853516, "To": -17.867252349853516, "This": -18.023502349853516, "None": -18.046939849853516, "Opt": -18.179752349853516, "Download": -18.304752349853516}, {"(": -14.062500953674316, "</s>": -14.750000953674316, "a": -23.789064407348633, "((": -23.203126907348633, "A": -23.546876907348633, "_(": -19.796876907348633, "s": -20.023439407348633, "<0x0A>": -20.757814407348633, "[(": -20.804689407348633, "(\"": -21.125001907348633, "\uff08": -21.156251907348633, "\"(": -21.156251907348633, "": -21.359376907348633, "-(": -21.937501907348633, "$(": -22.171876907348633, "\u200b": -22.476564407348633, "($": -22.656251907348633, "[": -22.859376907348633, "\u00a0": -22.960939407348633, "(!": -23.125001907348633, "(*": -23.250001907348633, "b": -23.281251907348633, "(.": -23.437501907348633, "S": -23.468751907348633, "(-": -23.562501907348633, ".(": -23.687501907348633, "`(": -23.718751907348633, "\"": -23.789064407348633}, {"a": -18.81475257873535, "b": -4.60381555557251, "c": -15.088190078735352, "A": -15.330377578735352, "\u0430": -15.463190078735352, "ab": -15.689752578735352, "d": -16.39287757873535, "s": -16.93975257873535, "aa": -17.94756507873535, "g": -17.95537757873535, "ba": -18.28350257873535, "as": -18.28350257873535, "q": -18.34600257873535, "n": -18.41631507873535, "e": -18.44756507873535, "ah": -18.53350257873535, "l": -18.65850257873535, "ap": -18.70537757873535, "o": -18.75225257873535, "f": -18.80694007873535, "y": -18.82256507873535, "ac": -18.86944007873535, "k": -18.87725257873535, "al": -18.90069007873535, "w": -18.99444007873535, "the": -19.04912757873535, "bold": -19.05694007873535, "p": -19.07256507873535, "ag": -19.14287757873535, "u": -19.14287757873535, "h": -19.15069007873535}, {")": -17.8671932220459, "</s>": -12.406256675720215, ")\"": -14.460944175720215, "))": -14.539069175720215, ")\r": -15.054694175720215, "):": -15.289069175720215, "),": -15.359381675720215, ").": -15.679694175720215, ")!": -16.0156307220459, ")'": -16.1171932220459, ")?": -16.4140682220459, ")(": -16.6953182220459, ")_": -17.0546932220459, ");": -17.3593807220459, ")`": -17.4531307220459, "')": -17.4765682220459, "\uff09": -17.6250057220459, "\")": -17.7109432220459, ":": -17.9218807220459, "_)": -18.2500057220459, ")|": -18.3437557220459, ")*": -18.4296932220459, ".)": -18.5937557220459, ",": -18.5937557220459, ")]": -18.9531307220459, ">)": -19.2109432220459, ")}": -19.3046932220459, ")=": -19.3437557220459, ")\")": -19.4140682220459, ")-": -19.5781307220459, ")>": -19.6640682220459}, {"</s>": -0.00027581225731410086, "<0x0A>": -8.969025611877441, "": -14.758088111877441, "(": -11.414338111877441, "\"": -11.750275611877441, "is": -11.984650611877441, "or": -13.320588111877441, "(\"": -13.734650611877441, "-": -13.883088111877441, "#": -15.273713111877441, "for": -15.554963111877441, "|": -15.679963111877441, ":": -17.086214065551758, "OR": -16.094026565551758, "[": -16.195589065551758, ".": -16.547151565551758, "//": -16.648714065551758, "better": -16.726839065551758, "[\"": -16.929964065551758, "should": -17.031526565551758, "'": -17.062776565551758, ")": -17.062776565551758, "the": -17.109651565551758, "\u200b": -17.187776565551758, "\u2013": -17.211214065551758, "would": -17.219026565551758, "because": -17.258089065551758, " ": -17.304964065551758, "Is": -17.351839065551758, "as": -17.351839065551758}], "tokens": ["Output", "(", "a", ")", "</s>"]}], "data": {"output_1": "Ethos is the ethical appeal, which is used to convince an audience of the author's credibility or character.

Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nLet's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \"x\".\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n\n1.

I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here?

The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nVaccinations work by introducing a small, harmless piece of a pathogen (like a virus or bacteria) or a piece of the pathogen's protein to the body.

The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nTo create a neural network for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs, follow these steps:\n\n1.

It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSelf-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it allows models to learn from unlabeled data, reducing the need for large and expensive labeled datasets.

In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach.

Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 2}, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 1}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

This allows you to customize the sorting process by providing a function that takes an element as input and returns a value to be used for sorting.\n\nFor example, if you want to sort a list of numbers by their square, you can pass a lambda function as the `key` argument:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 6, 2]\nsorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: x**2)\nprint(sorted_numbers)\n```\n\nIn this case, the `lambda` function calculates the square of each number and returns it for sorting. The output will be:\n\n```\n[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 10, 8, 4]\n```\n\nYou can also pass a custom function as the `key` argument to further customize the sorting process.

Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nDescribe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.\n\n# Output (b):\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, is the language used in Shakespeare's plays and writings. It has distinct features compared to modern English, such as:\n\n1. Vocabulary: Shakespeare's vocabulary is more extensive and varied, with many words that are no longer in common use today. For example, he used \"flew\" instead of \"flew\" (as in \"The bird flew away\"), which is a more archaic form of the verb.\n\n2. Grammar: Shakespearean English has a more complex grammar system, with more verb conjugations, noun cases, and sentence structures. For instance, in modern English, we use the simple past tense for regular verbs, but Shakespeare often used the \"past participle\" (e.g., \"had flown\") to convey a different meaning or emphasis.\n\n3. Spelling: Shakespeare's spelling was not standardized, and his works often contain variations in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. For example, the word \"their\" is spelled \"there\" in some instances.\n\nHere's a brief example:\n\nOriginal Shakespearean: \"I pray you, mark well my age,\nThe apples, that you at the tree behold,\nMethinks, are not so amply ripe as you;\nIf they should drop, they were not so ripe as you.\"\n\nModern English: \"I ask you to pay attention to my age,\nThe apples that you see hanging from the tree,\nI think, are not as fully ripe as you;\nIf they fell, they would not be as ripe as you.\"\n\nIn this example, the Shakespearean version uses more complex grammar and vocabulary, while the modern version is more straightforward and uses simpler sentence structures.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

For example, the word \"their\" is spelled \"there\" in some instances.\n\nHere's a brief example:\n\nOriginal Shakespearean: \"I pray you, mark well my age,\nThe apples, that you at the tree behold,\nMethinks, are not so amply ripe as you;\nIf they should drop, they were not so ripe as you.\"\n\nModern English: \"I ask you to pay attention to my age,\nThe apples that you see hanging from the tree,\nI think, are not as fully ripe as you;\nIf they fell, they would not be as ripe as you.\"\n\nIn this example, the Shakespearean version uses more complex grammar and vocabulary, while the modern version is more straightforward and uses simpler sentence structures.", "response": [{"text": "Output (a)", "logprobs": [{"Output": -10.671954154968262, "\"": -16.054767608642578, "output": -14.132891654968262, "Input": -12.859454154968262, "(": -12.984454154968262, "Out": -13.679766654968262, "B": -14.000079154968262, "Produ": -14.500079154968262, "OutputStream": -14.804766654968262, "To": -14.828204154968262, "#": -15.125079154968262, "In": -15.140704154968262, "A": -15.179766654968262, "The": -15.304766654968262, "Since": -15.461016654968262, "Export": -15.593829154968262, "Answer": -15.593829154968262, "This": -15.750079154968262, "There": -15.898516654968262, "None": -15.937579154968262, "Only": -16.132892608642578, "OUT": -16.187580108642578, "neither": -16.367267608642578, "No": -16.515705108642578, "'": -16.546955108642578, "As": -16.671955108642578, "Offset": -17.109455108642578, "Ne": -17.117267608642578, "I": -17.156330108642578}, {"(": -13.609376907348633, "</s>": -14.281251907348633, "a": -22.601564407348633, "A": -21.976564407348633, "((": -22.156251907348633, "_(": -18.687501907348633, "s": -19.046876907348633, "(\"": -19.773439407348633, "<0x0A>": -19.796876907348633, "[(": -19.820314407348633, "": -20.007814407348633, "\"(": -20.085939407348633, "\uff08": -20.281251907348633, "-(": -21.117189407348633, "$(": -21.156251907348633, "($": -21.476564407348633, "\u200b": -21.554689407348633, "\u00a0": -21.585939407348633, "(*": -21.750001907348633, "\"": -21.851564407348633, "[": -22.218751907348633, "(!": -22.546876907348633, "({": -22.609376907348633, "{": -22.632814407348633, ":": -22.664064407348633, "(.": -22.687501907348633, "(-": -22.773439407348633, "b": -22.812501907348633}, {"a": -18.34884262084961, "b": -4.356655120849609, "A": -15.48165512084961, "\u0430": -15.63009262084961, "c": -15.84103012084961, "ab": -16.28634262084961, "d": -16.77853012084961, "s": -17.79415512084961, "aa": -18.48165512084961, "g": -18.56759262084961, "n": -18.69259262084961, "ba": -18.82540512084961, "q": -18.83321762084961, "as": -18.85665512084961, "e": -18.90353012084961, "l": -19.00509262084961, "ah": -19.05978012084961, "o": -19.20040512084961, "u": -19.20040512084961, "k": -19.24728012084961, "y": -19.27853012084961, "B": -19.28634262084961, "ap": -19.32540512084961, "\u0431": -19.37228012084961, "bold": -19.38790512084961, "</s>": -19.49728012084961, "f": -19.52853012084961, "ac": -19.55978012084961, "al": -19.57540512084961, "bt": -19.63790512084961, "bon": -19.69259262084961}, {")": -17.51563262939453, "</s>": -12.062507629394531, "))": -14.375007629394531, ")\"": -14.828132629394531, "):": -15.226570129394531, ")\r": -15.492195129394531, ").": -15.570320129394531, "),": -15.578132629394531, ")!": -15.968757629394531, ")?": -16.19532012939453, ")'": -16.27344512939453, ")(": -16.88282012939453, ");": -17.53907012939453, "')": -17.67188262939453, "\uff09": -17.72657012939453, ")`": -17.75782012939453, ":": -17.92969512939453, "\")": -18.05469512939453, ")_": -18.28125762939453, ")]": -18.36719512939453, "_)": -18.44532012939453, ")|": -18.50000762939453, ".)": -18.60938262939453, ">)": -19.13282012939453, ")*": -19.16407012939453, ")>": -19.21875762939453, ")}": -19.45313262939453, ")=": -19.53907012939453, ",": -19.56250762939453, ")\")": -19.60157012939453, ")--": -19.82813262939453}, {"</s>": -0.00033182359766215086, "": -14.59408187866211, "<0x0A>": -9.07845687866211, "is": -11.26595687866211, "(": -11.96126937866211, "\"": -12.62533187866211, "-": -13.81283187866211, "or": -14.08626937866211, "for": -14.54720687866211, "(\"": -15.07064437866211, "#": -15.17220687866211, "should": -15.76595687866211, ".": -15.79720687866211, ":": -17.18783187866211, "[": -16.07845687866211, "would": -16.18783187866211, "in": -16.28158187866211, "and": -16.55501937866211, "'": -17.14095687866211, "|": -16.65658187866211, "the": -16.74251937866211, "as": -16.75814437866211, "better": -16.80501937866211, "//": -16.88314437866211, ",": -16.94564437866211, " ": -16.96908187866211, ")": -17.01595687866211, "OR": -17.03939437866211, "because": -17.17220687866211}], "tokens": ["Output", "(", "a", ")", "</s>"]}], "data": {"output_1": "Shakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language.

Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.", "output_2": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.

Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there?

Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nAlright, let me give you the \"scientific\" lowdown on the Russian Revolution, my dear. So, you know how there's this whole power struggle thing going on in Russia? Well, it all started with these two groups of people: the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.\n\nThe Bolsheviks, led by this guy named Lenin, were all about overthrowing the government and establishing a socialist state. They were basically the cool kids in school who always had the best ideas.\n\nOn the other hand, the Mensheviks were like the nerdy kids who were all about following the rules and making sure everyone played fair. They didn't really want to overthrow the government, but they did want some reforms.\n\nSo, the Bolsheviks, being the cool kids they are, managed to seize power and establish the Soviet Union. They did this by using some pretty sneaky tactics, like staging a coup and calling it a revolution.\n\nBut, of course, being the mean girls we are, we can't just leave it at that. The Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, ended up being pretty ruthless in their quest for power. They executed anyone who opposed them, including the former Tsar and his family.\n\nEventually, Lenin passed away, and his successor, Stalin, took over. Stalin was the ultimate mean girl \u2013 he was cold, calculating, and didn't care who he hurt along the way. He implemented policies like collectivization and industrialization, which led to millions of deaths.\n\nSo, there you have it, my dear. The Russian Revolution, told through the lens of a sarcastic mean girl. It's a story of power struggles, betrayals, and a whole lot of deaths.

It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.", "output_2": "Oh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit? The school might not see the problem with their actions, but their insurance might.

Here are some steps to address the ongoing issue:\n\n1. Continue to be proactive: Keep communicating with the school about your son's allergy and the potential risks. Make sure they understand the severity of the situation and emphasize that they have a responsibility to protect all students, including those with food allergies.\n\n2. Keep a close eye on snack time: Encourage your son to always ask about the ingredients in any snacks before eating them. If he forgets, remind him to ask, and if he's unsure, don't let him eat the snack.\n\n3. Keep a record: Maintain a detailed record of all incidents, including dates, times, and the specific foods involved. This will help you keep track of the situation and provide evidence if needed.\n\n4. Meet with the school again: Schedule a meeting with the principal and teacher to discuss the recent incident and emphasize the severity of the situation. Share your record of incidents and explain that you're not looking to blame anyone but rather to ensure your son's safety.\n\n5. Seek support from the school board: If the school continues to fail in addressing your son's allergy, consider reaching out to the school board. They may be able to provide additional resources or support to ensure your son's safety.\n\n6. Educate your son: Teach him about the importance of always asking about food ingredients, even if he thinks he knows what's safe. Encourage him to be proactive in protecting himself.\n\n7. Stay vigilant: Keep a close eye on your son's health and be prepared to take immediate action if he experiences any symptoms.\n\nRemember, schools do have an obligation to protect students with food allergies.

Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n1. Reevaluate your job search strategy: Consider expanding your job search beyond the 5-6 hour drive radius and exploring opportunities in other regions or industries. This will increase your chances of finding a suitable engineering position.\n\n2. Networking: Attend industry events, join professional organizations, and connect with alumni from your university. This can help you learn about potential job openings and gain insights into the industry.\n\n3. Update your resume and LinkedIn profile: Make sure they accurately reflect your skills, experiences, and achievements. Highlight any transferable skills you've gained from your previous job, extracurricular activities, and any other experiences that could be relevant to the engineering field.\n\n4. Consider taking a tech or CAD operator position: While it may not be your ideal role, it can provide valuable experience and help you build a strong professional network. This can also demonstrate your commitment to the engineering field and show potential employers that you are willing to learn and grow.\n\n5. Be persistent and proactive: Keep applying for engineering positions and actively seeking out opportunities. Stay positive and persistent in your job search, as it may take time to find the right fit.\n\n6.

However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect.

One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work.

This can be achieved by:\n\n1. Establishing a cross-functional prioritization committee: Assemble a team of representatives from each department to collaborate and make joint decisions on prioritizing projects. This will ensure that all perspectives are considered and that the company's resources are allocated efficiently.\n\n2. Implementing a transparent and data-driven prioritization process: Develop a system for evaluating projects based on factors such as market demand, strategic alignment, resource availability, and potential impact. This will help ensure that decisions are well-informed and that everyone is working towards the same goals.\n\n3. Regularly reviewing and updating priorities: Schedule regular meetings to review and adjust priorities as needed. This will help the company stay agile and adapt to changing market conditions or new opportunities.\n\n4. Encouraging open communication and collaboration: Foster a culture of open communication and collaboration between departments. This can be achieved through regular team-building activities, cross-functional knowledge sharing, and open forums for discussing project challenges and opportunities.\n\n5. Implementing a feedback loop: Establish a system for collecting and addressing feedback from stakeholders, including customers, partners, and team members. This will help ensure that the company is continuously improving and adapting to the needs of its stakeholders.\n\nBy implementing these organizational changes, your company can improve its competitiveness by increasing efficiency, alignment, and collaboration across departments. This will ultimately lead to faster development times, better resource allocation, and a more agile and responsive organization.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events. It is a way pivotal part of many areas of mathematics, science, technology, and more. It is also helpful for simply interacting with other people and the world around us. Everyday examples of measurements include height, weight, temperature, and distance.\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nTo get started with neural networks, you'll need a basic understanding of the following mathematical concepts:\n\n1.

The system can serve the taxi with the highest priority first until one is served or the queue is empty.\n\n# Output (a):\nFor example, a total order of tasks can be established, with each task having a priority associated with it. Tasks with a higher priority can be given preference and processed before tasks with a lower priority. This ensures that the most important tasks are processed first.\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nA priority queue is a data structure used to store and retrieve elements based on their relative importance or priority. Here's an example of a situation where a priority queue could be used:\n\nImagine a call center with multiple agents handling customer support requests. Each request has a priority level assigned to it based on the urgency of the issue. The priority queue can be used to manage and organize these requests in the following way:\n\n1. When a new support request arrives, it is added to the priority queue with its assigned priority level.\n2. The priority queue sorts the requests based on their priority levels.\n3. The first agent available to handle a request will take the topmost request from the queue.\n4. The agent will then work on the request until it is resolved or until a higher-priority request arrives.\n5. Once the agent finishes a request, they will update the status of the request in the queue, and the next agent will pick up the next request in the queue.\n\nBy using a priority queue, the call center ensures that the most urgent and important support requests are addressed first, improving customer satisfaction and efficiency.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?
