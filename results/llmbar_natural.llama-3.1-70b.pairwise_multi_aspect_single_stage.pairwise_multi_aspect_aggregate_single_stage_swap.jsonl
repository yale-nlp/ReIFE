{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\nHer visa to stay here is coming to an end later this year, then she will be forced to return to Malaysia despite opting to stay here if she had the choice. We have gone down the job route, to the point that she was offered the job here, but the employer failed to get a license to issue Visas on very petty grounds.\nI (and others) have suggested getting married. It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years. We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\n\n# Output (a):\nMy girlfriend's visa to stay in the UK expires in a few months, and she wants to stay here, but she won't get married until she goes back to Malaysia.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?", "winner": 1, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

He prepared for his forecast. He expected the forecast would be wrong. Yet when the forecast report came back positive!\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

The sentences seem unrelated to each other, and the text does not make sense in the context of the given first sentence.\n\n2.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Any integer smaller than -4 or larger than 4 will violate the inequality. Therefore, there are a total of 9 integers that satisfy |x + 10| < 5.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe inequality |x + 5| < 10 means that the absolute value of x + 5 is less than 10.\nSince the absolute value is always non-negative, this is equivalent to -10 < x + 5 < 10.\nSubtracting 5 from all parts, we get -15 < x < 5.\nTherefore, the solution set contains all integers between -15 and 5, exclusive. \nThere are 5 - (-15) - 1 = 19 integers in the solution set.\n\nSo the number of integers in the solution is 19\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a detailed explanation of the solution, including the steps to solve the inequality. Output (b) only provides the list of integers that satisfy the inequality and a brief explanation.\n\n3.

However, Output (b) contains an error in its explanation.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (a) is more accurate, provides a more detailed explanation, and follows the instruction more closely.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Humans love crunchy, noisy snacks, and the noise can help us identify what we are eating. The noise draws attention to the mouth and makes us concentrate on what we are eating. This can also influence how much we consume.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe sound is transmitted through the vibrations of your jawbone and skull directly to your inner ear, so it can seem much louder than most other sounds.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is concise and well-structured, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. Output (b) is also well-structured, but it contains a few more sentences, which makes it slightly less concise. However, both outputs are free of spelling and grammatical errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more information about the noise level of crunchy foods and how it affects our eating experience. It also provides some additional insights into human behavior and consumption. Output (a), on the other hand, provides a more direct and scientific explanation for why crunchy foods sound loud, but it lacks additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not highly applicable. However, Output (b) does provide some relevant information and insights that might be useful to the user, while Output (a) sticks to a more direct answer.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs seem to be accurate, but Output (a) provides a more specific and scientific explanation for why crunchy foods sound loud. Output (b) provides some general information about noise levels, but it is not as specific or detailed.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction and provide an answer to the question. However, Output (a) provides a more direct and concise answer, while Output (b) provides some additional information that might not be directly relevant to the question.\n\nOverall, while Output (b) provides more information and insights, Output (a) provides a more direct, concise, and scientifically accurate explanation for why crunchy foods sound loud.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

I'm all for texting with people about small stuff, but having a conversation via text is difficult. It's impossible to say everything you want to say without writing an essay and there is tons of room for miscommunication. I find that the conversation are very superficial when texting. Mostly they go like \"Hey\" \"How are you what are you doing\" etc. I'm getting bored with superficial talk. I crave more deeper and intellectually stimulating conversations. He says he hates talk on the phone and when I call him, he has nothing to say and sounds bored. I offered to video chat or something, but he doesn't want to try. \nWe don't see each other often, so we end up going long periods of time without seeing or hearing each other, only texting. I feel no connection when we text. He sees no problem with this. Am I wrong to be annoyed?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend only likes to text me for shallow conversation. I want deeper and intellectually stimulating conversations. Am I wrong to be annoyed?\n\n# Output (a):\nBoyfriend only likes to talk through text. He sees no issue with it. Am I wrong to be annoyed by this?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

The next week, the other kids were transferred to the store. We were all the best we had ever washed the car.\n\n# Output (a):\nMy wife felt very down so I started to play a game. She ended up making a lot of friends on the bench. She had a big smile on her face to show her appreciation. I had fun that day.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors, making it easy to read and understand. In contrast, Output (b) contains several errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and unclear sentence structures, which make it difficult to follow.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a clear and coherent continuation of the story, adding details about the wife's emotions and the husband's actions. Output (b), on the other hand, seems unrelated to the initial sentence and lacks any meaningful connection to the story.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to complete a brief story, and Output (a) successfully infers this intention by providing a logical and engaging continuation. Output (b) fails to understand the user's intention, providing an unrelated and confusing passage.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) does not contain any factual errors, while Output (b) is filled with nonsensical statements that are not grounded in reality.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction to complete the story, while Output (b) fails to do so, providing an unrelated passage instead.\n\nOverall, Output (a) excels in all aspects, providing a well-structured, coherent, and engaging continuation of the story. Output (b), on the other hand, is marred by errors, lacks relevance, and fails to understand the user's intention.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I am looking to write a sci-fi story. The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

Output (b) is also well-structured and error-free, but its tone is more technical and may be less accessible to a non-expert audience.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more detailed and technical information about the gravitational potential well and how it affects the feasibility of space flight. Output (a) provides more general and speculative information about the possibilities of a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) does a better job of inferring the user's intention and providing relevant information for a sci-fi story. Output (b) focuses more on the technical aspects of space flight and may not be as directly applicable to the user's story.\n\n4.

Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her? Again, sorry for my bad english =/\n\n# Output (b):\nI want to give some advice to my 17-year-old sister to avoid risky situations while drunk, without instilling rape fear or guilt in her. How would you advise me to phrase my advice?\n\n# Output (a):\nI want to tell my sister that she should avoid getting drunk with people she doesn't know or trust to avoid drowning risk, but I also want to make her aware that rape fear is a serious issue.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) better captures the user's intention of wanting to advise their sister on how to avoid risky situations while drunk, without instilling fear or guilt. Output (b) partially captures the intention but lacks specificity.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in conveying the user's concerns, but Output (a) is more comprehensive in covering the two main risks mentioned in the original content.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) better follows the instruction to summarize the content, as it provides a concise summary of the main points. Output (b) is too brief and does not fully capture the essence of the original content.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (a) is more comprehensive, coherent, and accurately conveys the user's concerns, making it a better summary of the original content.

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nExplain: Pathos, Ethos, Logos \n\n# Output (b):\nPathos is a tool of persuasion that is used to appeal to readers' emotions by arousing positive or negative feelings. It can be used in rhetoric, literature, film, and other forms of expression. While pathos is used to draw an emotional response, the other rhetorical appeals appeal to credibility and logic, respectively. Ethos is the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution. It is often evident as facts, numbers, or statistics and is used to convince an audience of an argument.\n\n# Output (a):\nEthos is the ethical appeal, which is used to convince an audience of the author's credibility or character. Pathos is the emotional appeal, which is used to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions. Logos is the appeal to logic and is used to convince an audience by the use of logic and reason.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is concise and well-structured, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. Output (b) is also well-structured, but it contains a few unnecessary words and phrases, such as \"While pathos is used to draw an emotional response, the other rhetorical appeals appeal to credibility and logic, respectively.\" which makes the text slightly less concise.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more detailed information about pathos and ethos, including examples of how ethos can be evident as facts, numbers, or statistics. Output (a) provides a brief definition of each term, but lacks additional information or examples.\n\n3.

Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their definitions of pathos, ethos, and logos.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) provides a definition of all three terms (pathos, ethos, and logos), while Output (b) only provides a definition of pathos and ethos, and mentions logos briefly, but does not provide a clear definition.\n\nOutput (a) is more concise and provides a clear definition of all three terms, while Output (b) provides more detailed information about pathos and ethos, but lacks a clear definition of logos.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

At the first bus stop, half of the people got down and 4 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal? \n\n# Output (b):\nLet's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. \n\nAt the first stop, half of the people got down, so there were x/2 people left on the bus. Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed information about the story, such as the storm and the actions taken to clean up the puddle. Output (b) does not provide much relevant information to the story, and seems to be unrelated to the first sentence.\n\n3.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here? I don't really know anything about finance, or what's actually going on. I really want to help my parents, but at the same time I have to protect myself too.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy mom asked me to hide her \u20ac12,000 savings from the bank so that the bank doesn't know about it. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Output (a):\nI'm a student in Ireland. I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster. Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is clear and concise, but it contains a somewhat confrontational tone and a dismissive statement about IT. Output (b) is also clear, but it is more personal and anecdotal, which may make it more relatable and engaging.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more specific and detailed information about the speaker's experience with an engineering physics degree, including their current research and the employment prospects of their peers. Output (a) provides more general advice and encouragement, but it lacks specific examples or details.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) seems to understand the user's desire to pursue physics, but it also makes an assumption about the user's career goals and priorities. Output (b) takes a more nuanced approach, sharing the speaker's personal experience and highlighting the potential benefits of combining physics and engineering.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs contain accurate information, but Output (a) makes a somewhat sweeping statement about the relative salaries and job prospects of physicists, engineers, and IT professionals. Output (b) is more careful in its claims, focusing on the speaker's personal experience and the specific field of engineering physics.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) directly addresses the user's question and provides advice, but it also goes somewhat off-topic in its discussion of salaries and job prospects. Output (b) takes a more indirect approach, sharing the speaker's personal experience and highlighting the potential benefits of combining physics and engineering, but it ultimately provides a more thoughtful and relevant response.\n\nOverall, while both outputs have their strengths and weaknesses, Output (b) provides a more thoughtful and relevant response to the user's question. It shares the speaker's personal experience, highlights the potential benefits of combining physics and engineering, and provides more specific and detailed information about the field of engineering physics. Output (a) is more direct and encouraging, but it also contains some assumptions and sweeping statements that may not be entirely accurate or relevant.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.",

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nHow do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity? \n\n# Output (b):\nVaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of a virus or bacteria, or parts of its structure such as proteins, into a person's body. The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (b) provides a more detailed and coherent explanation of how vaccinations work, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. Output (a) is more concise but still clear and easy to understand.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more detailed information about the immune system's response to vaccinations, including the production of antibodies and memory cells. Output (a) provides a more general overview of how vaccinations work and the concept of herd immunity.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable. However, both outputs provide relevant information and address the user's questions.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs provide accurate information about vaccinations and herd immunity. However, Output (b) provides more specific details about the immune system's response, which suggests a higher level of accuracy.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs address the user's questions and provide information about vaccinations and herd immunity. However, Output (b) provides a more comprehensive explanation of how vaccinations work, which suggests a higher level of completeness.\n\nOverall, while both outputs are clear and accurate, Output (b) provides more detailed and comprehensive information about vaccinations and herd immunity. Output (b) also provides a more detailed explanation of the immune system's response, which suggests a higher level of accuracy and completeness. Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -0.039752278476953506}, {".": -3.576278118089249e-07}, {" Text": -4.172316494077677e-06}, {" Quality": -1.1920928244535389e-07}, {":\n":

Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems.

These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I come from a long line of warriors who have fought to defend this kingdom for generations. I am honored to be here today, in the presence of such an esteemed company, and I hope to earn your trust and respect with my deeds and actions.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) and Output (b) both demonstrate excellent text quality, with well-structured sentences, proper grammar, and no spelling errors. However, Output (a) uses more formal and elaborate language, which is fitting for a medieval knight's introduction at a royal banquet. Output (b) is also well-written, but its tone is slightly less formal.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed information about the knight's identity, including their name, monarch, and kingdom, which adds to the richness of the introduction. Output (b) provides a more general introduction, focusing on the knight's humility and loyalty, but lacks specific details.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not highly relevant in this case. However, Output (a) seems to better understand the tone and style expected of a medieval knight's introduction, while Output (b) takes a more humble and general approach.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their portrayal of a medieval knight's introduction, but Output (a) is more precise in its language and details, which suggests a deeper understanding of the medieval knight's code of conduct.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to introduce themselves in the tone of a medieval knight at a royal banquet. However, Output (a) provides a more complete introduction, including the knight's name, monarch, and kingdom, which is more in line with the expected formalities of a royal banquet.\n\nOverall, while both outputs are well-written and accurate, Output (a) demonstrates a better understanding of the medieval knight's code of conduct, provides more detailed information, and follows the instruction more closely.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

But is this a cop-out?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy Indian parents disapprove of my white boyfriend for his ethnicity and will probably be upset if he visits me while I'm abroad. Should I tell them about his visit, or just enjoy his company without dealing with family drama?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy boyfriend is visiting me while I'm in Europe, and I don't know if I should tell my parents about it.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Output (b) attempts to do so by providing a continuation of the story, while Output (a) seems to be unrelated to the original sentence. Output (b) does a better job of inferring the user's intention.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nThere is no factual information in the outputs that can be verified, so accuracy is not a major concern in this case.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) attempts to complete the story, while Output (a) does not. Output (b) is more complete in following the instruction.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is superior to Output (a) in terms of text quality, information richness, user intention inference, and completeness of instruction following. While Output (a) is unclear and unrelated to the original sentence, Output (b) provides a coherent and relevant continuation of the story.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) and Output (b) both have good text quality, with no noticeable spelling or grammatical errors. However, Output (a) has a more complex sentence structure and provides additional information, making it slightly more coherent and fluent.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more information than Output (b), including the profit and revenue of Company V, as well as a note about the other companies' profits. Output (b) only provides a brief answer to the question.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) is accurate in stating that Company Z has the highest profit margin, as the calculation (7/20 = 0.35) confirms. Output (a) is incorrect in stating that Company V has the highest profit, as it only has the highest profit in absolute terms, not as a ratio of revenue.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) directly answers the question and follows the instruction, while Output (a) does not directly answer the question and provides incorrect information.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (b) is more accurate and directly answers the question, while Output (a) provides incorrect information and does not directly answer the question.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

We have been in a relationship for 2 years and have been best friends for 2 before that. He loves always having plans and hanging out with people, which I also sometimes enjoy doing but I also need nights where we can just stay in and watch movies or do nothing. Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns. How do I get him to see my point of view?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend is an extrovert and loves to hang out with friends, I am an introvert and need nights alone to relax. He doesn't understand my need for a night in, and it puts me under stress. How do I get him to understand?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy boyfriend and I are always busy and I need a night in. He thinks I'm being lazy and doesn't understand why I need a night in.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) lacks detail and fails to capture the essence of the original content. It only mentions the need for a night in and the boyfriend's misunderstanding, but it doesn't provide any context or explanation. Output (b) provides more information and context, highlighting the contrast between the boyfriend's extroverted nature and the speaker's introverted personality.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) doesn't fully capture the speaker's intention, which is to convey the stress and exhaustion caused by the constant socializing and the boyfriend's lack of understanding. Output (b) better infers the speaker's intention, highlighting the need for the boyfriend to understand the speaker's perspective.\n\n4.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Output (a) provides only two options, which may be sufficient for the task.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction asks for two rhymes, but Output (b) provides four options, which may be more than what the instruction asks for.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Output (a) only provides the sentiment score without explaining the type of sentiment.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs seem to accurately reflect the sentiment of the input statement, but Output (b) provides more context.\n\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nCreate a neural network for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs.\n\n# Output (b):\nA neural network can be used for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs. The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training. Once trained, the network can be used to recognize photographs of cats and dogs with a high level of accuracy.\n\n# Output (a):\nSure! Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

"Self-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 1, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

However, this criterion is not applicable in this case, as the instruction asks for a new sentence combining two given sentences.\n\n3.

Accuracy:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) are accurate in terms of the information they provide.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) follow the instruction to combine the two sentences. However, Output (a) does a better job of establishing a correct relationship between the two sentences.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (a) is more accurate in conveying the relationship between the two sentences, and it also follows the instruction more closely.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) and Output (b) both have good text quality, with clear and logical flow of ideas. However, Output (a) has a variable naming issue, where the variable \"sum\" is used as the accumulator, which is also the name of the built-in function in Python. This might cause confusion. Output (b) uses a more descriptive variable name \"total\", which is better.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither Output (a) nor Output (b) provides additional information or examples, which is acceptable since the instruction only asks for a function design.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) has a bug, where the variable \"sum\" is not initialized before being used in the loop. This will cause a NameError. Output (b) correctly initializes the variable \"total\" before using it.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) follow the instruction and return the sum of the numbers in the list.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, Output (b) is better in terms of text quality and accuracy, which are crucial aspects of the instruction task. Although Output (a) has a similar structure, the bug in the code and the variable naming issue make it less desirable. \n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -0.23804453015327454},

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) and Output (b) both demonstrate good text quality, with no noticeable spelling or grammatical errors. However, Output (a) has a more coherent and logical flow of ideas, with each sentence building upon the previous one to create a cohesive narrative. Output (b) has a slightly disjointed flow, with the introduction of the cave and hidden village feeling somewhat abrupt.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more detailed and vivid descriptions of the forest environment, such as the rustling leaves, birds flying in circles, and the arrangement of rocks. Output (a) focuses more on the overall atmosphere and John's emotional response to the forest, but lacks specific details.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction is clear and concise, so there is no need for user intention inference in this case.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their descriptions of a person walking through a forest.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) meets the instruction's requirement of a 5-sentence story, but Output (b) exceeds the sentence limit, providing 6 sentences instead of 5. This makes Output (b) incomplete in following the instruction.\n\nOverall, while Output (b) provides more detailed descriptions of the forest environment, its failure to meet the sentence limit and slightly disjointed flow of ideas detract from its overall quality. Output (a), on the other hand, provides a more cohesive narrative and meets the instruction's requirements. Therefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -0.07491012662649155}, {".": -5.960462772236497e-07}, {" Text": -1.5497195136049413e-06}, {" Quality": -1.1920928244535389e-07}, {":\n":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Information Richness:\nNeither output provides additional information beyond the original sentence, but Output (b) preserves the core idea and details of the original sentence.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) changes the term \"cloud computing\" to \"cloud hosting\", which may not be entirely accurate. Output (b) preserves the original term \"cloud computing\".\n\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Output (b) directly answers the question without providing any additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) does not provide a clear answer to the question, but it does provide some accurate information about the difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

It could also be a sudden break-up with a partner or a death in the family. Other common triggers are feeling left out or neglected by friends, or feeling isolated and alone.\n\n# Output (a):\nA hypothetical situation in which someone is feeling sad could be that of a teenage girl who has just moved to a new city and is finding it hard to make friends. She is lonely and homesick and feels like no one understands her. She is having a hard time adjusting to her new surroundings and is feeling down in the dumps.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-written, with no noticeable spelling or grammatical errors. However, Output (a) provides a more coherent and structured narrative, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. Output (b) is more of a list of possible situations, which makes it slightly less engaging and less easy to follow.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a more detailed and specific scenario, which makes it easier for the reader to imagine and relate to the situation. Output (b) provides a list of possible triggers for sadness, but it is more general and lacks specific details.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not particularly relevant in this case. However, Output (a) does a better job of providing a specific and detailed scenario, which suggests that it has done a better job of inferring the user's intention.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in the sense that they provide plausible scenarios in which a person might feel sad. However, Output (a) provides a more nuanced and detailed scenario, which makes it more believable and relatable.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to generate a hypothetical situation in which a person is feeling sad. However, Output (a) provides a more complete and detailed scenario, which suggests that it has done a better job of following the instruction.\n\nOverall, Output (a) provides a more detailed, specific, and nuanced scenario, which makes it more engaging, relatable, and believable.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more information and suggestions, such as searching for the bag and notifying authorities, which is helpful and relevant to the situation.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

The items are then sorted based on the values returned by this function.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to define a key for sorting. It is used to tell the function how to compare two strings to determine which one should be placed before the other in the sorted output.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) and Output (b) both have good text quality, with no spelling or grammatical errors. However, Output (b) is more precise and clear in its explanation, using technical terms like \"comparison key\" and \"input iterable\". Output (a) uses more general terms like \"define a key for sorting\" and \"compare two strings\", which may not be as accurate.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more detailed and technical information about the `key` argument, explaining how it is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the input iterable. Output (a) provides a more general explanation, but does not go into as much detail.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) is more accurate in its explanation of the `key` argument, as it correctly describes its purpose and how it is used. Output (a) is less accurate, as it implies that the `key` argument is only used for sorting strings.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction and provide an explanation of the `key` argument. However, Output (b) provides more complete information, as it explains what should be passed as inputs (i.e. a function of one argument).\n\nOverall, Output (b) is more precise, accurate, and provides more detailed information about the `key` argument.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGiven a base number and a power, calculate the result.\n\nBase:5   Power:3\n\n# Output (b):\n125\n\n# Output (a):\n5 x 5 x 5 = 625\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) provides a clear and well-structured response, showing the calculation process step by step. Output (b) is a single number, which is concise but lacks explanation.

Output (b) only provides the final result, lacking any additional information. In terms of information richness, Output (a) is better.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) provides a correct calculation process, but the result is incorrect (5 x 5 x 5 = 125, not 625). Output (b) provides the correct result, but without explanation. In terms of accuracy, Output (b) is better.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs attempt to follow the instruction, but Output (a) provides a calculation process, which is not explicitly requested. Output (b) only provides the final result, which is what the instruction asks for. In terms of completeness of instruction following, Output (b) is better.\n\nConsidering the importance of each aspect, while Output (a) excels in text quality and information richness, its inaccuracy is a significant drawback. Output (b), on the other hand, provides the correct result and follows the instruction more closely, despite lacking explanation.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) and Output (b) both have good text quality, with no spelling or grammatical errors. However, Output (a) is more well-structured and coherent, as it clearly defines the variable x and presents a solvable equation.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed and professional information by defining the variable x and presenting a solvable equation, whereas Output (b) simply states a basic arithmetic fact.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to generate a realistic mathematical equation for students to solve. Output (a) better infers this intention by providing a solvable equation, whereas Output (b) does not provide a solvable equation.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their mathematical content. However, Output (b) is more of a statement than an equation to be solved.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) better follows the instruction to generate a realistic mathematical equation for students to solve, as it provides a solvable equation. Output (b) does not provide a solvable equation, and therefore does not fully follow the instruction.\n\nConsidering the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, Output (a) is more well-structured, provides more detailed information, better infers the user's intention, and more completely follows the instruction. Although both outputs are accurate, the other aspects of Output (a) outweigh the simplicity of Output (b).\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -0.10270895808935165}, {".":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Output (b) is a single word, which is concise but lacks a clear explanation or context. However, it is also free of errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a more detailed and professional response by explaining that 'misleading' is the word that best matches the synonym of 'deceptive'. Output (b) only provides a single word, 'cunning', without any additional information or context.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured, with a clear and logical flow of ideas, as it lists the synonyms in a numbered format. Output (b) is also well-structured, but it is a simple list without any additional formatting. Both outputs are free of spelling and grammatical errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a list of 10 synonyms for 'sad' that are accurate and relevant. Output (b) also provides a list of 10 words, but some of them, such as \"Astounded\", \"Candidate\", and \"Circumstantial\", are not exact synonyms for 'sad'. Output (a) provides more accurate and relevant information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) provides a list of 10 accurate synonyms for 'sad'. Output (b) provides a list of 10 words, but some of them are not exact synonyms for 'sad', which makes it less accurate.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs provide a list of 10 words, which meets the user's request.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (a) is more accurate and provides more relevant information than Output (b). Although both outputs are well-structured and free of errors, the accuracy and relevance of the information provided are more important in this task.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

I'm a software engineer with over 10 years of experience in the industry and I'm passionate about creating useful and usable technology.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) has a clear and coherent introduction with proper grammar and spelling. Output (b) is incomplete and lacks specific details, making it less effective as an introduction.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more information about the speaker, including their name and profession, which can help establish credibility and context for the lecture. Output (b) is too general and lacks specific details.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction asks for a generalizable introduction, and Output (a) provides a clear and concise introduction that can be adapted to different fields. Output (b) is too vague and does not provide enough information to infer the speaker's expertise or relevance to the field.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in the sense that they do not provide any incorrect information. However, Output (b) is incomplete and lacks specific details, which may make it less effective as an introduction.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction more closely by providing a 1-2 sentence introduction that is generalizable to different fields. Output (b) is incomplete and does not provide a clear introduction.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is more effective in providing a clear and concise introduction that establishes the speaker's credibility and context for the lecture.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) and Output (b) both have good text quality, with no spelling or grammatical errors. However, Output (b) has a more coherent and logical flow of ideas, as it includes both the name and surname of the customer in the greeting.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither output provides additional information or examples, but this criterion is not applicable in this case as the instruction only asks to modify the function to accept and use two parameters.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in terms of the syntax and semantics of the function definition.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) follows the instruction more closely, as it uses both parameters (name and surname) in the greeting. Output (a) only uses one parameter (name) and ignores the second parameter (customer), which is not consistent with the instruction.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (b) is more complete in following the instruction and has a more coherent and logical flow of ideas.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It is also coherent and has a clear flow of ideas. Output (b) is also free of errors, but it uses sensational language, which may be seen as less professional.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither output provides rich or detailed information, as the instruction only asks for a new headline. However, Output (a) is more concise and to the point, while Output (b) uses more dramatic language.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in the sense that they provide a new headline. However, Output (b) is misleading, as it implies that there is a single secret that can revolutionize one's life, which may not be the case.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction more closely, as it generates a new headline that is less clickbait. Output (b) does not follow the instruction, as it is even more clickbait than the original headline.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it follows the instruction more closely, is more concise and to the point, and does not use sensational language.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Information Richness:\nNeither output provides additional information beyond the instruction, but Output (b) clearly labels the categories as \"Input devices\" and \"Output devices\", which is more informative than Output (a)'s \"Group 1\" and \"Group 2\".\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately group the items into two categories, but Output (b) correctly identifies the categories as \"Input devices\" and \"Output devices\", while Output (a) only labels them as \"Input device\" and \"Output device\" without the plural form.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) directly follows the instruction to group the items into two categories, while Output (a) lists the items first and then attempts to group them, which is not necessary.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is more concise, informative, and accurately follows the instruction. Although Output (a) also groups the items correctly, its phrasing and presentation are less clear and concise. Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -0.08866260945796967}, {".": -4.768370445162873e-07}, {" Text": -7.152555099310121e-07}, {" Quality": -1.1920928244535389e-07}, {":\n":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) demonstrates a higher level of text quality, using a more varied and sophisticated vocabulary (\"Swift-footed\", \"darted onward\") and a more complex sentence structure. In contrast, Output (b) is a simple sentence with a basic structure. However, both outputs are free of spelling and grammatical errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither output provides additional information beyond the original sentence, but Output (a) uses more descriptive language to convey the same idea, making it more engaging and vivid.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately convey the original sentence's meaning.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) better fulfills the instruction to rewrite the sentence using a variety of grammar, punctuation, and structure, as it employs a more creative and varied sentence structure. Output (b) is a more straightforward and simple rewrite, which does not fully meet the instruction's requirements.\n\nConsidering the importance of each aspect, Output (a) excels in text quality, information richness, and completeness of instruction following, which are crucial for a creative rewriting task. While Output (b) is accurate and free of errors, it falls short in meeting the instruction's requirements for variety and creativity.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (b) uses a more complex sentence structure, which may make it slightly more difficult to understand. Output (a) uses a simpler sentence structure, making it easier to comprehend.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither output provides additional information beyond the sentence constructed using the given words. However, Output (b) uses the words in a more creative and meaningful way, conveying a sense of how the hesitant effervescence of someone's words can reveal their integrity.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, which is to construct a sentence using the given words. Therefore, this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately use the given words in a sentence.\n\n5.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWrite an SQL query to find all words that start with the letter 'd'.\n\n# Output (b):\nSELECT word FROM table WHERE word LIKE 'd%';\n\n# Output (a):\nSELECT word FROM words WHERE word = 'd';\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (a) contains a logical error in the SQL query, which may indicate a lack of coherence in the response.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither output provides additional information or explanations, which is acceptable given the simplicity of the instruction.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is inaccurate because it only selects words that are exactly 'd', whereas the instruction asks for words that start with 'd'. Output (b) is accurate because it uses the LIKE operator with a wildcard to select words that start with 'd'.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) does not follow the instruction completely because it does not select words that start with 'd', but rather only the word 'd'. Output (b) follows the instruction completely.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (b) is more accurate and complete in following the instruction, which are critical aspects in this context. Although both outputs have good text quality, the logical error in Output (a) outweighs its text quality.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nDetermine the most common word in the text. Humans are created in the image of God, from a spiritual perspective and from a physical perspective.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe most common word in the text is \"humans\", which appears twice.\n\n# Output (a):\n\"from\", \"a\", and \"perspective\"\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) provides a list of words without any explanation or context, while Output (b) provides a clear and concise sentence that answers the question. Output (b) is more fluent and well-structured.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides additional information about the frequency of the most common word, which is helpful. Output (a) only lists three words without any explanation.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) claims that \"humans\" is the most common word, but it appears only once in the text. Output (a) lists three words that are actually the most common in the text.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) does not accurately follow the instruction, as it incorrectly identifies the most common word. Output (a) provides a correct answer, but it does not explain why these words are the most common.\n\nOutput (a) is more accurate and provides a correct answer, although it lacks explanation and context. Output (b) is more fluent and well-structured, but it provides an incorrect answer. Considering the importance of accuracy in this task, Output (a) is more relevant to the instruction.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -0.1234302967786789}, {".":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more information by specifying the correction needed, whereas Output (a) only provides the corrected sentence without explaining the correction.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in correcting the error.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction asks to \"suggest one correction\", and Output (b) directly addresses this by providing a specific correction. Output (a) only provides the corrected sentence, but does not explicitly state the correction.\n\nThe instruction requires the output to not only correct the error but also to suggest the correction.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

It should offer high-quality, original information that is regularly updated to remain current. Multimedia elements like images, videos, and infographics should complement the text to enhance understanding and retain user interest. Clear, concise language and well-structured formatting, including short paragraphs, bullet points, and subheadings, make the content easily digestible. Above all, the content should provide genuine value to the user, addressing their needs or queries while maintaining authenticity and credibility.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe ideal website should have a clean, modern, and visually appealing look. It should have a well-organized layout with a consistent color scheme that aligns with the brand's identity. The website should also have a responsive design, meaning it should look good and function well on all devices.\n\nIn terms of feel, the website should be user-friendly and intuitive. The website should also make users feel secure, especially if they're required to enter personal information or make a purchase.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) and Output (b) both demonstrate good text quality, with clear and coherent writing styles. However, Output (b) has a more sophisticated tone and uses more complex vocabulary, making it slightly more engaging to read. Output (a) is concise and easy to understand, but its language is more straightforward and lacks the depth of Output (b).\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more detailed and specific information about the ideal website content, including the importance of multimedia elements, clear language, and well-structured formatting. Output (a) focuses more on the visual aspects of the website and its user experience, but lacks the depth and richness of information provided by Output (b).\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction asks for a description of the look and feel of an ideal website, which implies a focus on both visual and experiential aspects. Output (a) addresses the visual aspects and user experience, while Output (b) focuses more on the content and its presentation. Both outputs make reasonable inferences about the user's intention, but Output (b) provides more relevant information.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs provide accurate information about the characteristics of an ideal website. However, Output (b) provides more specific and detailed information, making it more accurate in its description.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) partially addresses the instruction by describing the look and feel of an ideal website, but focuses more on the visual aspects. Output (b) also partially addresses the instruction, but focuses more on the content and its presentation. Neither output fully addresses both aspects of the instruction.\n\nOverall, while both outputs have their strengths and weaknesses, Output (b) provides more detailed and specific information, making it more accurate and informative. Output (a) is concise and easy to understand, but lacks the depth and richness of information provided by Output (b).

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed information by classifying each emotion individually, whereas Output (b) only provides a general statement about three emotions.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (b) has a more coherent and logical flow of ideas, with a clear and concise explanation of the differences between Shakespearean and modern English. The text is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. Output (a) is also well-written, but the text is slightly more fragmented and lacks a clear connection between the different points mentioned.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides a richer and more detailed explanation of the differences between Shakespearean and modern English, including specific examples of vocabulary and sentence structure. Output (a) provides some general information about the differences, but lacks specific examples and details.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their descriptions of Shakespearean and modern English.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) provides a brief example of the differences between Shakespearean and modern English, as requested in the instruction. Output (a) does not provide a specific example, despite mentioning the differences in vocabulary and grammar.\n\nOverall, Output (b) provides a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of the differences between Shakespearean and modern English, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.

English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.", "output_2": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides detailed information about the sentence's grammatical structure, including the subject, verb phrase, object, and relative clause.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Text Quality:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) have good text quality, with no noticeable spelling or grammatical errors. However, Output (b) has a more engaging and dynamic tone, with the use of phrases like \"And now, let me randomly select one for your character...\" and \"The chosen species for your character is...\". Output (a) is more straightforward and lacks this level of enthusiasm.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more information than Output (a), as it not only lists the species but also randomly selects one and provides a brief description of the character's ability. Output (a) only lists the species without any additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs seem to understand the user's intention, which is to create a super-powered character and start by selecting a species. However, Output (b) goes a step further by randomly selecting a species and providing a brief description, which shows a better understanding of the user's intention to progressively build the character.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in providing a list of species for the character. However, Output (b) also accurately follows the instruction to randomly select one of the species, which Output (a) does not do.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) fully follows the instruction, providing a list of species and then randomly selecting one. Output (a) only partially follows the instruction, as it only provides a list of species but does not randomly select one.\n\nOverall, while both outputs have good text quality, Output (b) excels in terms of information richness, user intention inference, accuracy, and completeness of instruction following. Output (b) provides a more engaging and dynamic response that better meets the user's needs and follows the instruction more closely.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Information Richness:\nNeither output provides rich or detailed information, but Output (a) provides a slightly clearer explanation. However, the instruction does not ask for additional information, so this criterion is not highly relevant.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) is accurate in identifying \"Kilogram\" as the word that does not belong to others, as it is a unit of weight, while the others are units of length. Output (a) is incorrect in identifying \"Inch\" as the word that does not belong to others.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) directly answers the question, while Output (a) provides a brief explanation but incorrectly identifies the word that does not belong to others. Both outputs follow the instruction to identify the word that does not belong to others.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (b) is more accurate and directly answers the question, while Output (a) provides a clearer structure but is incorrect.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is brief and to the point, but it lacks specificity and clarity in presenting the exact dates.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more detailed information by specifying the exact dates, including the day and month, whereas Output (a) only provides a range of years.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in terms of the dates mentioned, but Output (b) provides more precise information.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction asks to extract all the dates from the paragraph.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nTell the story of the Russian Revolution, in the way of a sarcastic mean girl. Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (b) is written in a sarcastic and informal tone, which may be engaging for some readers but may also come across as unprofessional or immature.

Output (b) clearly meets this intention, while Output (a) does not.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are generally accurate in their account of the Russian Revolution. However, Output (b) includes some minor inaccuracies and exaggerations, such as the claim that the Bolsheviks \"took control and established the Soviet Union\" immediately after the Tsar's abdication.\n\n5.

It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.", "output_2": "Oh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit? The school might not see the problem with their actions, but their insurance might. Maybe submitting a claim would get their attention?\n\n# Output (a):\nThese people can\u2019t be trusted whatsoever, you should make a scene at his school to show people the consequences of their ill behavior.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

The sentences are coherent, and the flow of ideas is clear and logical. Output (a) is more concise but lacks the clarity and coherence of Output (b).\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more detailed and professional information about the languages spoken in the United States. It mentions specific languages, their regional distribution, and their cultural significance. Output (a) provides some general information but lacks the depth and richness of Output (b).\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction asks for a compare-and-contrast essay, which implies that the user wants a detailed analysis of the languages spoken in the United States. Output (b) provides a more comprehensive comparison of the languages, highlighting their differences and similarities. Output (a) provides a brief overview but does not fully address the user's intention.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are generally accurate, but Output (b) provides more specific and accurate information about the languages spoken in the United States. Output (a) makes some general statements that may not be entirely accurate, such as the percentage of the population that speaks Spanish.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) follows the instruction more closely, providing a detailed compare-and-contrast essay that meets the common requirements of such an essay. Output (a) provides a brief overview but does not fully address the instruction.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is more comprehensive, detailed, and accurate in its analysis of the languages spoken in the United States.

French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.", "output_2": "The United States is a linguistically diverse country with over 350 languages spoken. The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.", "instruction": "Compare and contrast the languages spoken in the United States, following the common requirements of writing a compare-and-contrast essay", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}
{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nDo you know of anyone who was unable to become an engineer despite getting the degree and their best efforts? Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is concise but lacks coherence and clarity in its response. The text jumps abruptly from discussing interview techniques to mentioning the importance of learning on the fly in engineering jobs. Output (b), on the other hand, provides a well-structured and coherent response, with each point clearly explained and separated.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more detailed and relevant information, offering specific advice on networking, skill enhancement, and considering a CAD operator position. Output (a) provides limited information and focuses mainly on interviewing techniques, without providing substantial advice on addressing the situation described.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) demonstrates a better understanding of the user's concerns and intentions, addressing the fear of being unable to get a career started and the worry about accepting a non-engineering position. Output (a) seems to misunderstand the user's concerns, focusing on interviewing techniques without addressing the broader issues.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs appear to provide accurate information, but Output (b) is more relevant to the user's situation and provides more accurate advice on how to address the challenges faced.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) better follows the instruction to provide advice on the situation described, offering a more comprehensive and relevant response. Output (a) fails to fully address the user's concerns and provides limited advice.\n\nConsidering the importance of each aspect, Output (b) excels in providing a well-structured, coherent, and relevant response that addresses the user's concerns and intentions.

However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Turn off electronics and appliances when not in use. Turn down the thermostat a few degrees. The poster aims to quickly convey the message that individual actions to save electricity today contribute to a brighter and sustainable future for everyone. The split image visually contrasts the choices we make now with the positive outcomes we can achieve. Remember, a successful poster communicates the message clearly and concisely while capturing the viewer's attention. The \"Brighten Tomorrow, Conserve Today\" concept emphasizes the urgency and rewards of energy conservation in a visually impactful way.\n\n# Output (a):\nPoster: Save Electricity, Illuminate Tomorrow**\n\n**Background Image:**\nThe background image depicts a serene and beautiful planet Earth seen from space, with a bright, radiant sun on one side symbolizing energy. The Earth is surrounded by a gentle glow, emphasizing the importance of preserving our planet's resources.\n\n**Text Positions:**\n1. **Title:** Centered at the top of the poster in bold and vibrant letters:\n   \"Save Electricity, Illuminate Tomorrow\"\n\n2. **Slogan:** Just below the title, in a slightly smaller font:\n   \"Empower Change, Conserve Energy\"\n\n3. **Main Message:** Positioned in the middle of the poster, in a larger font:\n   \"Join the Movement! Be a Watt-saver.\"\n\n4. **Tips for Saving Electricity:** Aligned horizontally across the bottom of the poster, each tip bulleted:\n   - \"Switch off lights when not in use.\"\n   - \"Unplug chargers to prevent energy wastage.\"\n   - \"Use energy-efficient appliances.\"\n   - \"Opt for natural light during the day.\"\n\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) demonstrates a higher level of text quality, with a clear and logical flow of ideas, and is free of spelling and grammatical errors. The text is well-structured and coherent, making it easier to read and understand. Output (b) also has good text quality, but it is more concise and lacks the level of detail and structure seen in Output (a).\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed and professional information, including specific tips for saving electricity and a clear call to action. The use of a background image and text positions adds to the richness of the information. Output (b) provides some general tips, but lacks the level of detail and specificity seen in Output (a).\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not highly applicable. However, Output (a) does a better job of inferring the user's intention and providing relevant information, such as the background image and text positions.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their information, but Output (a) provides more specific and detailed information, making it more accurate in its execution of the instruction.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) more closely follows the instruction, providing a detailed description of the poster, including the background image, text positions, and text contents. Output (b) provides some general information, but lacks the level of detail and specificity requested in the instruction.\n\nOverall, Output (a) demonstrates a higher level of text quality, information richness, and completeness of instruction following.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides a brief introduction to the list of prime numbers, which makes it more informative and helpful. Output (a) only provides a list of numbers without any additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) starts with the smallest prime number possible, which is 2. Output (b) starts with 5, which is not the smallest prime number possible. Therefore, Output (a) is more accurate.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs provide ten prime numbers, but Output (a) starts with the smallest prime number possible, while Output (b) does not. Therefore, Output (a) better follows the instruction.\n\nOverall, while Output (b) is more well-structured and coherent, Output (a) is more accurate and better follows the instruction.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

But despite its welcoming warmth, it also presented a danger.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe fire's warmth was comforting and inviting, filling the room with a pleasant orange glow. It was a danger that could not be ignored.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) and Output (b) both demonstrate good text quality, with no noticeable spelling or grammatical errors. However, Output (b) has a more coherent and logical flow of ideas, as it uses a contrasting transition word \"But\" to connect the two ideas, making the sentence more cohesive.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither output provides additional information beyond the original sentences, but Output (b) does a better job of condensing the information into a more concise and clear paragraph.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately convey the information from the original sentences.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) more closely follows the instruction to form the sentences into a coherent paragraph, as it combines the ideas into two sentences that flow logically. Output (a) also forms a coherent paragraph, but it omits the word \"welcoming\" from the original sentence, which is a minor deviation from the instruction.\n\nConsidering the analysis above, Output (b) has a slight edge over Output (a) in terms of text quality, information richness, and completeness of instruction following. While both outputs are accurate and meet the basic requirements, Output (b) demonstrates a more cohesive and concise writing style.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, environmentalist, and philanthropist.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) has a higher text quality as it provides a clear and structured list with proper formatting, making it easier to read and understand. Output (b) is a simple sentence that lists the names, but lacks proper formatting and detail. Output (a) also uses more descriptive language, such as \"climate change advocate\" and \"environmentalist\", which adds to the overall quality of the text.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed information about each public figure, including their occupation and a brief description of their role in supporting renewable energy. Output (b) only lists the names of the public figures without providing any additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable in this case.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs provide accurate information about public figures who support renewable energy. However, Output (a) provides more accurate and detailed information about each figure's occupation and role.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to name three public figures who support renewable energy. However, Output (a) provides more complete information by including the occupation and a brief description of each figure's role.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is more detailed, accurate, and provides a higher text quality compared to Output (b).

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWhat is an antonym for the word \"cogent\"?\n\n# Output (b):\nunconvincing\n\n# Output (a):\nThe antonym of the word \"cogent\" is \"irrelevant\".\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) provides a more structured response with a clear subject-verb-object construction, whereas Output (b) is a single word. However, both outputs are free of spelling and grammatical errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a more detailed response by explicitly stating that \"irrelevant\" is the antonym of \"cogent\". Output (b) only provides the antonym without any additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) provides a more accurate response, as \"unconvincing\" is indeed an antonym of \"cogent\". Output (a) provides an incorrect response, as \"irrelevant\" is not a direct antonym of \"cogent\".\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to provide an antonym for the word \"cogent\".\n\nConsidering the importance of each aspect, accuracy is the most critical criterion in this case, as providing an incorrect antonym would not fulfill the user's request. Although Output (a) provides a more structured response, its inaccuracy outweighs its text quality.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Similarly, in the economy, the more money there is, the bigger the prices get.\n\n# Output (a):\nInflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. It is caused by an increase in the supply of money in the economy which leads to a decrease in the value of money and an increase in the cost of goods and services.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors, providing a clear and concise definition of inflation. Output (b) uses a simple analogy to explain inflation, but the text is not as polished and lacks a clear definition.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a more detailed and professional explanation of inflation, including its causes and effects. Output (b) uses a simple analogy, but it lacks depth and does not provide additional information about inflation.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) provides an accurate definition of inflation, while Output (b) uses an analogy that is not entirely accurate. The analogy in Output (b) implies that inflation is solely caused by an increase in the money supply, which is an oversimplification.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs attempt to define inflation in simple terms, but Output (a) provides a more complete and accurate definition.\n\nOverall, Output (a) excels in terms of text quality, information richness, and accuracy, providing a clear and concise definition of inflation.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is a short and simple sentence that is free of spelling and grammatical errors. Output (b) is also well-structured and free of errors, but it is a bit longer and more complex.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more information about the origin of the phrase \"Who wears short shorts?\", including the name of the song and the band that released it. Output (a) only provides a vague answer that doesn't add much value to the conversation.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, but Output (b) makes a reasonable inference that the user is asking about the origin of the phrase. Output (a) doesn't make any inference and only provides a generic answer.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in the sense that they don't provide any false information. However, Output (b) provides more accurate and specific information about the origin of the phrase.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to talk about who wears short shorts, but Output (b) provides more relevant and interesting information.\n\nOverall, while Output (a) is a simple and error-free response, it doesn't add much value to the conversation. Output (b), on the other hand, provides more information, makes a reasonable inference about the user's intention, and is more accurate and relevant to the topic. Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -0.15171274542808533}, {".": -7.152555099310121e-07}, {" Text": -3.576278118089249e-07}, {" Quality": -1.1920928244535389e-07}, {":\n":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nDetect if the following item is a prime number: 17\n\n# Output (b):\nNo, 17 is not a prime number.\n\n# Output (a):\nYes, 17 is a prime number.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Information Richness:\nNeither Output (a) nor Output (b) provides additional information or explanations, but this is not necessary in this case since the instruction only asks for a simple detection of whether the number is prime or not.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so there is no need for inference or clarification.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is accurate, as 17 is indeed a prime number. Output (b) is incorrect, as it states that 17 is not a prime number.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) follow the instruction completely, as they both provide a clear answer to the question.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most important aspect in this case is accuracy, as the instruction is asking for a specific detection.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nCan you provide a syntactic inversion of the following sentence?\nThe trees were covered with snow.\n\n# Output (b):\nCovered with snow were the trees.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe trees were not covered with snow.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) are free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (a) changes the meaning of the original sentence by adding \"not\", which is not a syntactic inversion. Output (b) maintains the original meaning and is a correct syntactic inversion.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither output provides additional information or explanations, which is acceptable given the instruction's request for a simple syntactic inversion.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) is accurate in providing a correct syntactic inversion of the original sentence. Output (a) is inaccurate because it changes the meaning of the original sentence.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) follows the instruction completely by providing a syntactic inversion of the original sentence. Output (a) does not follow the instruction because it changes the meaning of the original sentence instead of inverting the syntax.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (b) meets all the criteria better than Output (a).

Output (a), on the other hand, changes the meaning of the original sentence and does not follow the instruction.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -0.11086216568946838}, {".":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

For example, a neural network can be used to tell you if an image is showing a cat or a dog. What are the basic mathematical requirements needed to get into neural networks?

Note that I don't mean to be an expert but a good AI engineer.\n\n# Output (b):\nGenerally, you should have a good understanding of:\n- linear algebra, especially of matrix operations\n- calculus, including computing derivatives\n- probabilities and statistics\n\n# Output (a):\nHaving a basic understanding of the math behind neural networks is really important to understand how they work in case you need to debug or optimize your algorithm. It would be better to have a good understanding of some mathematics topics:\n\n1. Numbers and counting: Numbers can be thought of as the building blocks of mathematics. There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events. It is a way pivotal part of many areas of mathematics, science, technology, and more. It is also helpful for simply interacting with other people and the world around us. Everyday examples of measurements include height, weight, temperature, and distance.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

However, Output (a) is well-structured and free of errors, while Output (b) is also error-free but lacks detail.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a more comprehensive overview of mathematical concepts, but it may be too general and not specifically tailored to neural networks. Output (b) provides more relevant and specific information about the mathematical requirements for neural networks, but it is brief and lacks examples or explanations.\n\n3.

Output (a) seems to provide a more general overview of mathematical concepts, which may not be directly relevant to the user's question.\n\n4.

There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Accuracy:\nOutput (b) uses the word \"bountiful\", which is a suitable synonym for \"generous\".

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nAnalyze given speech for sentiment:\nI'm so grateful for the help and support that I received from my family.\n\n# Output (b):\nPositive sentiment.\n\n# Output (a):\nNegative sentiment\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Information Richness:\nNeither Output (a) nor Output (b) provides additional information or context about the sentiment analysis. However, given the simplicity of the instruction, this criterion is not highly relevant in this case.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) accurately identifies the sentiment of the given speech as positive, as the speaker expresses gratitude. Output (a), on the other hand, incorrectly identifies the sentiment as negative.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) follow the instruction to analyze the sentiment of the given speech. However, Output (a) fails to provide an accurate analysis.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (b) is more accurate and provides a correct sentiment analysis, which is the primary requirement of the instruction.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nRevise the following statement so that it is grammatically correct:\nThe history of the United Sates are full of remarkable milestones\n\n# Output (b):\nThe history of the United States is full of remarkable milestones.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe history of the United States are full of remarkable milestones.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) accurately revises the statement to make it grammatically correct. Output (a) does not accurately revise the statement, as it contains the same grammatical error as the original statement.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) completely follows the instruction by revising the statement to make it grammatically correct. Output (a) does not completely follow the instruction, as it fails to correct the grammatical error.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (b) meets all the criteria, while Output (a) fails to meet the criteria of Text Quality, Accuracy, and Completeness of Instruction Following.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

They are more efficient than regular cars and produce fewer emissions.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more specific and detailed information about eco-friendly travel options, such as looking for an airline with a lower carbon footprint.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a direct and professional solution to the problem, using the datetime module in Python. Output (b) also provides a solution but it is not as rich in information and does not use any external modules or functions.\n\n3.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

It suggests that someone did not do something because they were too tired, when in fact there may be other reasons why they did not shop. It could be interpreted as someone trying to avoid responsibility or justify their actions.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe sentence means that the person decided not to shop because they lacked the energy to do so. This shows that the person is either too busy or too exhausted to shop, indicating that they may be busy with other activities or just might not have the energy to shop. This sentence also reveals the person's lack of interest in shopping, which could be due to financial or time constraints.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (a) provides a clearer and more logical flow of ideas, as it breaks down the sentence into its constituent parts and provides a more detailed analysis. Output (b) is also coherent, but its ideas are not as well-developed.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed and professional information, as it offers possible explanations for the person's lack of energy and lack of interest in shopping. Output (b) provides some relevant information, but it is more superficial and does not offer as much depth.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their analysis of the sentence. However, Output (b) makes an assumption that the sentence is an excuse, which may not necessarily be the case. Output (a) provides a more neutral analysis.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to analyze the sentence, but Output (a) provides a more comprehensive analysis.\n\nOverall, Output (a) provides a more detailed and accurate analysis of the sentence, with a clearer and more logical flow of ideas.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nDescribe scenarios in which the instruction \"Go outside\" can have different meanings/intentions\n\n# Output (b):\nThe instruction \"Go outside\" can have different meanings depending on the situation. For example, if a parent tells their child to go outside to play, it can mean leaving the house and going to a nearby park or play area. But if a doctor tells a patient to go outside, it can mean stepping outside of the hospital or clinic for some fresh air and relaxation. In both cases, the literal act of going outside is the same, but the intent behind the instructions can be drastically different.\n\n# Output (a):\n1. Going for a walk, either alone or with friends.\n2. Going to a park or other outdoor area to play a game or engage in some activity.\n3. Getting some fresh air or sunshine. \n4. Going to work outside of the house or office.\n5. Going to a store or other commercial establishment that is located outside. \n6. Leaving the house and coming back inside.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) provides a list of scenarios in a clear and concise manner, but the text is not well-structured as a cohesive paragraph. Output (b) presents a well-structured text with a clear and logical flow of ideas, making it more readable and engaging.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a list of scenarios, but they are brief and lack explanation or context. Output (b) provides more detailed and professional information by explaining the different meanings of the instruction \"Go outside\" in various situations.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) does a better job of inferring the user's intention by providing examples that illustrate the different meanings of the instruction \"Go outside\". Output (a) simply lists scenarios without providing any context or explanation.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their descriptions of scenarios, but Output (b) provides more accurate and nuanced explanations of the different meanings of the instruction.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs attempt to follow the instruction, but Output (b) provides a more complete response by explaining the different meanings of the instruction \"Go outside\" in various situations.\n\nOverall, while Output (a) provides a list of scenarios, Output (b) provides more detailed and professional information, better infers the user's intention, and provides more accurate and nuanced explanations. Output (b) also presents a well-structured text with a clear and logical flow of ideas, making it more readable and engaging.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

He wasn't looking for food, or a mate, or even a sense of adventure - he was just too damn tired to do anything else. With another heavy sigh, he continued his slothful journey, hoping to find something, or someone, to break up the monotony of his day.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) has a higher text quality compared to Output (b). The sentence structure is more varied, and the use of adjectives such as \"lazy\", \"lush\", \"massive\", \"weary\", and \"slothful\" creates a vivid image in the reader's mind. The writing is also more engaging, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. Output (b), on the other hand, is more straightforward and lacks the descriptive language that makes Output (a) more immersive.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed and professional information about the lazy elephant's state of mind and behavior. The addition of the elephant's thoughts and feelings adds depth to the story, making it more engaging and relatable. Output (b) is more concise but lacks the richness of information that makes Output (a) more compelling.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, which is to generate a short story from a single sentence. Therefore, this criterion is not applicable in this case.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their representation of the lazy elephant. However, Output (a) provides more context and background information that makes the story more believable and accurate.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to generate a short story from a single sentence. However, Output (a) provides a more complete and detailed story that meets the user's request more effectively.\n\nOverall, Output (a) excels in text quality, information richness, and completeness of instruction following.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nReformat the sentence so it is a question: I was surprised by the outcome.\n\n# Output (b):\nWhat was most surprising was the outcome.\n\n# Output (a):\nWhat surprised you about the outcome?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (a) is more coherent and has a clearer flow of ideas, as it directly addresses the original sentence and turns it into a question.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither output provides additional information beyond the original sentence, but Output (a) is more engaging and encourages further discussion by asking a specific question.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately reformat the original sentence, but Output (a) is more precise in capturing the original meaning and tone.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) more closely follows the instruction to reformat the sentence as a question, as it directly addresses the original sentence and turns it into a question. Output (b) changes the sentence structure and adds new words, which deviates from the original instruction.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is more effective in reformatting the sentence as a question while maintaining the original meaning and tone. It is more coherent, engaging, and accurately captures the user's intention. Output (b) deviates from the original instruction and changes the sentence structure, making it less accurate.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -0.07745765894651413}, {".":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (a) contains an extra number \"1\" which is not present in the original list, indicating a potential error.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither Output (a) nor Output (b) provides any additional information beyond the sorted list, which is acceptable given the instruction's requirements.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) accurately sorts the list according to the instruction, while Output (a) contains an extra number \"1\" which is not present in the original list, indicating an error.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) correctly follows the instruction by sorting the list in the specified order, while Output (a) fails to do so due to the extra number \"1\" and incorrect sorting of some numbers.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (b) meets all the criteria accurately, while Output (a) contains errors in terms of accuracy and completeness of instruction following.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWhat is the smallest positive integer number that is divisible by 5?\n\n# Output (b):\n15 is the smallest positive integer number that is divisible by 5.\n\n# Output (a):\n5\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is a single number and does not contain any text, so it is not possible to evaluate its text quality. Output (b) is a sentence that is grammatically correct and free of spelling errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) only provides the answer and does not provide any additional information. Output (b) also only provides the answer, but it provides it in the form of a sentence, which could be considered slightly more informative.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is accurate, as 5 is indeed the smallest positive integer number that is divisible by 5. Output (b) is incorrect, as 15 is not the smallest positive integer number that is divisible by 5.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) precisely executes the instruction, as it only provides the smallest positive integer number that is divisible by 5. Output (b) also attempts to execute the instruction, but it provides an incorrect answer.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (a) is more accurate and precisely executes the instruction, while Output (b) is incorrect.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

However, Output (b) is closer to fulfilling the instruction.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (b) is more detailed, coherent, and accurate, and provides more relevant information about the plumbing diagram. Although it does not mention the second floor, it is closer to fulfilling the instruction. Output (a) is too brief and lacks a clear description of the plumbing diagram.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -0.11769137531518936}, {".": -5.960462772236497e-07}, {" Text":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Provide three example sentences that use the word \u201credundant\u201d.\n\n# Output (a):\nSentence 1: The amount of money he was given was redundant as he had already received the maximum amount allowed. \nSentence 2: His constant complaining was highly redundant as nothing ever changed. \nSentence 3: All the unnecessary details in the report were redundant and quite exhausting to read.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) demonstrates high text quality, with well-structured and coherent sentences that are free of spelling and grammatical errors. In contrast, Output (b) contains short and uninformative sentences that lack proper structure and coherence.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides rich and detailed information by offering three example sentences that effectively demonstrate the meaning and usage of the word \"redundant\". Output (b) fails to provide any meaningful information, with two of its sentences being unhelpful and the third sentence simply repeating the instruction.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable. However, Output (a) still manages to provide relevant and useful information that meets the user's needs.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in the sense that they do not provide any incorrect information. However, Output (b) is essentially useless due to its lack of informative content.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) fully follows the instruction by providing three example sentences that use the word \"redundant\" to show its meaning and usage. Output (b) fails to follow the instruction, as two of its sentences do not use the word \"redundant\" in a meaningful way, and the third sentence simply repeats the instruction.\n\nOverall, Output (a) excels in all aspects, providing high-quality text, rich and detailed information, and fully following the instruction. Output (b), on the other hand, falls short in all areas, providing low-quality text, lacking informative content, and failing to follow the instruction. Therefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -0.08647964149713516}, {".": -3.576278118089249e-07}, {" Text": -8.344646857949556e-07}, {" Quality": 0.0}, {":\n": -0.0017070496687665582},

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

It's the perfect way to unwind and get some exercise.\n\n# Output (a):\nWhat an amazing hobby! Where do you usually go?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more information about Tom's hobby, including his reasons for enjoying it. Output (a) does not provide any additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction does not clearly express a question or request for information, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in that they do not provide any false information.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction is a statement, not a question or request for information. Output (b) does not follow the instruction, as it turns the statement into a question and provides additional information. Output (a) also does not follow the instruction, as it responds to the statement as if it were a question.\n\nOutput (b) provides more information and context, but it does not follow the instruction. Output (a) is a more concise response, but it also does not follow the instruction. However, Output (b) is more engaging and provides more insight into Tom's hobby.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (a) has a more coherent and logical flow of ideas, with a clear and natural conversation between the two characters. Output (b) is brief and lacks detail, making it seem a bit abrupt.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed and professional information, with a richer conversation between the two characters. It includes specific details about their interests, work, and plans, making the conversation more engaging and realistic. Output (b) is brief and lacks depth, providing minimal information about the characters.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to write a script for a 10-second conversation, which implies a brief and concise conversation. Output (b) seems to follow this intention more closely, while Output (a) provides a longer and more detailed conversation that may not fit within the 10-second time frame.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in terms of the conversation flow and the information provided. However, Output (a) provides more specific details that may not be relevant to a 10-second conversation.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) seems to follow the instruction more closely, providing a brief and concise conversation that fits within the 10-second time frame. Output (a) provides a longer conversation that may not meet the time constraint.\n\nConsidering the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, I would prioritize Completeness of Instruction Following and Text Quality.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides a richer and more detailed description of friendship, using a metaphor to convey the idea that true friends are enduring and unwavering. Output (a) is a short and direct proverb that does not provide additional information.\n\n3.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) meets the instruction's requirement of creating an original proverb, while Output (a) does not.\n\nConsidering the importance of each aspect, I would weigh the completeness of instruction following and originality more heavily in this task.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Output (b) does not provide any new information, as it simply restates the original list.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so there is no need for inference or clarification.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is accurate, as it correctly divides each number in the list by 10. Output (b) is not accurate, as it does not perform the division.\n\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) demonstrate good text quality, with no apparent spelling or grammatical errors. However, Output (a) uses a more idiomatic expression \"as she once was\", which is a common way to express the idea that someone has changed over time. Output (b) uses a more literal phrase \"changed substantially over time\", which is also clear but slightly more formal.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither output provides additional information beyond the implied meaning of the sentence. However, Output (b) uses a more explicit phrase \"changed substantially over time\", which implies a greater degree of change. Output (a) is more concise and to the point.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear in this case, which is to infer the implied meaning of the sentence. Both outputs provide a reasonable inference, but Output (a) is more concise and directly addresses the implied meaning.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their interpretation of the sentence. However, Output (a) is more precise in capturing the nuance of the original sentence.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to infer the implied meaning of the sentence. However, Output (a) provides a more concise and direct response, which is more in line with the instruction.\n\nOverall, while both outputs are good, Output (a) is more concise, precise, and idiomatic in its expression.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

When a customer requests a taxi, the system needs to determine which taxi to send to the customer to minimize the total journey time for all customers. The taxi with the shortest estimated total journey time can be given the highest priority and served first. The system can serve the taxi with the highest priority first until one is served or the queue is empty.\n\n# Output (a):\nFor example, a total order of tasks can be established, with each task having a priority associated with it. Tasks with a higher priority can be given preference and processed before tasks with a lower priority. This ensures that the most important tasks are processed first.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

Output (a) provides a more general explanation of how tasks can be prioritized, but lacks specific details.\n\n3.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

The Seahawks' defense had some lapses, allowing the Texans to score 18 points in the second half.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe tone of the article is mostly positive, with an emphasis on Seattle's strong performance in the first half. However, there is a slight tone of frustration in the latter half of the article, with the mention of the Seahawks' \"lapses\" in defense.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe tone of this article is positive, emphasizing the Seahawks' defense as well as their ability to remain competitive against the Texans' offense. Its strong performance is quite impressive according to this article.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more detailed information about the tone of the article, mentioning the emphasis on Seattle's strong performance in the first half and the slight tone of frustration in the latter half. Output (a) provides a more general statement about the tone, without elaborating on specific aspects of the article.\n\n3.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I believe in Jesus Christ\n\n# Output (b):\nThe best way to defeat depression can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their condition. However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, don't hesitate to seek help.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe best way to defeat a demon is to use the power of God. Jesus Christ has the authority and power to defeat demons and to set the captive free. The Bible teaches us to pray to God for help in times of trouble, and to seek His will in our lives. God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful. But God is greater than any demon, and He has the power to defeat them. Trust in God and He will help you.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Output (b) provides more detailed information about strategies to defeat depression, but it is not relevant to the instruction.\n\n3.

God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful.

Trust in God and He will help you.", "output_2": "The best way to defeat depression can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their condition. However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nComplete the following sentence: \"Yesterday it was raining, so I put on my ____.\"\n\n# Output (b):\nYesterday it was raining, so I put on my raincoat.\n\n# Output (a):\nYesterday it was raining, so I put on my jacket to keep out the rain.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) and Output (b) both demonstrate good text quality, with no noticeable spelling or grammatical errors. However, Output (a) provides a more coherent and logical flow of ideas by adding a brief explanation of why the speaker put on their jacket.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed information by adding the phrase \"to keep out the rain\", which explains the purpose of putting on the jacket. Output (b) only provides a simple completion of the sentence without additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in completing the sentence, but Output (a) provides more context and explanation, making it more accurate in terms of understanding the speaker's intention.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs complete the sentence as instructed, but Output (a) provides more information than requested, while Output (b) provides a more direct and concise completion of the sentence.\n\nConsidering the importance of each aspect, I would prioritize Text Quality, Information Richness, and Accuracy. Output (a) excels in these areas by providing a more coherent and detailed completion of the sentence.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (b) is more concise and directly answers the question, while Output (a) provides more information but is slightly longer.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more information, including the full address of the restaurant, while Output (b) only provides the street address. However, the instruction only asks for the nearest restaurant, so the additional information in Output (a) is not necessarily relevant.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) provides a restaurant located in Chicago, IL, which is approximately 10 miles away from the given address in Evanston, IL. Output (b) provides a restaurant located on the same street as the given address, which is likely to be much closer. Therefore, Output (b) is more accurate.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) more closely follows the instruction to find the nearest restaurant from the given address, as it provides a restaurant located on the same street. Output (a) provides a restaurant located in a different city, which may not be the nearest option.\n\nBased on the analysis, Output (b) is more accurate and better follows the instruction to find the nearest restaurant from the given address. While Output (a) provides more information, the additional information is not relevant to the instruction, and the provided restaurant is not as close to the given address.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nHow can I identify Panther?\n\n# Output (b):\nThe Panther is a mostly solitary species of mammal found in Central and South America. It is distinguishable by its black-spotted coat and slender, sleek build.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Panther is a large, dangerous mammal, typically found in jungle areas. It is a member of the Felidae family and is closely related to the jaguar. Despite its ferocious reputation, it is actually an extremely shy and elusive creature, typically avoiding contact with humans.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) and Output (b) both demonstrate good text quality, with no noticeable spelling or grammatical errors. However, Output (a) has a more varied and engaging sentence structure, which makes it more readable and interesting.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed and professional information about the Panther, including its family classification, behavior, and reputation. Output (b) only provides a brief description of the Panther's physical appearance and habitat.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to identify the Panther, which implies a desire for distinctive characteristics or features. Both outputs attempt to provide some identifying features, but Output (a) goes further by mentioning the Panther's behavior and reputation, which could be useful for identification.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs appear to be accurate in their descriptions of the Panther. However, Output (a) provides more specific and detailed information, which suggests a higher level of accuracy.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to provide information about the Panther, but Output (a) provides more comprehensive information that addresses the user's implied desire for identifying features.\n\nOverall, Output (a) demonstrates better text quality, information richness, and completeness of instruction following. While both outputs are accurate, Output (a) provides more detailed and specific information that is likely to be more helpful for identifying the Panther.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more vivid and descriptive language, such as \"soaked\" and \"sudden downpour\", which adds more detail to the scene. Output (a) uses more general terms like \"drenched\" and \"pouring rain\", which is still descriptive but not as rich.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately convey the original meaning of the sentence.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to rewrite the sentence and keep its meaning unchanged.\n\nOverall, both outputs are of high quality, but Output (b) stands out for its more vivid and descriptive language, which makes the scene more engaging and immersive.
