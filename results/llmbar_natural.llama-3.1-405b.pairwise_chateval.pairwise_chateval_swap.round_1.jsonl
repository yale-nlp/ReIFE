The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Previous referees' arguments:\nGeneral Public: \n\nI have carefully evaluated both outputs based on the instruction provided.

This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him.

This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends.

It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Previous referees' arguments:\nGeneral Public: \n\nIn evaluating the two outputs, I considered how well they explained why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

While Output (b) may be less detailed and less organized than Output (a), I believe that its NLP-specific focus and insights make it more relevant to the instruction.\n\nFurthermore, I disagree with the General Public's statement that Output (a) is more detailed and provides specific examples of how self-supervised learning can be applied in NLP. While Output (a) does provide some examples, they are not as NLP-specific as those mentioned in Output (b).\n\nIn conclusion, after re-evaluating both outputs and considering the previous judgments, I believe that Output (b) is more effective in explaining why self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP due to its specific focus on NLP and its unique insights.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better."]], "data": {"output_1": "Self-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 2}, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 2}

The phrase \"The hesitant effervescence of his words gave away his integrity\" is not only grammatically correct, but it also creates a vivid and evocative image in the reader's mind.

While it is still a clear and coherent sentence, it does not engage the reader in the same way that Output (b) does.\n\nFurthermore, I would argue that Output (b) better captures the essence of the instruction, which is to construct a sentence that uses the words \"effervescence\", \"hesitant\", and \"integrity\" in a meaningful way.

Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Previous referees' arguments:\nGeneral Public: \n\nIn evaluating the two outputs, I considered how well they executed the instruction to describe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.

Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Previous referees' arguments:\nGeneral Public: The instruction asks for the story of the Russian Revolution to be told in the way of a sarcastic mean girl, without worrying about potential political bias or offense.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit?

The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country.

Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it.
