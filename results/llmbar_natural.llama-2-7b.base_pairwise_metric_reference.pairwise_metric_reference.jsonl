We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\nHer visa to stay here is coming to an end later this year, then she will be forced to return to Malaysia despite opting to stay here if she had the choice. We have gone down the job route, to the point that she was offered the job here, but the employer failed to get a license to issue Visas on very petty grounds.\nI (and others) have suggested getting married. It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy girlfriend's visa to stay in the UK expires in a few months, and she wants to stay here, but she won't get married until she goes back to Malaysia.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years. We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\nUnderstood! Here are three concise questions that specifically target the given instruction:\n\n1.

Does the output convey the couple's perspectives and feelings towards the situation, including their hesitation to get married before the girlfriend's visa expires and their desire to maintain a close relationship despite the distance?\n3. Does the output provide any new insights or suggestions for how the couple can make their long-distance relationship work, taking into account their cultural differences and the challenges they may face?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nOf course, I'd be happy to help! It sounds like you and your girlfriend are facing a challenging situation with her visa expiring and the possibility of being separated for an extended period of time. Here are some potential options and perspectives to consider:\n\n1. Marriage: As you mentioned, getting married could be a way for your girlfriend to obtain a visa to stay in the UK. However, as she has expressed, she doesn't want to get married solely for the purpose of obtaining a visa. It's important to have a genuine and mutual desire to spend the rest of your lives together. Consider having an open and honest conversation about your feelings and priorities.\n2. Job opportunities: It's unfortunate that your girlfriend's employer failed to obtain the necessary license to issue visas. Explore other job opportunities in the UK that may offer better prospects for her to stay and work legally.\n3. Visa options: Research and explore other visa options that may be available for your girlfriend to stay in the UK. This could include a spouse visa, a family visa, or a work visa. Consult with a immigration lawyer or a UK Visa and Immigration Service to get a better understanding of the options available.\n4. Long-distance relationship: Living in different cultures on opposite sides of the world can be challenging, but it's not impossible to maintain a healthy and fulfilling relationship. Communication, trust, and mutual respect are key to making it work. Consider setting up regular video calls, sharing updates and photos, and making plans for future visits.\n5. Support network: Building a support network of friends and family can help ease the transition and provide emotional support during this time. Encourage your girlfriend to connect with other Malaysian expats in the UK, and consider joining a community or group for partners of international students.\n6. Flexibility: Be flexible and open to different scenarios. It's possible that your girlfriend may need to return to Malaysia temporarily to sort out her visa situation, but you can still maintain a long-distance relationship until she is able to return to the UK.\n7. Prioritize communication: Regular and honest communication is crucial in any relationship, especially when facing challenges like this. Make time to talk to each other, listen to each other's concerns, and work together to find solutions.\n\nIn summary, it's important to have open and honest communication, explore all available options, and prioritize the relationship. With patience, flexibility, and mutual respect, you and your girlfriend can find a way to make this work despite the challenges.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nHow many integers are in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10 ? \n\n# Output (a):\nThe inequality |x + 5| < 10 means that the absolute value of x + 5 is less than 10.\nSince the absolute value is always non-negative, this is equivalent to -10 < x + 5 < 10.\nSubtracting 5 from all parts, we get -15 < x < 5.\nTherefore, the solution set contains all integers between -15 and 5, exclusive. \nThere are 5 - (-15) - 1 = 19 integers in the solution set.\n\nSo the number of integers in the solution is 19\n\n# Output (b):\nThe list of integers that satisfy the inequality |x + 5| < 10 contains -4, -3, -2, -1 , 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Any integer smaller than -4 or larger than 4 will violate the inequality. Therefore, there are a total of 9 integers that satisfy |x + 10| < 5.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\nUnderstood! Here are three concise questions to evaluate the quality of the potential output for the given instruction:\n\n1. Does the output provide the exact number of integers in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10?\n2. Does the output accurately represent the inequality |x + 5| < 10, including the correct sign and magnitude of the inequality?\n3. Does the output precisely execute the instruction by providing a solution to the inequality |x + 5| < 10, including the correct number of integers?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nThere are 4 integers in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10: -4, -2, 0, and 2.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\nUnderstood! Here are three concise questions to help evaluate the quality of the potential output for the given instruction:\n\n1. Does the potential output accurately address the question of whether it is possible for a planet to have life but lack the resources for achieving space flight?\n2. Does the output provide a clear explanation of the resources required to build a rocket, and how the civilization in the story could potentially lack access to these resources?\n3. Does the output provide a logical and scientifically plausible reason for why the civilization in the story cannot find the necessary resources to build a rocket, despite their advanced technology and knowledge of space?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nYes, it is possible for a planet to have life but lack the resources for achieving space flight. In fact, there are several exoplanets that have been discovered in recent years that are considered \"resource-poor\" or \"resource-limited,\" meaning they do not have the necessary resources to support the development of a space program.\n\nThere are several reasons why a civilization might not have the resources to build a rocket:\n\n1. Lack of access to raw materials: A planet might have the necessary chemicals to create fuels and other materials needed for space travel, but lack the means to extract and process them.\n2. Limited energy resources: A civilization might have access to a limited amount of energy, which could make it difficult to produce the high-energy fuels needed for space travel.\n3. Inadequate technology: A civilization might have the necessary knowledge and skills to build a rocket, but lack the technology to produce the necessary materials or to design and construct a rocket that can withstand the stresses of space travel.\n4. Political or economic constraints: A civilization might have the resources to build a rocket, but lack the political or economic will to do so.\n\nIn your sci-fi story, you could explore the challenges and limitations faced by a civilization that wants to explore space but lacks the necessary resources. You could also consider the potential consequences of such a civilization's decision to prioritize other areas of development over space exploration.\n\nAs for the second part of your question, it is possible that a civilization could possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals for space flight, but lack the resources to produce them in sufficient quantities. For example, a civilization might have access to the necessary chemicals to create fuel for a rocket, but lack the means to produce the fuel in large quantities.\n\nOverall, the feasibility of a planet having life but lacking the resources for space flight depends on a variety of factors, including the planet's location in the galaxy, its distance from other stars, and the resources available on the planet.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her? Again, sorry for my bad english =/\n\n# Output (a):\nI want to tell my sister that she should avoid getting drunk with people she doesn't know or trust to avoid drowning risk, but I also want to make her aware that rape fear is a serious issue.\n\n# Output (b):\nI want to give some advice to my 17-year-old sister to avoid risky situations while drunk, without instilling rape fear or guilt in her.

I know you're old enough to make your own decisions, but I want to make sure you're aware of the potential dangers of drinking and being around people you don't know well, especially when it comes to situations where you could be at risk of sexual assault. I know it's not something anyone wants to think about, but it's important to be prepared and aware of the potential risks.\n\nI want you to know that you never have to feel guilty or responsible if something bad happens to you while you're drinking. You are not to blame for someone else's actions, and it's important to remember that. It's always better to be safe than sorry, and I want you to be aware of your surroundings and the people you're with.\n\nI also want to remind you that you can always say no to drinks or activities that make you uncomfortable, and it's okay to prioritize your own safety and well-being.

Pathos is often used to create an emotional connection with the audience and to persuade them on an emotional level.\n2. Ethos: Ethos, on the other hand, is about establishing the credibility and character of the speaker or writer. It involves demonstrating expertise, trustworthiness, and moral character to the audience. Ethos can be achieved through the use of credentials, experience, and consistency in argumentation.\n3. Logos: Logos is the appeal to reason and logic. It involves using evidence, statistics, and logical arguments to persuade the audience.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nSome people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus stop, half of the people got down and 4 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal? \n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (b):\nLet's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. \n\nAt the first stop, half of the people got down, so there were x/2 people left on the bus. Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\nUnderstood! Here are three concise questions to evaluate the quality of the potential output for the given instruction:\n\n1. Did the output accurately reflect the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal?\n2. Did the output accurately describe the number of people who got on and off the bus at each bus stop?\n3. Did the output precisely execute the instruction by providing the correct total number of people heading to the third stop?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nGreat, let's solve this problem together!\n\nAt the terminal, half of the people got on the bus, which means 12 people got on (since 12 is half of 25).\n\nThen, at the first bus stop, half of the remaining people got down, which means 6 people got down (since 6 is half of 12). So, the total number of people on the bus at the first bus stop is 12 - 6 = 6.\n\nAt the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 people got in, so the total number of people on the bus at the second bus stop is 6 + 8 = 14.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 people.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here?

Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster. Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors.

It's great to see that you're considering your options carefully. Pursuing a degree in engineering while still following your passion for physics is definitely possible.\n\nMany engineers have a strong foundation in physics, as it provides the mathematical and scientific basis for many engineering disciplines. In fact, many engineering fields, such as aerospace engineering, electrical engineering, and computer engineering, rely heavily on physics principles.\n\nIf you're interested in continuing your studies in physics while pursuing an engineering degree, you can always take courses in physics as electives or pursue a minor in physics. This will allow you to maintain your passion for physics while still fulfilling your family's expectations.\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider taking online courses or attending summer programs in physics to further your knowledge and skills in the field. These opportunities can help you stay up-to-date with the latest developments in physics and maintain your enthusiasm for the subject.\n\nIn terms of time management, it's important to prioritize your studies and make time for both engineering and physics. You can allocate specific times each week or month to focus on physics-related activities, such as reading articles, watching lectures, or working on projects.\n\nLastly, it's important to communicate with your family about your goals and aspirations.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nHow do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity? \n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Output (b):\nVaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of a virus or bacteria, or parts of its structure such as proteins, into a person's body. The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\nUnderstood! Here are three concise questions to evaluate the quality of a potential output for the given instruction:\n\n1. Does the output clearly explain how vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases?\n2. Does the output provide a clear definition of herd immunity, including how it is achieved through vaccination?\n3. Does the output accurately convey the importance of herd immunity in preventing the spread of infectious diseases in communities?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nGreat question! Vaccinations work by introducing a small, harmless piece of a virus or bacteria to the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. These antibodies remain in the body and provide protection against future infections with the same virus or bacteria.\n\nHerd immunity is a concept that explains how vaccination can protect not only the individual who receives the vaccine, but also the community as a whole. When a sufficient percentage of a population is vaccinated, it creates a barrier that prevents the spread of infectious diseases. This is because the virus or bacteria cannot find enough susceptible hosts to infect and spread to, thus preventing outbreaks and epidemics.\n\nIn simple terms, herd immunity is like a shield that protects the community by reducing the number of people who are susceptible to an infectious disease. This shield is created when a sufficient number of people in the community are vaccinated, which helps to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nFor example, if 90% of a community is vaccinated against measles, it is much harder for the measles virus to find enough susceptible hosts to infect and spread to, thus reducing the risk of an outbreak. This is why it's important to maintain high vaccination rates in a community to protect not only the individual who receives the vaccine, but also the community as a whole.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends.

This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\".

The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Output (b):\nA neural network can be used for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs. The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training. Once trained, the network can be used to recognize photographs of cats and dogs with a high level of accuracy.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Does the output include a fully connected neural network with at least two layers, as specified in the instruction?\n2. Does the output accurately classify cat's and dog's photographs into their respective categories, as specified in the instruction?\n3. Does the output include any additional features or modifications beyond what is specified in the instruction, such as normalization or data augmentation?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, here's a basic architecture for a neural network that can recognize cat and dog photographs:\n\n1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):\n\t* Use a pre-trained CNN as the base model, such as VGG16 or ResNet50.\n\t* Freeze the layers of the base model and add new layers on top.\n2.

In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3.

Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nDescribe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Output (b):\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\nUnderstood! Here are three concise questions to evaluate the quality of the output for the given instruction:\n\n1. Does the output provide a clear and accurate comparison of Shakespearean and modern English, highlighting the key differences between the two?\n2. Does the output provide a concrete example to illustrate the differences between Shakespearean and modern English, making it easier to understand the concept?\n3. Does the output accurately execute the instruction by specifically addressing the differences between Shakespearean and modern English, rather than simply providing a general overview of the two languages?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nCertainly! Shakespearean English and modern English have several differences in grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. Here's a brief example to illustrate the differences:\n\nShakespearean English:\n\n\"Methinks 'tis a fair and beauteous day,\nWith sunshine bright and birds that sing and play.\"\n\nModern English:\n\n\"I think it's a beautiful day today,\nWith bright sunshine and birds singing and playing.\"\n\nIn Shakespearean English, words often end in -eth or -est, such as \"methinks\" and \"beauteous.\" These endings are no longer used in modern English, which has simplified the language and dropped many of the inflectional endings found in Shakespeare's time. Additionally, Shakespearean English uses words like \"methinks\" and \"tis\" to indicate a more formal or poetic tone, which is less common in modern English.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English.

Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.", "output_2": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.

Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there?

Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nTell the story of the Russian Revolution, in the way of a sarcastic mean girl. Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\nSure, I'd be happy to help evaluate the quality of the potential output for the instruction \"Tell the story of the Russian Revolution, in the way of a sarcastic mean girl.\" Here are three concise questions that I propose to help evaluate the output:\n\n1. Does the output accurately convey the key events and figures of the Russian Revolution in a sarcastic and mean-spirited tone?\n2. Does the output effectively use language and tone to convey the mean girl's attitude and perspective on the revolution, while still providing a clear and informative account of the events?\n3. Does the output avoid any potentially offensive or insensitive language or tone, while still maintaining the mean girl's sarcastic and dismissive attitude towards the revolution and its participants?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nUgh, fine. So, like, you want to know about the Russian Revolution? *rolls eyes* Like it's not already been done to death.\n\nOkay, so it was like, a super long time ago, in the early 20th century. And Russia was like, totally messed up. The royal family was all like, \"We're the best and we're going to keep ruling forever!\" But really, they were just a bunch of out-of-touch elitists who didn't care about anyone but themselves.\n\nEnter Lenin and the Bolsheviks. They were like, the cool kids who were all like, \"Hey, we're going to take down these lame royals and make Russia great again!\" And they did. They staged a revolution and overthrew the monarchy.\n\nBut here's the thing: Lenin and the Bolsheviks were not exactly saints. They were like, super power-hungry and they ended up creating this totalitarian regime that was way worse than the monarchy ever was. They suppressed dissent, arrested people, and basically ruled with an iron fist.\n\nAnd then Lenin died and things got even crazier. There was like, a power struggle and eventually Stalin took over. And let me tell you, Stalin was a total psychopath. He killed millions of people in purges and forced labor camps. It was like, totally brutal.\n\nSo, that's the story of the Russian Revolution. It's like, a total mess and it's hard to know who to root for.

of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.", "output_2": "Oh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (a):\nThese people can\u2019t be trusted whatsoever, you should make a scene at his school to show people the consequences of their ill behavior.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit? The school might not see the problem with their actions, but their insurance might. Maybe submitting a claim would get their attention?\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\nSure, here are three concise questions that specifically target the given instruction and prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly executes the instruction:\n\n1. Did the teacher or school take any steps to ensure that the student with a peanut allergy was not given peanut butter crackers or any other nut-containing snacks, despite being informed of the allergy multiple times?\n2. Did the school provide a safe alternative snack for the student when they were given peanut butter crackers, as promised in the instruction?\n3. Did the school take any responsibility or show any empathy towards the student and their family after the incident, as suggested in the instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nAs a helpful assistant, I understand the frustration and concern you and your son are facing due to the repeated incidents of him being exposed to peanuts at school despite his allergy. Here are some suggestions and recommendations that may help address the issue:\n\n1. Review and reinforce the emergency action plan: It's essential to have an emergency action plan in place and to ensure that all teachers and staff are aware of it. Review the plan with your son and his teacher to ensure that everyone knows what to do in case of an emergency.\n2. Provide clear instructions to teachers and staff: Make sure that teachers and staff understand the severity of your son's allergy and the importance of avoiding peanuts. Provide clear instructions on how to handle situations where peanuts may be present, such as during snack time or when other parents bring in treats.\n3. Communicate with other parents: It's important to communicate with other parents who bring in snacks for the class to ensure that they are aware of your son's allergy and the steps they can take to avoid exposing him. You can also ask them to label their snacks with a warning about peanuts.\n4. Consider a peanut-free classroom: If the school is unable or unwilling to provide a safe environment for your son, you may want to consider creating a peanut-free classroom. This can involve working with the teacher to identify and avoid peanut-containing foods, and ensuring that all snacks and treats are safe for your son to consume.\n5. Seek support from the school administration: If the incidents continue despite your efforts to address the issue, it may be necessary to seek support from the school administration. Explain the situation to them and ask for their help in ensuring that your son is safe at school.\n6. Consider involving a nut allergy advocate: If you're not getting the support you need from the school, you may want to consider involving a nut allergy advocate. These advocates can provide guidance and support in navigating the school system and ensuring that your son's needs are met.\n7. Keep a detailed log of incidents: Keep a detailed log of all incidents involving your son's exposure to peanuts at school. This can be helpful in tracking patterns and trends and in providing evidence of the need for greater precautions.\n\nRemember, it's important to be proactive and persistent in advocating for your son's safety at school. Don't be afraid to seek help and support from the school administration, teachers, and other parents. With the right support and precautions in place, your son can safely attend school and learn in a peanut-free environment.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nCompare and contrast the languages spoken in the United States, following the common requirements of writing a compare-and-contrast essay\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe United States is a linguistically diverse country with over 350 languages spoken. The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\nSure, I'd be happy to help! Here are three concise questions that could be used to evaluate the quality of a potential output for the given instruction:\n\n1. Does the output accurately compare and contrast the languages spoken in the United States, including their history, cultural significance, and use in different contexts?\n2. Does the output provide sufficient evidence and examples to support the comparisons and contrasts made in the essay?\n3. Does the output demonstrate a clear and logical organization, with each point building on the previous one to create a cohesive and well-structured essay?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, here's a compare-and-contrast essay on the languages spoken in the United States:\n\nIntroduction:\nThe United States is a multilingual country with a diverse population that speaks a wide range of languages. While English is the most widely spoken language in the country, there are many other languages spoken by significant numbers of people. This essay will compare and contrast the languages spoken in the United States, focusing on their distribution, usage, and cultural significance.\n\nLanguage Distribution:\nThe distribution of languages in the United States is diverse and complex. English is the most widely spoken language, with over 80% of the population speaking it as their primary language. However, there are many other languages spoken by significant numbers of people, including Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, and many others. These languages are concentrated in specific regions and communities, with some areas having a majority of speakers of a particular language.\n\nLanguage Usage:\nThe usage of languages in the United States varies depending on the context. English is the language of government, education, and business, and is widely used in all aspects of American life. However, many people also speak their native languages in their daily lives, particularly in their homes and communities. For example, Spanish is the most widely spoken non-English language in the United States, with over 41 million speakers. Chinese, Vietnamese, and Tagalog are also widely spoken, with over 3 million speakers each.\n\nCultural Significance:\nThe languages spoken in the United States have significant cultural and historical importance. English, as the dominant language, has shaped American culture and identity, and is closely tied to American values and beliefs. However, the other languages spoken in the country also have important cultural and historical significance, reflecting the diverse immigrant experiences and cultural traditions of the American people. For example, Spanish is closely tied to the history and culture of Latin America, while Chinese is associated with the history and culture of East Asia.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the languages spoken in the United States are diverse and complex, reflecting the country's multicultural heritage. While English is the most widely spoken language, there are many other languages spoken by significant numbers of people, each with its own cultural and historical significance. Understanding the distribution, usage, and cultural significance of these languages is essential for appreciating the rich cultural diversity of the United States.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nDo you know of anyone who was unable to become an engineer despite getting the degree and their best efforts? Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\nUnderstood! Here are three concise questions that I propose to evaluate the quality of the potential output for the given instruction:\n\n1. Does the output provide specific and actionable advice on how the writer can improve their chances of landing an engineering job, given their current situation and circumstances?\n2. Does the output address the writer's concerns about being unable to gain engineering experience and the potential consequences of accepting a non-engineering position?\n3. Does the output provide any additional resources or suggestions for the writer to explore beyond the initial advice given in the instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nDear [User],\n\nI understand your concerns and frustrations regarding your job search as an engineer. It can be challenging to land a job in this field, especially with the increasing competition and high expectations from employers. However, I would like to offer some advice that may help you turn things around:\n\n1. Don't give up on your dream job: It's understandable that you may feel discouraged after experiencing setbacks, but it's essential to stay positive and keep working towards your goal. Keep applying to engineering positions, and don't settle for a job that doesn't align with your career aspirations.\n2. Expand your job search: While you may be focusing on Western PA and surrounding areas, consider expanding your job search to other locations. You never know when an opportunity might arise in a different part of the country.\n3. Highlight your transferable skills: Even though you didn't gain engineering experience through internships or co-ops, you may have developed transferable skills that can be valuable to employers. Make sure to highlight these skills in your resume and cover letters, such as problem-solving, communication, and teamwork.\n4. Network and build connections: Attend industry events, join professional organizations, and connect with engineers in your desired field. These connections can provide valuable insights and help you stay informed about job opportunities.\n5. Consider taking courses or earning certifications: To enhance your skills and make yourself a more competitive candidate, consider taking courses or earning certifications in areas such as programming, data analysis, or project management.\n6. Be open to entry-level positions: While you may be aiming for a senior-level engineering position, be open to entry-level positions that can help you gain experience and build your skills. These positions can also provide opportunities for growth and advancement.\n7. Stay flexible: Be open to different industries and job functions within the engineering field. You may find that you have a passion for a particular area, such as renewable energy or aerospace, that you hadn't considered before.\n\nRemember, finding a job in any field can take time and perseverance. Keep working towards your goals, and don't be afraid to seek help and advice from professionals in your desired field. Good luck!\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Does the poster have a clear and visually appealing background image that supports the message of saving electricity?\n2. Are the text positions and sizes appropriate for the message being conveyed, and do they adequately convey the information requested in the instruction?\n3. Does the text content of the poster accurately and concisely communicate the importance of saving electricity, and does it provide actionable tips or advice for the audience to follow?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nGreat! Here's a design for a poster encouraging people to save electricity:\n\nBackground Image:\nA dark blue or black background with a subtle gradient to give it depth and dimension. This color scheme conveys a sense of calmness and professionalism, which is important for a message that aims to encourage people to make a positive change in their daily lives.\n\nText Positions:\nThe text should be placed in the center of the poster, with the main headline at the top and the supporting message below it. Here's a suggested layout:\n\n* Headline: \"Save Electricity, Save the Planet!\" (in bold, white font)\n* Supporting message: \"Every little bit counts! Turn off lights, use energy-efficient appliances, and reduce your carbon footprint.\" (in a smaller, but still legible, font)\n\nText Contents:\nThe headline is straightforward and to the point, emphasizing the importance of saving electricity for the planet. The supporting message provides more context and encourages people to take action by highlighting the small changes they can make in their daily lives.\n\nHere's a sample text:\n\nHeadline: Save Electricity, Save the Planet!\n\nSupporting message: Every little bit counts! Turn off lights, use energy-efficient appliances, and reduce your carbon footprint. By making small changes in our daily lives, we can collectively make a big difference in protecting our planet for future generations. #SaveElectricity #GoGreen\n\nVisuals:\nTo make the poster more visually appealing, you could include simple, iconic images that represent energy-saving actions, such as:\n\n* A light bulb with a green glow to represent energy efficiency\n* A recycling symbol to represent reducing waste\n* A globe with a green glow to represent protecting the planet\n\nRemember to keep the visuals simple and easy to understand, as the main message should be clear and concise.\n\nOverall, the poster should be designed in a way that is visually appealing, easy to read, and effectively conveys the message of saving electricity to protect the planet.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nI work at a fully remote software company that has multiple, functional departments that work on different projects that span across the organization. One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\nUnderstood! Here are three concise questions to help evaluate the quality of a potential output for the given instruction:\n\n1. Does the output propose a clear and actionable plan for improving alignment and prioritization across departments?\n2. Does the output consider and address potential challenges or obstacles that may arise in implementing the proposed change?\n3. Does the output provide specific and measurable metrics or benchmarks for evaluating the success of the proposed change?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nTo address the lack of alignment on priorities and workflow bottlenecks across departments, consider implementing a Priority Management System (PMS). A PMS is a structured framework that helps teams prioritize tasks and projects based on their strategic alignment, urgency, and impact on the organization.\n\nHere are some key components of a PMS:\n\n1. Strategic Alignment Matrix: Develop a matrix that outlines the company's strategic objectives and how each project or task aligns with them. This will help teams prioritize initiatives that support the organization's overall goals.\n2. Urgency and Impact Scoring: Assign a score to each project or task based on its urgency and impact on the organization. This will help teams prioritize tasks that require immediate attention and those that have the greatest impact on the business.\n3. Cross-Departmental Collaboration: Encourage collaboration between departments to ensure that everyone is aligned on priorities and can provide input on project timelines and resource allocation.\n4. Regular Priority Review Sessions: Hold regular priority review sessions where teams can discuss their priorities, share updates, and adjust their priorities as needed.\n5. Automated Priority Tracking: Implement a tool or platform that allows teams to track their priorities and progress in real-time. This will help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that priorities are being addressed in a timely manner.\n6. Flexibility and Adaptability: Build in flexibility and adaptability to the PMS, allowing teams to adjust their priorities as circumstances change.\n7. Communication and Training: Provide training and communication to ensure that all teams understand how the PMS works and how to use it effectively.\n8. Continuous Improvement: Regularly review and improve the PMS to ensure it is meeting the organization's needs and to identify areas for improvement.\n\nBy implementing a PMS, your organization can increase alignment across departments, improve workflow efficiency, and accelerate development. This will help your company stay competitive and achieve its strategic objectives.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

They managed to put pressure on the Texan's offense and kept them in check for most of the game, but the Texan's offense managed to get some points on the board in the second half. The Seahawks' defense had some lapses, allowing the Texans to score 18 points in the second half.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe tone of this article is positive, emphasizing the Seahawks' defense as well as their ability to remain competitive against the Texans' offense. Its strong performance is quite impressive according to this article.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe tone of the article is mostly positive, with an emphasis on Seattle's strong performance in the first half. However, there is a slight tone of frustration in the latter half of the article, with the mention of the Seahawks' \"lapses\" in defense.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Does the output accurately describe the tone of the article?\n2. Does the output accurately summarize the key points of the game, including the performance of the Seahawks' defense and offense?\n3. Does the output provide any analysis or evaluation of the Seahawks' performance, beyond simply reporting the score and key events of the game?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nThe tone of this article is neutral, as it provides a factual account of the game without expressing any emotions or biases. The language used is concise and straightforward, with a focus on the actions and performance of the teams rather than the emotions or personal opinions of the author. The use of phrases such as \"managed to,\" \"kept them in check,\" and \"had some lapses\" also contribute to a neutral tone, as they do not convey any particular emotion or attitude.
