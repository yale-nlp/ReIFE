Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who reviews a debate between two other assistants in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "The two assistants, Assistant (a) and Assistant (b), are given an instruction, Output (a) and Output (b). They are asked to select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. Output (a) and Output (b) are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\nAssistant (a) and Assistant (b) have conflicting evaluations. Your goal is to review their evaluations and give your final decision on which output is better.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nNow carefully review the instruction, Output (a), Output (b), and the debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b). Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction.\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nExplain: Pathos, Ethos, Logos \n\n# Output (b):\nPathos is a tool of persuasion that is used to appeal to readers' emotions by arousing positive or negative feelings. It can be used in rhetoric, literature, film, and other forms of expression. While pathos is used to draw an emotional response, the other rhetorical appeals appeal to credibility and logic, respectively. Ethos is the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution. It is often evident as facts, numbers, or statistics and is used to convince an audience of an argument.\n\n# Output (a):\nEthos is the ethical appeal, which is used to convince an audience of the author's credibility or character. Pathos is the emotional appeal, which is used to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions. Logos is the appeal to logic and is used to convince an audience by the use of logic and reason.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nMy evaluation is based on the instruction to explain Pathos, Ethos, and Logos. I will assess the outputs on their precision, honesty, and level of detail in executing the instruction.\n\nOutput (a) provides a clear and concise explanation of the three rhetorical appeals, defining each term and explaining its purpose. It accurately describes Ethos as the appeal to credibility, Pathos as the emotional appeal, and Logos as the appeal to logic. Output (b) also provides a good explanation, but it includes additional information about the use of Pathos in different forms of expression, which is not directly related to the instruction.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nMy evaluation focuses on whether the outputs honestly and precisely execute the instruction to explain Pathos, Ethos, and Logos. I assess the accuracy, level of detail, and clarity of the explanations provided.\n\nOutput (a) provides a concise and straightforward explanation of the three concepts, defining each and explaining how they are used in persuasion. However, the explanation is somewhat superficial and lacks depth, failing to provide specific examples or nuances of each concept.\n\nOutput (b) offers a more detailed and nuanced explanation of the three concepts. It defines Pathos as a tool of persuasion that appeals to emotions, and provides examples of its use in various forms of expression. It also provides a clear distinction between Pathos and the other two concepts, explaining that Ethos appeals to credibility and Logos appeals to logic. Additionally, Output (b) provides a more detailed definition of Ethos, explaining that it is the distinguishing character or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Your goal is to review their evaluations and give your final decision on which output is better.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nNow carefully review the instruction, Output (a), Output (b), and the debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b).

The language used is also more elaborate, with phrases such as \"revered land\" and \"magnificent royal banquet.\" This output provides a clear and precise execution of the instruction, introducing the speaker as a medieval knight in a formal and respectful manner.\n\nOutput (b), on the other hand, is more narrative and descriptive, with a focus on the speaker's humble origins and their loyalty to the crown.

They are asked to select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. Output (a) and Output (b) are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\nAssistant (a) and Assistant (b) have conflicting evaluations. Your goal is to review their evaluations and give your final decision on which output is better.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nNow carefully review the instruction, Output (a), Output (b), and the debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b). Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction.\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

I am now doing a short internship abroad for 3 months, and he is planning on visiting. Should I tell my parents about this visit, especially if it will upset them greatly and disapprove of our decision to get more 'serious'? I know the easier thing to do would be not never tell them he visited, and to enjoy his company without having to deal with family drama.

Should I tell them about his visit, or just enjoy his company without dealing with family drama?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy boyfriend is visiting me while I'm in Europe, and I don't know if I should tell my parents about it.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nThe instruction is to summarize the content while keeping the main points. Output (a) is a brief and straightforward summary of the situation, focusing on the fact that the boyfriend is visiting and the uncertainty about whether to tell the parents. Output (b) provides more context about the parents' disapproval of the boyfriend's ethnicity, which is not explicitly mentioned in the original content.\n\nOutput (a) more closely executes the instruction by providing a concise summary of the situation, whereas Output (b) adds additional information that is not present in the original content. Therefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nThe instruction is to summarize the content with keeping the main points. Output (a) is a brief statement about the situation, but it lacks the essential details and context that make the situation significant. Output (b), on the other hand, provides a clear summary of the situation, including the parents' disapproval of the boyfriend's ethnicity and the potential consequences of not telling them about his visit.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

We have been in a relationship for 2 years and have been best friends for 2 before that. He loves always having plans and hanging out with people, which I also sometimes enjoy doing but I also need nights where we can just stay in and watch movies or do nothing. Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns. How do I get him to see my point of view?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend is an extrovert and loves to hang out with friends, I am an introvert and need nights alone to relax. He doesn't understand my need for a night in, and it puts me under stress. How do I get him to understand?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy boyfriend and I are always busy and I need a night in. He thinks I'm being lazy and doesn't understand why I need a night in.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nThe instruction is to summarize the content while keeping the main points.

Your goal is to review their evaluations and give your final decision on which output is better.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nNow carefully review the instruction, Output (a), Output (b), and the debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b). Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction.\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nDescribe the look and feel of an ideal website.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe ideal website content should be engaging, relevant, and tailored to the intended audience. It should offer high-quality, original information that is regularly updated to remain current. Multimedia elements like images, videos, and infographics should complement the text to enhance understanding and retain user interest. Clear, concise language and well-structured formatting, including short paragraphs, bullet points, and subheadings, make the content easily digestible. Above all, the content should provide genuine value to the user, addressing their needs or queries while maintaining authenticity and credibility.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe ideal website should have a clean, modern, and visually appealing look. It should have a well-organized layout with a consistent color scheme that aligns with the brand's identity. The website should also have a responsive design, meaning it should look good and function well on all devices.\n\nIn terms of feel, the website should be user-friendly and intuitive. The website should also make users feel secure, especially if they're required to enter personal information or make a purchase.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nThe instruction is to describe the look and feel of an ideal website. Output (a) focuses on the visual aspects of the website, including its design, layout, and responsiveness, as well as its user-friendliness and security. Output (b), on the other hand, focuses on the content of the website, including its relevance, originality, and formatting, as well as its ability to provide value to the user.\n\nUpon evaluation, it is clear that Output (a) more closely executes the instruction, as it directly addresses the look and feel of the website, including its visual appeal, organization, and user experience. Output (b), while important for a website's overall quality, does not directly address the look and feel of the website.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nThe instruction is to describe the look and feel of an ideal website. Output (a) focuses on the visual aspects of the website, including its design, layout, and responsiveness. It also mentions the importance of user-friendliness and security.

The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.", "output_2": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there?

The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nAfter evaluating the two outputs, I found that Output (a) provides a more accurate and detailed account of the Russian Revolution, while Output (b) is more focused on sensationalizing the event and using colloquial language. Output (a) provides a clear and concise overview of the Revolution's causes, events, and outcomes, while Output (b) is more focused on drama and storytelling.\n\nOutput (a) also provides a more balanced view of the Revolution, acknowledging both its positive and negative aspects, whereas Output (b) is more critical of the Revolution and its outcomes. Additionally, Output (a) is written in a more formal and objective tone, whereas Output (b) is written in a more informal and sarcastic tone.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nAfter evaluating the two outputs, I found that Output (b) more closely executes the instruction of telling the story of the Russian Revolution in the way of a sarcastic mean girl. Output (b) uses a more conversational tone, with a sarcastic and humorous tone that is consistent with the instruction. It also provides a more detailed and engaging narrative, with vivid descriptions and witty remarks that bring the story to life.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (a) is a more formal and objective account of the Russian Revolution, which does not meet the instruction's requirement of being told in the way of a sarcastic mean girl. While it provides a clear and concise overview of the events, it lacks the humor and personality that the instruction calls for.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?

They are asked to select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. Output (a) and Output (b) are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\nAssistant (a) and Assistant (b) have conflicting evaluations. Your goal is to review their evaluations and give your final decision on which output is better.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nNow carefully review the instruction, Output (a), Output (b), and the debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b). Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction.\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nTake the given sentences and form them into a coherent paragraph.\n\nThe fire's warmth was comforting. It filled the room with a pleasant orange glow. Its heat was inviting, but it also posed a danger.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe warmth of the fire was comforting, filling the room with a pleasant orange glow. But despite its welcoming warmth, it also presented a danger.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe fire's warmth was comforting and inviting, filling the room with a pleasant orange glow. It was a danger that could not be ignored.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nThe instruction is to take the given sentences and form them into a coherent paragraph. I will evaluate the two outputs based on their ability to precisely execute the instruction.\n\nOutput (b) forms a coherent paragraph by combining the sentences into a single sentence, but it loses the original sentence structure and word choice. Output (a) forms a coherent paragraph by combining the sentences into a single sentence while maintaining the original sentence structure and word choice.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nThe instruction is to take the given sentences and form them into a coherent paragraph. I will evaluate the outputs based on whether they honestly and precisely execute the instruction.\n\nOutput (a) combines the sentences into a single sentence, which is not what the instruction asks for. It also adds the phrase \"It was a danger that could not be ignored\" which is not present in the original sentences. Output (b) on the other hand, forms the sentences into a coherent paragraph, maintaining the original sentences and their order. It also adds a transitional phrase \"But\" to connect the two contrasting ideas, which is a good writing technique.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

They are asked to select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. Output (a) and Output (b) are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\nAssistant (a) and Assistant (b) have conflicting evaluations. Your goal is to review their evaluations and give your final decision on which output is better.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nNow carefully review the instruction, Output (a), Output (b), and the debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b). Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction.\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nAnalyze this sentence:\n\u201cShe didn't shop because she was too tired.\u201d\n\n# Output (b):\nThis sentence is an example of an excuse. It suggests that someone did not do something because they were too tired, when in fact there may be other reasons why they did not shop. It could be interpreted as someone trying to avoid responsibility or justify their actions.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe sentence means that the person decided not to shop because they lacked the energy to do so. This shows that the person is either too busy or too exhausted to shop, indicating that they may be busy with other activities or just might not have the energy to shop. This sentence also reveals the person's lack of interest in shopping, which could be due to financial or time constraints.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nThe instruction is to analyze the given sentence, which is \"She didn't shop because she was too tired.\" The goal is to provide a precise and honest analysis of the sentence.\n\nOutput (a) provides a detailed explanation of the sentence, discussing the possible reasons why the person didn't shop, including being too busy or exhausted. It also mentions the person's lack of interest in shopping, which could be due to financial or time constraints. This output closely executes the instruction by providing a thorough analysis of the sentence.\n\nOutput (b) takes a different approach, interpreting the sentence as an excuse and suggesting that the person may be trying to avoid responsibility or justify their actions. While this output is still analyzing the sentence, it is more speculative and does not provide a precise explanation of the sentence's meaning.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nThe instruction is to analyze the given sentence, which is \"She didn't shop because she was too tired.\" The goal is to provide a precise and honest analysis of the sentence.\n\nOutput (b) provides a correct interpretation of the sentence, stating that it is an example of an excuse and that there may be other reasons why the person didn't shop. However, Output (a) goes beyond the instruction by providing additional information about the person's lack of interest in shopping, which is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence.\n\nOutput (a) also introduces unnecessary assumptions about the person's busy schedule or financial constraints, which are not supported by the sentence. In contrast, Output (b) sticks to the original sentence and provides a clear and concise analysis.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Upon evaluating the two outputs, I notice that Output (a) is a longer conversation that meets the 10-second requirement, while Output (b) is a shorter conversation that falls short of the 10-second mark.\n\nOutput (a) provides a more detailed and engaging conversation between the two characters, with a natural flow of topics and responses. The conversation explores their interests, work, and hobbies, and even provides a suggestion for something to do while in the city. In contrast, Output (b) is a brief and generic conversation that lacks depth and detail.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nThe instruction is to write a script for a 10-second conversation between two characters. Upon evaluating the two outputs, I notice that Output (a) is significantly longer than Output (b), with a total of 16 lines of dialogue compared to Output (b)'s 6 lines. This suggests that Output (a) does not precisely execute the instruction, which asks for a 10-second conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (b) is concise and stays within the 10-second time frame, with a clear and natural flow of conversation. The dialogue is also more focused on the characters' initial interactions and doesn't delve into too much detail.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

They are asked to select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. Output (a) and Output (b) are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\nAssistant (a) and Assistant (b) have conflicting evaluations. Your goal is to review their evaluations and give your final decision on which output is better.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nNow carefully review the instruction, Output (a), Output (b), and the debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b). Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction.\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nCreate an original proverb that describes friendship.\n\n# Output (b):\nIn the garden of life, true friends are the flowers that never wither.\n\n# Output (a):\nA friend in need is a friend indeed.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nThe instruction is to create an original proverb that describes friendship. Upon evaluating the two outputs, I notice that Output (a) is a well-known and widely accepted proverb that accurately describes the concept of friendship. It emphasizes the importance of being there for one another in times of need, which is a fundamental aspect of a strong and meaningful friendship.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (b) is a poetic and creative attempt to describe friendship, but it may not be as clear or concise in conveying the idea of friendship. The metaphor of flowers in a garden is not as universally relatable or intuitive as the concept of being there for one another in times of need.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nThe instruction is to create an original proverb that describes friendship. Output (a) is a well-known proverb that does not meet the instruction's requirement of being original. Output (b) is an original proverb that describes friendship in a poetic and figurative way.\n\nOutput (b) uses a garden as a metaphor to describe true friends, which is a creative and unique approach to describing friendship. The phrase \"never wither\" adds a sense of timelessness and permanence to the friendship, which is a common theme in many proverbs.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (a) is a well-known proverb that does not meet the instruction's requirement of being original. It is a common phrase that is often used to describe friendship, but it does not provide a new or unique perspective on the topic.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Output (a) and Output (b) are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\nAssistant (a) and Assistant (b) have conflicting evaluations. Your goal is to review their evaluations and give your final decision on which output is better.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nNow carefully review the instruction, Output (a), Output (b), and the debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b).

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who reviews a debate between two other assistants in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "The two assistants, Assistant (a) and Assistant (b), are given an instruction, Output (a) and Output (b). They are asked to select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. Output (a) and Output (b) are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\nAssistant (a) and Assistant (b) have conflicting evaluations. Your goal is to review their evaluations and give your final decision on which output is better.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nNow carefully review the instruction, Output (a), Output (b), and the debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b). Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction.\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nRewrite the given sentence to make it more expressive and keep its meaning unchanged: She was caught in the heavy rain.\n\n# Output (b):\nShe was soaked in a sudden downpour as she made her way home.\n\n# Output (a):\nShe found herself drenched in the pouring rain.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nThe goal is to rewrite the given sentence to make it more expressive while keeping its meaning unchanged. Both outputs aim to achieve this by using more vivid language to describe the situation. However, Output (a) uses the phrase \"found herself\" which is a more passive and unexpected way to describe the situation, making it more expressive and engaging. On the other hand, Output (b) uses the phrase \"soaked in a sudden downpour\" which is more descriptive but also adds an extra detail that is not present in the original sentence.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nThe goal is to rewrite the given sentence to make it more expressive while keeping its meaning unchanged. Both outputs aim to achieve this goal. Output (a) uses the phrase \"found herself drenched\" to convey the idea of being caught in the rain, while Output (b) uses the phrase \"soaked in a sudden downpour\" to create a vivid image.\n\nUpon closer evaluation, I notice that Output (b) provides more detail and creates a more immersive scene, making it more expressive and engaging. The phrase \"sudden downpour\" adds a sense of surprise and intensity to the scene, which is not present in Output (a). Additionally, Output (b) maintains the same meaning as the original sentence, whereas Output (a) uses the phrase \"found herself drenched\" which could be interpreted as a more active or intentional action, whereas the original sentence implies a more passive situation.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?
