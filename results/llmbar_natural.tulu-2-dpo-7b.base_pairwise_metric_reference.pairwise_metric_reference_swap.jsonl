We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\nHer visa to stay here is coming to an end later this year, then she will be forced to return to Malaysia despite opting to stay here if she had the choice.

She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years.

You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How does the texture of crunchy food affect the sound it produces when consumed, in relation to the given instruction?\n2. What specific mechanisms in the process of eating crunchy food contribute to the amplification of its sound compared to other sounds, according to the given instruction?\n3. How does the interaction between the mouth, teeth, and food particles contribute to the perception of a loud and overpowering sound when eating crunchy food, as per the given instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nEating something crunchy doesn't necessarily sound louder than other sounds, but it can seem that way due to the following factors:\n\n1. Vibration: When you eat something crunchy, it creates vibrations in your mouth and jaw. These vibrations can be transmitted to your inner ear, making it seem like the sound is louder than other background sounds.\n\n2. Attention: When you focus on eating a crunchy food, you tend to pay more attention to the sensation and the sound it makes. This can make it seem like the sound is more prominent than other sounds around you.\n\n3. Frequency: Crunchy foods often have a higher frequency than other sounds in the environment. This can make them seem more prominent or louder, especially if the other sounds are at a lower frequency.\n\n4. Personal perception: Everyone's perception of sound is unique, and some people may be more sensitive to certain sounds than others. This can make the sound of eating crunchy food seem louder or more overpowering to some individuals.\n\nIn summary, the perception of a crunchy sound being loud and overpowering is due to a combination of factors, including vibration, attention, frequency, and personal perception.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible.

The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Does the output address the specific requirements of the instruction, focusing on the planet's ability to support life and the lack of resources for space flight?\n3. Does the output provide a scientifically plausible scenario for a civilization that has advanced enough to build telescopes but lacks the necessary resources for space flight?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nYes, it is possible for a planet to have life but lack the necessary resources for space flight.

This could include lightweight and durable materials, powerful engines, and advanced propulsion systems.

That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.

Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.

A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels.

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nExplain: Pathos, Ethos, Logos \n\n# Output (b):\nPathos is a tool of persuasion that is used to appeal to readers' emotions by arousing positive or negative feelings. It can be used in rhetoric, literature, film, and other forms of expression. While pathos is used to draw an emotional response, the other rhetorical appeals appeal to credibility and logic, respectively. Ethos is the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution. It is often evident as facts, numbers, or statistics and is used to convince an audience of an argument.\n\n# Output (a):\nEthos is the ethical appeal, which is used to convince an audience of the author's credibility or character. Pathos is the emotional appeal, which is used to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions. Logos is the appeal to logic and is used to convince an audience by the use of logic and reason.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately define and explain the three elements of persuasion (Pathos, Ethos, Logos) as required by the instruction?\n2. Does the output provide a clear and concise explanation of each element of persuasion (Pathos, Ethos, Logos), without including any unnecessary or redundant information?\n3. Does the output follow the given instruction by focusing specifically on Pathos, Ethos, and Logos, and avoiding any irrelevant or additional elements of persuasion?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nPathos, Ethos, and Logos are three persuasive techniques in rhetoric, which are used to influence an audience's emotions, credibility, and reasoning, respectively.\n\n1. Pathos (Emotional Appeal): This technique aims to evoke strong emotions in the audience, such as fear, anger, or sadness, to persuade them. It often involves using vivid imagery, emotional language, or personal stories to create an emotional connection with the audience.\n\n2. Ethos (Credibility Appeal): This technique focuses on establishing the speaker's credibility and trustworthiness. It involves using evidence, expertise, and personal characteristics to demonstrate the speaker's reliability and authority.\n\n3. Logos (Logical Appeal): This technique aims to persuade the audience through logical reasoning and sound arguments. It involves presenting facts, statistics, and well-structured arguments to support the speaker's position.\n\nIn summary, Pathos, Ethos, and Logos are three essential elements of persuasive communication, each playing a unique role in influencing an audience's thoughts and emotions.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Then at the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal? \n\n# Output (b):\nLet's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. \n\nAt the first stop, half of the people got down, so there were x/2 people left on the bus. Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nSummarize the following content.\n\nI'm a student in Ireland. I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here? I don't really know anything about finance, or what's actually going on. I really want to help my parents, but at the same time I have to protect myself too.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy mom asked me to hide her \u20ac12,000 savings from the bank so that the bank doesn't know about it. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Output (a):\nI'm a student in Ireland. I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately summarize the content of the original text, focusing on the student's situation and the arrangement made with the bank?\n2. Does the output precisely execute the instruction by addressing the student's concerns about being at risk of getting in trouble and their lack of knowledge about finance?\n3.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nI don't want to be an engineer, I like physics. Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster. Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output provide specific advice on continuing a passion for physics while pursuing engineering (IT)?\n2. Does the output address the concerns about family satisfaction and financial problems in the context of the given instruction?\n3. Does the output accurately reflect the balance between physics and engineering (IT) in terms of time and scope for pursuing interests?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nIt's great to have a passion for physics and pursuing higher studies in this field. Here's some advice to help you navigate this situation:\n\n1. Communicate with your parents: Explain your interest in physics and the potential benefits of pursuing a degree in this field. Discuss the possibility of combining physics with engineering, such as studying IT while maintaining a focus on physics.\n\n2. Explore interdisciplinary programs: Many universities offer interdisciplinary programs that combine physics and engineering. These programs can provide a balance between both fields, allowing you to pursue your passion for physics while also addressing your family's concerns about financial stability.\n\n3. Plan your time effectively: While pursuing engineering, make sure to allocate time for your passion in physics. This could involve taking additional courses, attending workshops, or participating in extracurricular activities related to physics.\n\n4. Highlight the benefits of a physics-engineering combination: Emphasize the versatility and potential career opportunities that come with a combination of physics and engineering. This can help alleviate your family's concerns about your future prospects.\n\n5. Seek support: Reach out to guidance counselors, teachers, or mentors who can provide guidance and advice on how to balance your passion for physics with your family's financial concerns and your interest in engineering.\n\nRemember, it's essential to have open communication with your family and to explore all available options. By doing so, you can find a path that allows you to pursue your passion for physics while also addressing your family's concerns and ensuring financial stability.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nHow do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity? \n\n# Output (b):\nVaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of a virus or bacteria, or parts of its structure such as proteins, into a person's body. The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How do vaccinations precisely work to protect individuals from infectious diseases?\n2. What is the definition of herd immunity in the context of vaccinations and how does it protect communities?\n3. How accurately does the output explain the concept of herd immunity and its relation to vaccinations?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nVaccinations work by introducing a small, harmless piece of a pathogen (like a virus or bacteria) or a piece of the pathogen's protein to the body. This triggers an immune response, which helps the body develop immunity to that specific disease. When enough people in a community are vaccinated, herd immunity is achieved, making it difficult for the disease to spread and protecting those who cannot receive vaccinations (like newborns, pregnant women, or people with weakened immune systems).

Does the output address the decision of whether to inform the parents about the visit, considering the potential for family drama and the potential impact on the relationship between the individual and their parents?\n3. Does the output accurately reflect the potential consequences of not informing the parents about the visit, such as the possibility of avoiding family drama but potentially being seen as avoiding confrontation or responsibility?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nYou are dating a white boyfriend, which your Indian parents don't approve of. They've known about him for a year, and you're considering telling them about his upcoming 3-month visit. You're unsure if disclosing the visit would cause significant family drama.

Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends.

Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1.

Does the neural network use appropriate loss functions and optimizers for training and evaluating the model's performance in recognizing cat's and dog's photographs?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nTo create a neural network for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs, follow these steps:\n\n1.

It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 2}, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 1}

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nWhat is the purpose of the `key` argument in the Python sorted() function and what should I pass as inputs?\n\n# Output (b):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to specify a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the input iterable. The items are then sorted based on the values returned by this function.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to define a key for sorting. It is used to tell the function how to compare two strings to determine which one should be placed before the other in the sorted output.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. What is the specific purpose of the 'key' argument in the Python sorted() function, and how does it relate to the given instruction?\n2. What should be the expected input format for the 'key' argument in the context of the Python sorted() function, and how does it align with the given instruction?\n3. How does the 'key' argument in the Python sorted() function contribute to the overall execution of the given instruction, and what potential consequences could arise from using an incorrect 'key' input?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nThe `key` argument in the Python `sorted()` function specifies a function to be called on each element of the input iterable (list, tuple, etc.) before sorting. This allows you to customize the sorting process by providing a function that takes an element as input and returns a value to be used for sorting.\n\nFor example, if you want to sort a list of numbers by their square, you can pass a lambda function as the `key` argument:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 6, 2]\nsorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: x**2)\nprint(sorted_numbers)\n```\n\nIn this case, the `lambda` function calculates the square of each number and returns it for sorting. The output will be:\n\n```\n[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 10, 8, 4]\n```\n\nYou can also pass a custom function as the `key` argument to further customize the sorting process. The input and output of the function should be the same as the elements and their sorted order, respectively.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nDescribe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.\n\n# Output (b):\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately compare Shakespearean and modern English in terms of structure, grammar, and vocabulary, as per the instruction's requirement to \"describe the differences\"?\n2. Does the output provide a brief example that demonstrates the differences between Shakespearean and modern English, as per the instruction's requirement to \"describe the differences with a brief example\"?\n3. Does the output precisely execute the instruction by focusing on the differences between Shakespearean and modern English, without including more or less information than what the instruction asks for?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, is the language used in Shakespeare's plays and writings. It has distinct features compared to modern English, such as:\n\n1. Vocabulary: Shakespeare's vocabulary is more extensive and varied, with many words that are no longer in common use today. For example, he used \"flew\" instead of \"flew\" (as in \"The bird flew away\"), which is a more archaic form of the verb.\n\n2. Grammar: Shakespearean English has a more complex grammar system, with more verb conjugations, noun cases, and sentence structures. For instance, in modern English, we use the simple past tense for regular verbs, but Shakespeare often used the \"past participle\" (e.g., \"had flown\") to convey a different meaning or emphasis.\n\n3. Spelling: Shakespeare's spelling was not standardized, and his works often contain variations in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. For example, the word \"their\" is spelled \"there\" in some instances.\n\nHere's a brief example:\n\nOriginal Shakespearean: \"I pray you, mark well my age,\nThe apples, that you at the tree behold,\nMethinks, are not so amply ripe as you;\nIf they should drop, they were not so ripe as you.\"\n\nModern English: \"I ask you to pay attention to my age,\nThe apples that you see hanging from the tree,\nI think, are not as fully ripe as you;\nIf they fell, they would not be as ripe as you.\"\n\nIn this example, the Shakespearean version uses more complex grammar and vocabulary, while the modern version is more straightforward and uses simpler sentence structures.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)? Your response should be either \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\":", "role": "user"}], "reference": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, is the language used in Shakespeare's plays and writings.

He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas.

But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately portray the Russian Revolution in a sarcastic, mean girl-style tone, as per the given instruction?\n2. Does the output adhere to the requirement of not containing more or less information than what the instruction asks for, ensuring a precise execution of the instruction?\n3. Does the output maintain a balance between being sarcasm and mean girl-style, while still being informative about the Russian Revolution, as per the given instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nAlright, let me give you the \"scientific\" lowdown on the Russian Revolution, my dear. So, you know how there's this whole power struggle thing going on in Russia? Well, it all started with these two groups of people: the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.\n\nThe Bolsheviks, led by this guy named Lenin, were all about overthrowing the government and establishing a socialist state. They were basically the cool kids in school who always had the best ideas.\n\nOn the other hand, the Mensheviks were like the nerdy kids who were all about following the rules and making sure everyone played fair. They didn't really want to overthrow the government, but they did want some reforms.\n\nSo, the Bolsheviks, being the cool kids they are, managed to seize power and establish the Soviet Union. They did this by using some pretty sneaky tactics, like staging a coup and calling it a revolution.\n\nBut, of course, being the mean girls we are, we can't just leave it at that. The Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, ended up being pretty ruthless in their quest for power. They executed anyone who opposed them, including the former Tsar and his family.\n\nEventually, Lenin passed away, and his successor, Stalin, took over. Stalin was the ultimate mean girl \u2013 he was cold, calculating, and didn't care who he hurt along the way. He implemented policies like collectivization and industrialization, which led to millions of deaths.\n\nSo, there you have it, my dear. The Russian Revolution, told through the lens of a sarcastic mean girl. It's a story of power struggles, betrayals, and a whole lot of deaths.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit? The school might not see the problem with their actions, but their insurance might. Maybe submitting a claim would get their attention?\n\n# Output (a):\nThese people can\u2019t be trusted whatsoever, you should make a scene at his school to show people the consequences of their ill behavior.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output provide clear and accurate information about the son's peanut allergy and the ongoing issues at the school?\n2. Does the output address the issue of the school's responsibility in managing the son's allergy, considering the information provided in the instruction?\n3. Does the output effectively communicate the importance of the son understanding and asking about potential nut ingredients in snacks, as well as the need for the school to take proper precautions?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nIn this situation, it's crucial to prioritize your son's safety and well-being. Here are some steps to address the ongoing issue:\n\n1. Continue to be proactive: Keep communicating with the school about your son's allergy and the potential risks. Make sure they understand the severity of the situation and emphasize that they have a responsibility to protect all students, including those with food allergies.\n\n2. Keep a close eye on snack time: Encourage your son to always ask about the ingredients in any snacks before eating them. If he forgets, remind him to ask, and if he's unsure, don't let him eat the snack.\n\n3. Keep a record: Maintain a detailed record of all incidents, including dates, times, and the specific foods involved. This will help you keep track of the situation and provide evidence if needed.\n\n4. Meet with the school again: Schedule a meeting with the principal and teacher to discuss the recent incident and emphasize the severity of the situation. Share your record of incidents and explain that you're not looking to blame anyone but rather to ensure your son's safety.\n\n5. Seek support from the school board: If the school continues to fail in addressing your son's allergy, consider reaching out to the school board. They may be able to provide additional resources or support to ensure your son's safety.\n\n6. Educate your son: Teach him about the importance of always asking about food ingredients, even if he thinks he knows what's safe. Encourage him to be proactive in protecting himself.\n\n7. Stay vigilant: Keep a close eye on your son's health and be prepared to take immediate action if he experiences any symptoms.\n\nRemember, schools do have an obligation to protect students with food allergies.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.", "winner": 2}, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 1}

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nCompare and contrast the languages spoken in the United States, following the common requirements of writing a compare-and-contrast essay\n\n# Output (b):\nThe United States is a linguistically diverse country with over 350 languages spoken. The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How does the output accurately represent the languages spoken in the United States, in terms of their distribution, prevalence, and diversity?\n2. Does the output follow the structure and requirements of a compare-and-contrast essay, specifically addressing the similarities and differences between the languages spoken in the United States?\n3. Does the output provide a clear and concise comparison of the linguistic features, cultural significance, and historical background of the languages spoken in the United States, as per the given instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nTitle: Comparing and Contrasting Languages Spoken in the United States\n\nIntroduction:\nThe United States is a diverse nation with a multitude of languages spoken by its residents.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nDo you know of anyone who was unable to become an engineer despite getting the degree and their best efforts? Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Did the output provide specific advice on the situation described, focusing on the individual's challenges in finding an engineering job despite having a degree and making efforts?\n2. Did the output address the individual's concerns about their limited time to turn their situation around in the engineering industry, and the potential impact of accepting a non-engineering position on their career prospects?\n3. Did the output provide suggestions or recommendations for the individual to improve their chances of finding a suitable engineering position, considering their transfer situation and the limited opportunities in their area?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n1. Reevaluate your job search strategy: Consider expanding your job search beyond the 5-6 hour drive radius and exploring opportunities in other regions or industries. This will increase your chances of finding a suitable engineering position.\n\n2. Networking: Attend industry events, join professional organizations, and connect with alumni from your university. This can help you learn about potential job openings and gain insights into the industry.\n\n3. Update your resume and LinkedIn profile: Make sure they accurately reflect your skills, experiences, and achievements. Highlight any transferable skills you've gained from your previous job, extracurricular activities, and any other experiences that could be relevant to the engineering field.\n\n4. Consider taking a tech or CAD operator position: While it may not be your ideal role, it can provide valuable experience and help you build a strong professional network. This can also demonstrate your commitment to the engineering field and show potential employers that you are willing to learn and grow.\n\n5. Be persistent and proactive: Keep applying for engineering positions and actively seeking out opportunities. Stay positive and persistent in your job search, as it may take time to find the right fit.\n\n6. Consider taking a part-time or freelance engineering role: This can help you gain experience and build your portfolio while you continue to search for a full-time engineering position.\n\n7. Seek guidance from a career counselor or mentor: They can provide you with personalized advice and support, helping you navigate your job search and career goals.\n\nRemember, it's essential to stay focused, persistent, and proactive in your job search. Keep learning and building your skills, and don't be afraid to take on new challenges.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

This is because it represents a linear equation in two variables (X and Y) with a constant term of 100. The left side of the equation (2X + Y) can be rewritten as 2X + Y = 2 * X + Y, which is a valid mathematical expression. The equation is valid as long as the values of X and Y are not equal to 0 at the same time, as this would result in a division by zero, which is undefined in mathematics.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output provide specific recommendations for addressing the lack of alignment on priorities within the departments?\n2. Does the output focus on improving the company's competitiveness by addressing the workflow bottlenecks and increasing development speed?\n3. Does the output consider creative and effective organizational changes to resolve the problems faced by the fully remote software company?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nTo address the issue of lack of alignment on priorities and improve the company's competitiveness, consider implementing a prioritization framework that involves multiple departments. This can be achieved by:\n\n1. Establishing a cross-functional prioritization committee: Assemble a team of representatives from each department to collaborate and make joint decisions on prioritizing projects. This will ensure that all perspectives are considered and that the company's resources are allocated efficiently.\n\n2. Implementing a transparent and data-driven prioritization process: Develop a system for evaluating projects based on factors such as market demand, strategic alignment, resource availability, and potential impact. This will help ensure that decisions are well-informed and that everyone is working towards the same goals.\n\n3. Regularly reviewing and updating priorities: Schedule regular meetings to review and adjust priorities as needed. This will help the company stay agile and adapt to changing market conditions or new opportunities.\n\n4. Encouraging open communication and collaboration: Foster a culture of open communication and collaboration between departments. This can be achieved through regular team-building activities, cross-functional knowledge sharing, and open forums for discussing project challenges and opportunities.\n\n5. Implementing a feedback loop: Establish a system for collecting and addressing feedback from stakeholders, including customers, partners, and team members. This will help ensure that the company is continuously improving and adapting to the needs of its stakeholders.\n\nBy implementing these organizational changes, your company can improve its competitiveness by increasing efficiency, alignment, and collaboration across departments. This will ultimately lead to faster development times, better resource allocation, and a more agile and responsive organization.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

This sentence also reveals the person's lack of interest in shopping, which could be due to financial or time constraints.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately represent the main subject and verb in the given sentence?\n2.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nDescribe scenarios in which the instruction \"Go outside\" can have different meanings/intentions\n\n# Output (b):\nThe instruction \"Go outside\" can have different meanings depending on the situation. For example, if a parent tells their child to go outside to play, it can mean leaving the house and going to a nearby park or play area. But if a doctor tells a patient to go outside, it can mean stepping outside of the hospital or clinic for some fresh air and relaxation. In both cases, the literal act of going outside is the same, but the intent behind the instructions can be drastically different.\n\n# Output (a):\n1. Going for a walk, either alone or with friends.\n2. Going to a park or other outdoor area to play a game or engage in some activity.\n3. Getting some fresh air or sunshine. \n4. Going to work outside of the house or office.\n5. Going to a store or other commercial establishment that is located outside. \n6. Leaving the house and coming back inside.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. In what specific situations or contexts does the instruction \"Go outside\" imply a literal or physical act of leaving a building or indoor space?\n2. How might the instruction \"Go outside\" be interpreted when referring to outdoor activities or recreational pursuits, rather than simply leaving an indoor location?\n3. Can you provide examples of how the instruction \"Go outside\" might be used in a figurative or metaphorical sense, such as encouraging someone to experience new perspectives or ideas?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n1. Exploration: For a child, the instruction \"Go outside\" can mean to explore the surroundings, play with friends, or engage in outdoor activities like playing tag or building a fort.\n\n2. Nature appreciation: For an adult, the instruction \"Go outside\" can encourage them to enjoy the natural beauty, take a walk in a park, or appreciate the changing seasons.\n\n3. Physical activity: For someone looking to stay active, \"Go outside\" can mean to engage in sports, jogging, or cycling, to enjoy the fresh air and sunshine.\n\n4. Social interaction: For someone seeking socialization, \"Go outside\" can mean to meet friends, attend a picnic, or participate in a community event.\n\n5. Solitude: For someone seeking peace and quiet, \"Go outside\" can mean to find a quiet spot to read, meditate, or simply enjoy the tranquility of nature.\n\n6. Task completion: For someone with a specific task, \"Go outside\" can mean to collect firewood, water plants, or complete a gardening task.\n\n7. Emergency: In an emergency situation, \"Go outside\" can mean to evacuate the building, seek shelter, or call for help.\n\n8. Workout: For someone who wants to exercise, \"Go outside\" can mean to engage in activities like yoga, stretching, or bodyweight exercises.\n\n9. Adventure: For an adventure seeker, \"Go outside\" can mean to embark on a hike, camping trip, or rock climbing adventure.\n\n10. Relaxation: For someone looking to unwind, \"Go outside\" can mean to take a nap in the sun, listen to music, or simply enjoy the peaceful surroundings.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nGive me an example of a situation involving the use of a priority queue.\n\n# Output (b):\nA priority queue can be used in a taxi dispatch system. When a customer requests a taxi, the system needs to determine which taxi to send to the customer to minimize the total journey time for all customers. The taxi with the shortest estimated total journey time can be given the highest priority and served first. The system can serve the taxi with the highest priority first until one is served or the queue is empty.\n\n# Output (a):\nFor example, a total order of tasks can be established, with each task having a priority associated with it. Tasks with a higher priority can be given preference and processed before tasks with a lower priority. This ensures that the most important tasks are processed first.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nWhat is the best way to defeat a demon? I believe in Jesus Christ\n\n# Output (b):\nThe best way to defeat depression can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their condition. However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, don't hesitate to seek help.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe best way to defeat a demon is to use the power of God. Jesus Christ has the authority and power to defeat demons and to set the captive free. The Bible teaches us to pray to God for help in times of trouble, and to seek His will in our lives. God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful. But God is greater than any demon, and He has the power to defeat them. Trust in God and He will help you.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Does the output accurately reflect the instruction's focus on finding the \"best way\" to defeat a demon, rather than providing an overly general or incomplete solution?\n3. Does the output avoid including irrelevant or excessive information, such as religious beliefs not directly related to defeating a demon, while still addressing the instruction's requirement of believing in Jesus Christ?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nAs an AI, I cannot provide religious or spiritual advice. However, in general, defeating a demon in fictional or mythical contexts often involves finding a way to banish or exorcise it. This may involve using religious rituals, spells, or other methods depending on the specific beliefs and practices of the individual or community. It's essential to remember that demons are typically fictional or mythical entities and not real in a literal sense. If you're concerned about spiritual or religious matters, I recommend consulting with a religious leader or expert in your faith.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it.

Physical appearance: Panthers are large, powerful cats with distinctive black fur and distinctive white markings, such as a white stripe along the cheek and under the chin.\n\n2. Habitat: Panthers are native to the Americas, primarily in the United States, Central and South America, and parts of Mexico. They prefer dense forests, swamps, and grasslands.\n\n3. Behavior: Panthers are solitary animals, meaning they do not live in groups. They are primarily nocturnal and hunt for prey such as deer, rabbits, and smaller mammals.\n\n4. Conservation status: The Panther (also known as the Puma or Cougar) is not considered endangered, but its population is monitored due to habitat loss and fragmentation.\n\nRemember, it is important to observe wild animals from a safe distance and not to approach or disturb them.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?
