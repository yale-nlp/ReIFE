Output (b) includes additional observations such as the solid calcium carbonate dissolving and a possible change in the color of the solution, which are not mentioned in Output (a).  Explanation and Rationale: Both outputs provide the correct balanced chemical equation and describe the reaction as a double displacement reaction. However, Output (a) is slightly more precise in its description of the reaction type, as it specifically identifies it as a double displacement reaction. Additionally, Output (a) includes the observation of the solution becoming cloudy, which is a direct result of the reaction and not just a possible change in the color of the solution. This observation is more directly related to the reaction itself.

Output (a) prints the common elements after the generator is converted to a list, while Output (b) returns the modified array.  Explanation and Rationale: Output (a) is better because it precisely follows the instruction to find common elements in two arrays without using any extra data structures. It uses a generator, which is a type of iterator in Python, to yield the common elements one by one. This approach does not require any additional memory to store the common elements, as they are generated on-the-fly. In contrast, Output (b) modifies the first input array in place, which could potentially alter the original data. Additionally, Output (b) returns a new array, which technically uses extra data structures (the new array) to store the common elements.
