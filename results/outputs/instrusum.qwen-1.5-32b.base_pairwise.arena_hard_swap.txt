Both answers (a) and (b) provide a good summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. They both mention the same key figures and the role of the United Nations in managing the process. However, Answer (b) is slightly more concise and better organized, making it easier to follow the information. Additionally, Answer (b) correctly refers to the specific zone in the eastern Pacific (Clarion-Clipperton Zone), which adds a level of precision that is missing in Answer (a). Therefore, Answer (b) is better.
