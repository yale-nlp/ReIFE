I also appreciate that Output (a) provides a more balanced view by mentioning that the relationship between locals and immigrants remains peaceful, which is an important aspect to consider. Output (b) does not mention this point, which could give a misleading impression about the situation.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.
General Public:After evaluating the two outputs, I found that both of them provide a summary of the impact of immigrants on Brazilian locals.

Output (b) also mentions these points, but it adds more information that is not directly related to the impact of immigrants on locals, such as the number of visas granted to Haitian families and the uncertainty for non-Haitian immigrants.

General Public:After evaluating the two outputs, I found that Output (a) is more accurate and precise in summarizing Klaus Vella Bardon's stance on abortion.

I agree with the previous referees' arguments that Output (b) is a more accurate summary of the article. However, I would like to add that Output (a) is still a good summary, but it lacks the depth and context provided by Output (b). Output (a) is more focused on the negative impact of the tests, which is an important aspect, but it does not provide a complete picture of the reasons behind the protests.  Therefore, Output (b) is better.
