Output (a) accurately states that the number of thyroid cancer cases found in children after the Fukushima disaster is not related to the nuclear incident, and that the large-scale survey conducted in Japan has never been done before, leading to an increase in detected cases. This output is more concise and clear because it directly states the main points of Professor Suzuki's opinions without repeating information or using unnecessary words.  Output (b) is slightly more verbose and repeats some information, making it less concise. Additionally, it does not explicitly state that the large-scale survey conducted in Japan has never been done before, which is an important point made by Professor Suzuki.  I also agree with the previous referees' arguments that Output (a) uses more precise language, such as "not related to the nuclear incident" and "leading to an increase in detected cases", which makes it easier to understand Professor Suzuki's opinions.

It also mentions the specific initiatives and policies of each party, such as Labour's promise to provide apprenticeships to every school leaver who "gets the grades" and the Liberal Democrats' plan to end the "snobbery" about apprenticeships.  On the other hand, Output (b) is a more limited summary that focuses mainly on the statements of individual politicians, such as David Cameron, Baroness Brady, Ed Miliband, and Nick Clegg. While it does provide some information on the parties' plans, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the different parties' policies and initiatives.

Output (a) clearly states the historical changes in alcohol consumption and provides a clear timeline of the events, making it easier to follow and understand.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.
General Public:After evaluating the two outputs, I found that Output (b) is more precise and closely executes the instruction. Output (b) provides a clear and concise summary of the changes in American alcohol consumption, mentioning the Puritans' approval of drinking, the peak of consumption in 1830, the rise of Prohibition, and the current average consumption of 2.3 gallons of pure alcohol per year. Output (a) is more general and does not provide specific details about the changes in consumption.  Output (b) also provides a clear structure and organization, starting with the early days of drinking in America and ending with the current situation. Output (a) jumps around between different time periods and does not provide a clear narrative.  Therefore, Output (b) is better.|||Scientist:After evaluating the two outputs, I found that Output (b) is more precise and closely executes the instruction.

Therefore, Output (a) is better.|||Critic:After evaluating the two outputs, I agree with the previous referees that Output (a) is more precise and closely executes the instruction. Output (a) provides a detailed explanation of why people have started seeking shelter in Brazil, including the reports of the country's growing economy and job opportunities, the vast border of South America's largest country, and the special treatment given to Haitians. Output (a) also mentions the challenges faced by immigrants, such as the strain on resources and basic medical facilities, and the concerns about a possible health crisis.  Output (b) is more general and does not provide as much detail as Output (a). It only mentions the growing economy and job opportunities as the main reasons for people seeking shelter in Brazil, without providing specific examples or context.  However, I would like to question the previous referees' judgment on the clarity of the sentences in Output (a). While Output (a) provides more detail, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, which may make it harder for readers to follow. On the other hand, Output (b) uses simpler and more concise language, making it easier to understand.  After considering these points, I still believe that Output (a) is the better summary. Its detailed explanation and specific examples provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issue, even if the language is not as clear as Output (b).  Therefore, Output (a) is better.

Therefore, Output (a) is better.|||Critic:After evaluating the two outputs, I found that both outputs provide some relevant information about the influence of the Sky Arts documentary "Lenny Henry's Got The Blues" on Sir Lenny Henry's decision to record an album. However, Output (a) is more precise and closely executes the instruction by directly answering the question and providing specific reasons for the influence. Output (b) provides some relevant information, but does not directly answer the question and includes additional information that is not requested.

It also mentions the annual national reading and numeracy tests, but does not provide any additional information.  I also agree that Output (a) provides a more detailed summary of the curriculum, including the changes in secondary schools and the incorporation of subjects into the six areas of learning and experience. This level of detail is not present in Output (b).  However, I would like to question the previous referees' judgment on the level of detail provided in Output (a). While Output (a) does provide more detail, it is not necessarily more relevant to the instruction. The instruction asks for a summary of the new curriculum for each age group in bullet points, and Output (a) provides that. Output (b) does not provide a clear summary, but it does provide some relevant information.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.
General Public:After evaluating the two outputs, I noticed that Output (a) provides a more comprehensive summary of the new curriculum, covering the introduction of the curriculum, the six areas of learning and experience, and the pioneer schools' approach to implementing the curriculum.

It only mentions a few specific points without providing a broader context.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.|||Scientist:After evaluating the two outputs, I noticed that Output (a) provides a more comprehensive summary of the new curriculum, covering the introduction of the curriculum, the six areas of learning and experience, and the pioneer schools' approach to implementing the curriculum.

Output (a) also provides more accurate information, as it is based on a specific assessment of the eastern Pacific's Clarion-Clipperton Zone, which provides a more concrete estimate of the potential resources available. Output (b) does not provide any specific data or estimates, and instead relies on general statements about the potential benefits of deep sea mining.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.|||Critic:After evaluating the two outputs, I agree with the previous referees that Output (a) is more precise and closely executes the instruction.

General Public:After evaluating the two outputs, I found that Output (a) is more precise and closely executes the instruction. Output (a) provides a clear and concise summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It specifically mentions the estimated 27 billion tonnes of mineral-rich nodules and the types of metals they contain, which is exactly what the instruction asks for.  On the other hand, Output (b) is more general and does not provide as much detail as Output (a). While it mentions the same estimated 27 billion tonnes of mineral-rich rocks, it does not specify the types of metals they contain. Additionally, Output (b) uses more vague language, such as "a wide range of benefits" and "mineral-rich rocks", which does not provide as much clarity as Output (a).  Therefore, Output (a) is better.|||Scientist:After evaluating the two outputs, I found that Output (a) is more precise and closely executes the instruction.
