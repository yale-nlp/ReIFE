General Public: **Evaluation:**    The instruction is to modify the function `greet_customer` to accept and use two parameters. The two outputs generated by the AI chatbots are:    **Output (a):**   ```python   def greet_customer(name, customer):       return "Welcome!" + name + "!"   ```    **Output (b):**   ```python   def greet_customer(name, surname):       return "Welcome!" + name + " " + surname + "!"   ```    In accordance with the rules of evaluation, Output (a) is the better choice. The function `greet_customer` is required to accept and use two parameters, `name` and `customer`. Output (a) precisely executes this instruction by including both parameters in the function definition and using them to personalize the greeting.
