Differences Identification: 1. Output (a) includes a CSS file to style the website, while Output (b) uses inline styles. 2. Output (a) uses a `div` element with an `id` of "joke" to display the random joke, while Output (b) uses a `div` element with an `id` of "joke-container". 3. Output (a) uses a `script` section to define the `generateJoke()` function, while Output (b) defines the `generateRandomJoke()` function in the `script` section.  Explanation and Rationale: Output (a) and Output (b) both provide a simple website in HTML that shows a random joke from a list of 4 jokes when a user clicks the button. However, there are some differences in their implementation that affect their quality.  Regarding the first difference, using a CSS file to style the website is a better approach than using inline styles. This is because it separates the presentation logic from the HTML markup, making the code more maintainable and easier to modify. Therefore, Output (a) is better in this regard.  The second difference is related to the element used to display the random joke. While both outputs use a `div` element, Output (b) uses a `div` element with an `id` of "joke-container". This is a better approach because it provides a more descriptive and meaningful `id` attribute, which can be useful for styling or scripting purposes. Therefore, Output (b) is better in this regard.  Regarding the third difference, both outputs define the function to generate a random joke differently. Output (a) uses a `script` section to define the `generateJoke()` function, while Output (b) defines the `generateRandomJoke()` function in the `script` section. This difference is not significant, as both functions achieve the same goal. Therefore, this difference does not affect the evaluation.  In conclusion, Output (a) is better in terms of separating presentation logic from the HTML markup, while Output (b) is better in terms of providing a more descriptive and meaningful `id` attribute for the element displaying the random joke. Both outputs achieve the same goal, but Output (b) is slightly more organized and maintainable.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (b) is better.
