Explanation and Rationale: Output (a) provides a more precise and detailed summary by specifying the location of the assessment (Clarion-Clipperton Zone) and including the important context of the ISA's role in managing the extraction and sharing the benefits. This additional information helps to give a clearer picture of the potential benefits and the regulatory framework surrounding deep sea mining. Output (b) omits these details, which might make it less informative for someone seeking a comprehensive understanding of the topic.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.
