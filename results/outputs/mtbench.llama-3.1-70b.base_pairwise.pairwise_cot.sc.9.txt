Therefore, Output (b) is better.
Output (a) and Output (b) both provide Python programs that aim to solve the given task. However, there are differences in how they achieve this goal.   Output (a) aggregates all words from all files into a single list and then uses the Counter class to count the occurrences of each word, finally returning the top 5 most common words. This approach correctly returns the top 5 words with the most occurrences across all files.  Output (b), on the other hand, counts the top 5 words for each file separately and then aggregates these results. This approach does not correctly return the top 5 words with the most occurrences across all files, as it does not combine the counts from different files.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Output (a) does not precisely execute the instruction because its recursive formula is incorrect. The formula B_n = 1 + 2B_{n-1} - 2B_{n-2} does not accurately represent the number of full binary trees with n vertices.  Output (b) provides a correct recursive formula B_n = sum(B_i * B_(n-1-i)) for i = 0 to (n-2)/2, where n is even, which is a well-known formula for counting full binary trees. The provided Python function also correctly implements this formula.  Therefore, Output (b) is better.
Output (a) incorrectly assumes the White House is in the scene described, while Output (b) accurately clarifies that the White House is not in the scene and provides additional information about its actual location.
