Output (a) uses "remained incomplete" instead of "had not finished" in the rewritten sentence.  Explanation and Rationale: Both outputs aim to rewrite the original sentence in a more concise way while maintaining the same meaning. Output (b) directly translates the original sentence, replacing "Although he had been studying for several hours he had not finished the task" with "Despite studying for several hours, he had not finished the task". This results in a rewritten sentence that is slightly longer than the original. Output (a), on the other hand, condenses the sentence further by using "hours" instead of "several hours" and "remained incomplete" instead of "had not finished". This change makes the sentence more concise and easier to read.
