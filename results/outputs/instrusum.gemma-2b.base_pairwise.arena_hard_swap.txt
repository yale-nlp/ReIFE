Secret's founders' argument is more compelling than the critics' because it provides a more nuanced understanding of the app's purpose. The founders acknowledge that the app is not just about whistle-blowing, but also about empathy. They also provide evidence to support this claim, such as the fact that the app allows users to share information and feelings anonymously, without the fear of being identified.    Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
**Answer (a) is better.**    The founders of Secret argue that their app is not just about whistle-blowing, but also about empathy. They believe that Facebook has trained users to curate their identity, and that Secret can help train us in empathy. However, some critics argue that the app is simply a marketing gimmick and that promises of anonymity are essentially meaningless.    Secret's founders' argument is more compelling than the critics' argument. The founders provide evidence to support their claim that the app is not just about whistle-blowing, but also about empathy. For example, they cite a study that showed that Secret users were more likely to be empathetic than non-Secret users. Additionally, they argue that the app's privacy policy is more transparent than Facebook's privacy policy.    Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
**Answer (a) is better.**    The founders of Secret argue that their app is not just about whistle-blowing, but also about providing a space for people to express themselves without fear of reprisal. They believe that the app can train people in empathy, allowing them to share feelings that can't be expressed publicly. They also note that while they think about profits, they have not yet invested resources in solving this problem.    The founders' argument is well-reasoned and persuasive. They provide evidence to support their claims, such as the fact that Secret has been a hit with iPhone users in Silicon Valley. They also argue that promises of anonymity are essentially a marketing gimmick, as mobile phones are tied to users in some way or another, and identifiers are often passed to the makers of these applications.    **Therefore, Answer (a) is better.**
**Answer (a) is better.**    The founders of Secret believe that their app provides a platform for users to share information and feelings anonymously, without the fear of being identified. They argue that the intrusion of social networks into our real lives and the Edward Snowden US government spying revelations have led to an increased desire for anonymity on the web. They also suggest that Secret can help train users in empathy, as it allows them to share experiences and emotions that they might not feel comfortable sharing on other social media platforms.    **Explanation:**    * Secret's founders clearly define anonymity as the ability to have a real identity but being able to turn it off when you want to.   * They argue that the app is not just about whistle-blowing, but also about promoting empathy and allowing users to share feelings that they may not be comfortable posting on social media platforms.   * Critics argue that promises of anonymity are essentially a marketing gimmick, as mobile phones are tied to users in some way or another, and identifiers are often passed to the makers of these applications. However, Secret's founders argue that the app is not about sharing personal information, and that users are in control of who they share their information with.    Therefore, Answer (a) is better because it provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the topic.

**Answer (a) is better.**    The solution of building more properties on green belt lands is a more sustainable and long-term solution to London's housing crisis. It would provide much-needed housing for a growing population while preserving green space and protecting the character of the city. Additionally, it would encourage densification and reduce the need for new housing development in areas that are already highly developed.    **Explanation:**    * Building on green belt land would preserve green space and protect the character of London.   * It would provide much-needed housing for a growing population.   * It would encourage densification and reduce the need for new housing development in areas that are already highly developed.   * It would be a sustainable solution that would not put a strain on the environment.    Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
**Answer (a) is better.**    The option of building more properties on green belt lands is a more sustainable and long-term solution to London's housing crisis. By providing more housing options, green belt development would help to:    * Reduce pressure on London's housing market   * Create new jobs and boost the local economy   * Improve air quality and reduce congestion   * Protect the environment by reducing the need for new housing development on greenfield sites    **Explanation:**    * Green belt land is already zoned for housing, so there is no need to acquire additional land.   * Brownfield sites are often contaminated and expensive to clean, so building new housing on these sites can be more cost-effective.   * Building on green belt land would also help to protect the green belt and its biodiversity.    **Therefore, Answer (a) is better.**
