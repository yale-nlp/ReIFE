Additionally, Output (a) uses more descriptive language and provides more contextual information about the people in the article, which helps to enhance the overall quality of the output.  While the other referees have raised valid points about the quality of Output (b), I believe that Output (a) is better due to its more detailed and comprehensive summary of the people in the article. Therefore, I claim that Output (a) is better.  # Alternative solution (If you think the other referees' arguments are not convincing): If I were to provide an alternative solution, I would argue that Output (b) is better because it provides a more general overview of the people in the article, without delving into specific details about each individual. This approach allows the reader to get a sense of the broader context and how the different individuals are affected by the lockdown. Additionally, Output (b) uses more general language and avoids specific details that may not be relevant to the overall summary.  While Output (a) provides more detailed information about each individual, it may not be as relevant to the overall summary of the article. By focusing on the broader context and avoiding specific details, Output (b) provides a more cohesive and comprehensive summary of the people in the article.  Therefore, I would argue that Output (b) is better due to its ability to provide a more general and comprehensive summary of the people in the article.
General Public:  Therefore, after careful evaluation, I conclude that Output (b) is better.

This level of specificity allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the individuals and their perspectives on the second national lockdown.  On the other hand, Output (a) provides a more general overview of the individuals, simply categorizing them as "people from North Norfolk" without delving into their specific identities and roles. While it is important to acknowledge the diversity of opinions and experiences among the population, I believe that providing more detailed information about the individuals can enhance the overall quality of the output.

General Public:  Therefore, Output (b) is better.  In this article, there are two main points that stand out in terms of quality and helpfulness. Firstly, Alex Wilhelm's comment highlights the importance of focusing on results rather than hype, which is a crucial aspect of any business. This point is particularly relevant for Uber and Lyft as they go public, as they will need to demonstrate their ability to generate profits in order to maintain investor confidence. Secondly, Dara Kerr's comment about the potential for price increases for riders suggests that the companies may need to reassess their pricing strategy in order to achieve profitability. This point is useful for understanding the potential challenges that Uber and Lyft may face in the future.

However, after a thorough analysis, I believe that Output (b) is the better of the two.  Output (b) provides a more nuanced explanation for the rise of anonymity apps like Secret and Whisper. It highlights the interplay between the increasing entrenchment of our identities on the web, the Edward Snowden revelations, and the intrusion of social networks into our "real lives" as the primary drivers of the app's popularity. It also acknowledges the potential for these apps to provide a space for people to share feelings and confessions that they may not be comfortable posting on social media, while also recognizing the limitations of promises of anonymity in the context of mobile phones and law enforcement.  In contrast, Output (a) seems to oversimplify the reasons behind the rise of these apps, focusing primarily on the desire for anonymity and the appeal of sharing gossip and corporate secrets.

General Public:  Therefore, Output (b) is better.  In my evaluation, I considered the option of building more properties on green belt land as a solution to London's housing crisis. While this option may provide more homes for Londoners, I believe it is not the best solution for several reasons. Firstly, green belt land is important for recreation purposes and to make a demarcation between settlements, as argued by Ann Goddard. It is crucial to preserve these green spaces for the benefit of the community. Secondly, building on green belt land may lead to the destruction of habitats and ecosystems, which could have negative impacts on the environment and wildlife.  In contrast, Output (a) provides a more thoughtful and sustainable solution by suggesting to differentiate between areas of beauty and intensive farmland within the green belt. This approach recognizes the importance of preserving green spaces while also allowing for more homes to be built in areas where it is feasible and environmentally friendly.

In contrast, Output (a) focuses solely on the idea of downsizing older people to free up accommodation for families, which may not address the broader issue of London's housing crisis or provide a long-term solution to the problem.  Furthermore, Output (b) offers a compromise that could potentially address the concerns of both parties. By differentiating between areas of beauty and intensive farmland within the green belt, Bowman's proposal recognizes the importance of preserving London's natural beauty and the need for a balance between housing supply and environmental protection. This approach is more thoughtful and well-rounded than Output (a), which focuses solely on a single solution without considering the broader context.  Therefore, based on my evaluation, I conclude that "Output (b) is better." END OF Critic Argument
General Public:  Therefore, Output (b) is better.  In my evaluation, I considered the arguments presented in both Output (a) and Output (b). While both outputs acknowledge the need for more housing in London, I believe Output (b) provides a more comprehensive and practical solution to the housing crisis.  Firstly, Output (b) recognizes the importance of differentiating between areas of beauty and intensive farmland within the green belt. This approach would allow for a more targeted and sustainable development of green belt land, rather than blindly building on all green belt areas. By prioritizing the most suitable areas for development, we can minimize the impact on the environment and preserve the green spaces that are essential for Londoners' recreation and well-being.  Secondly, Output (b) proposes a compromise that could be reached by stopping the thinking of the greenbelt as one single unit. This approach would allow for a more nuanced and flexible approach to development, taking into account the unique characteristics of each area within the green belt. By tailoring the development to the specific needs and characteristics of each area, we can ensure that the development is both sustainable and effective in addressing the housing crisis.  In contrast, Output (a) seems to overlook the importance of differentiating between areas of beauty and intensive farmland within the green belt. By simply building on all green belt areas, we risk compromising the environmental and recreational values of these spaces, which are essential for Londoners' quality of life.  In conclusion, while both outputs acknowledge the need for more housing in London, I believe Output (b) provides a more comprehensive and practical solution to the housing crisis.

Balance in analyzing the pros and cons of the new PNR directive.  # Outputs: The two outputs are:  Output (a): The EU is poised to set up a joint system for police and justice officials to access airline passenger data, covering all flights to and from the EU. The need to prevent terrorism, in particular, is cited as justification for it. Passenger Name Record (PNR) data is already collected by airlines but new legislation sets out detailed rules for national authorities to access it when tackling serious crime. The new PNR directive is expected to be passed in the European Parliament on Thursday. Gun and bomb attacks by the Islamic State (IS) group in Paris last year and Brussels this year boosted support for such data monitoring in the EU. What passenger details does PNR cover? When you book a flight the airline routinely collects PNR data, including: names, contact details, itinerary, the credit card used for payment and baggage information. Passport details are also collected, known as the Advance Passenger Information (API). That data is processed for commercial purposes but the plan now is to set up "Passenger Information Units" (PIUs) in each EU member state, where PNR data will be stored. Processing of PNR data to prevent terrorism or other serious crimes will be the responsibility of the new units, not the airlines. The units will pass the data on to law enforcement officials only in such specific cases. The text rules out any processing of data revealing a person's race or ethnic origin, religion, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life. PIUs will be obliged to delete any such data if they receive it to avoid infringing EU anti-discrimination law, embodied in treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
