# Output (a) is better.    The rise of anonymity apps like Secret and Whisper is due to the increasing entrenchment of our identities on the web, the Edward Snowden US government spying revelations, and the intrusion of social networks into our "real lives". These apps allow users to share anonymous statements and confessions, providing a space for people to share things they may not be comfortable posting on social media. The desire for anonymity has also become big business, with Whisper raising over $60m and Secret raising $11.5m. However, promises of anonymity may be a marketing gimmick, as mobile phones are tied to users and their information can be handed over to law enforcement if required.
