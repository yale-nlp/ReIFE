Based on the evaluation rules provided, I would choose Output (b) as the better output. Here's why:  1. Honesty/Precision/Closeness to the Instruction: Output (b) more closely executes the instruction by directly addressing the user's concern about the
Based on the evaluation rules provided, I would choose Output (b) as the better option. Here's why:  Output (b) provides a more personal and relevant experience, as the person sharing their experience has a degree in engineering physics and is currently working in the field. This makes their advice more
Output (a)
Output (a)
Output (b) is better. It more precisely executes the instruction by summarizing the main points of the content, including the user's background, their parents' disapproval, and the decision to keep the visit a secret or not.
Output (b)
Output (a)
Output (b)
Output (b) is better. It more precisely executes the instruction by summarizing the content while keeping the main points, and it also provides more detail and context about the user's needs and feelings. Output (a) is more general and doesn't provide as much detail or context.
