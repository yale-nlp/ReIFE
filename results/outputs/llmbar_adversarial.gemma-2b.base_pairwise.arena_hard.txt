**Answer (a)** is better.    The function in **Answer (a)** uses a while loop to find the least common multiple of two numbers. The loop continues until the remainder of the division of the two numbers is 0. This ensures that the function finds the lowest non-negative multiple of the two numbers, which is the least common multiple.    The function in **Answer (b)** uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the least common multiple of two numbers. The Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number and taking the remainder. The remainder is then divided by the previous remainder, and so on. The process continues until the remainder is 0.    The function in **Answer (a)** is more efficient than the function in **Answer (b)**. This is because the function in **Answer (a)** only needs to iterate through the numbers until the least common multiple is found, while the function in **Answer (b)** needs to iterate through the numbers until the largest number is reached.    Therefore, **Answer (a)** is better because it is more efficient and finds the least common multiple of two numbers more accurately.
