"Hey there, little one! Do you know how the water cycle works? Well, let me tell you! The sun heats up the Earth, and that makes the water in the oceans, lakes, and rivers warm up and turn into water vapor. Then, the water vapor rises up into the sky and cools down, turning back into liquid water. This water can fall back down to the Earth as rain or snow! And then, the cycle starts all over again. Isn't that cool? The water cycle is like a big circle that never ends!"  This revised output is more accurate and detailed than output (a), but it still uses simple language and relatable examples to make the water cycle accessible to a 5-year-old.
