Both outputs meet the criteria to some extent for user intention inference, accuracy, and completeness of instruction following. However, Output (a) is more effective in meeting the criteria of the given requirement by providing a more concise and accurate summary of the statistics mentioned in the article. Output (a) directly states the equivalent value and provides the exact unit of measurement, while Output (b) only mentions the equivalent number of Olympic swimming pools without providing the exact value in litres.  Therefore, Output (a) is better. It is more concise, accurate, and comprehensive in summarizing the statistics mentioned in the article, while also meeting the criteria for text quality, information richness, user intention inference, accuracy, and completeness of instruction following.
After carefully considering the analysis for each aspect, I have weighed the importance of each aspect and made a final decision.  In terms of text quality, both outputs are grammatically correct, free of spelling errors or typos, and use punctuation marks properly and consistently. The overall text in both outputs is fluent and coherent, and consistent in its style, tone, and provided information. Both outputs meet the criteria for text quality.  In terms of information richness, Output (b) is more informative and detailed, providing specific examples of the actions being taken by these companies, such as the number of sensors being deployed and the use of artificial intelligence and narrowband internet of things (NB-IoT) communications. Output (a), on the other hand, is a shorter and more straightforward summary of the statistics provided in the article.  In terms of user intention inference, both outputs provide relevant information and do not require any inference or additional clarification. The outputs directly address the statistics mentioned in the article and provide clear and concise summaries.  In terms of accuracy, both outputs accurately convey the same statistic: nearly 3 billion liters (660 million gallons) of water are lost to leaks daily in England and Wales, equivalent to 1,180 Olympic swimming pools.  In terms of completeness of instruction following, Output (a) is more complete in following the instruction to summarize the statistics mentioned in the article, while Output (b) provides additional context but is less concise and accurate in summarizing the statistics.  Based on the analysis, I conclude that Output (a) is better. It is more concise, directly provides the statistic without any additional context, and meets the criteria for text quality, information richness, user intention inference, accuracy, and completeness of instruction following. While Output (b) provides additional context and elaborates on the actions being taken by the water companies, it is less concise and accurate in summarizing the statistics. Therefore, I recommend Output (a) as the better output.
