**Explanation:**    The text describes a new Passenger Name Record (PNR) directive proposed by the EU to combat terrorism and other serious crimes. The directive mandates the collection of PNR data by airlines and the establishment of Passenger Information Units (PIUs) in each EU member state.    The concerns and opposition from the public about the new PNR directive primarily revolve around privacy and the potential for discriminatory profiling. Critics argue that the directive is overly intrusive and that it may not be effective in preventing terrorism.

The concerns are well-articulated and address the main issues related to the directive. Output (a) also includes additional information about the potential impact of the directive on privacy and the potential for discriminatory profiling.
**Explanation:**    The new PNR directive has raised concerns about privacy and the potential for discriminatory profiling. Critics argue that the five-year data retention period is too long and that the directive may not prevent discriminatory profiling of individuals. The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) has also questioned the effectiveness of PNR collection for crime prevention.    However, the text rules out any processing of data revealing a person's race or ethnic origin, religion, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life. PIUs will be obliged to delete any such data if they receive it. This is to avoid infringing EU anti-discrimination law.    Therefore, **Output (a)** is better. While there are concerns about privacy and potential discrimination, the directive aims to prevent serious crime and ensure that PNR data is used appropriately.
**Explanation:**    The new PNR directive aims to prevent terrorism and other serious crimes by establishing a joint system for police and justice officials to access airline passenger data. While the directive has the potential to improve crime prevention, there are concerns about its potential infringement on privacy rights.    **Output (a)** highlights the concerns about the directive's potential discriminatory profiling and its ineffectiveness in addressing terrorism.
