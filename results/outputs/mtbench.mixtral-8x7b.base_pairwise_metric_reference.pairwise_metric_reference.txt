Output (a) is better. It directly compares the elements of the two arrays and only increments the index of the array where the current element does not exist in the other array, thus effectively skipping over elements in the longer array. It also does not create any new arrays or objects as intermediate data structures during
Output (a)  (The reason for this answer is that Output (a) provides a more detailed and comprehensive explanation of probability, including the formula for calculating probability, the concept of independent events, and the types of probability distributions.
