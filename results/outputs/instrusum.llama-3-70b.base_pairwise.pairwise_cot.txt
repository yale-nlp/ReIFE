Output (b) also provides more context about the examples of couples who died shortly after each other, which helps to understand the views of the quoted persons.   Therefore, Output (b) is better.
The instruction asks to summarize the quoted persons and their views. Both outputs mention Dr. Sunil Shah and the British Heart Foundation, which are the main quoted persons in the article. However, Output (b) additionally mentions an FAQ on broken heart syndrome published by Johns Hopkins University, which is not a quoted person. This extra information is not required by the instruction and makes Output (b) deviate from the instruction.   Therefore, Output (a) is better.
The instruction asks for a summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. Output (a) provides a general overview of the potential benefits, mentioning the types of metals that can be extracted, but does not provide specific quantities. Output (b), on the other hand, provides specific quantities of metals that can be extracted, citing an assessment of the eastern Pacific. Therefore, Output (b) is better.
The instruction asks to summarize the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. Output (a) directly addresses this requirement by mentioning the types of metals (gold, copper, manganese, cobalt, and other metals) and providing specific quantities (27 billion tonnes of nodules, containing seven billion tonnes of manganese, 340 million tonnes of nickel, 290 million tonnes of copper, and 78 million tonnes of cobalt). Output (b) only mentions the types of metals but does not provide specific quantities, and instead focuses on the importance of these metals and the potential environmental impact. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
The instruction asks to summarize the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. Output (a) directly addresses this requirement by providing specific quantities of metals that can be extracted, such as manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt, and their estimated amounts. Output (b), on the other hand, only mentions the types of metals that can be extracted but does not provide specific quantities, and instead shifts the focus to the environmental impact of deep sea mining, which is not part of the original instruction.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.

Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Both outputs accurately summarize the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. However, Output (a) provides more context and clarity by specifying that the International Seabed Authority is working on managing the extraction of these nodules and sharing the proceeds with developing countries, which is an important aspect of the article. Output (b) only mentions that the United Nations has published its first plan for managing the extraction of these minerals, but does not provide further details. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
