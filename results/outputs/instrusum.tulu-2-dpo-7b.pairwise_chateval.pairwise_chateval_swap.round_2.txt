It highlights key milestones such as the arrival of the Puritans, the rise of alcoholism, the introduction of Prohibition, and its eventual repeal. Additionally, it provides context for the changes in alcohol consumption over time, from early Americans consuming an average of 5.8 gallons of pure alcohol a year to the present day, where Americans consume an average of 2.3 gallons of pure alcohol a year.  Output (a) provides a good summary of the article, but it does not cover the historical context as comprehensively as Output (b).

While Output (a) is a good summary, it does not provide the reader with a comprehensive understanding of the historical context of alcohol consumption in America. It is important to consider the broader historical events that led to the rise and fall of Prohibition, as they have a significant impact on the current state of alcohol consumption in the country.  An alternative solution could be to combine the strengths of both Output (a) and Output (b).

General Public:After a thorough evaluation of the two outputs, I find that "Output (b)" is better. Both outputs provide a comprehensive summary of the history of the Cononish gold mine, but Output (b) is more detailed and informative. It covers the entire history of the mine, from the initial prospectors in the mid-1980s to the current situation with Scotgold Resources and Nat le Roux. It also highlights the challenges faced by the company, such as the volatility of the gold market, the collapse of gold prices, and the impact of Covid-19 on production.  Output (a), on the other hand, is more concise but lacks the depth and detail of Output (b). It focuses mainly on the fact that Cononish is Scotland's first commercial gold mine and briefly mentions Scotgold Resources and Nat le Roux's involvement.

Output (b) accurately conveys that air pollution levels in the UK have reached high levels due to dust from storms in the Sahara and industrial pollution from Europe. This is a crucial point in understanding the current state of air pollution in the UK. 2. Output (b) correctly mentions that most air pollution in the UK comes from road transport and residential emissions, which is a significant contributor to the problem. 3. Output (b) correctly states that the EU is taking legal action against the UK for persistently exceeding safe limits for air pollution, particularly nitrogen dioxide. This information is essential to understanding the severity of the issue. 4. Output (b) accurately highlights that air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths a year worldwide, and in the UK, 30,000 people die prematurely every year from air pollution-related problems. This information is important to emphasize the severity of the issue and the potential consequences. 5. Output (b) correctly suggests that a shift towards less polluting forms of transport is needed to reduce air pollution, but it also acknowledges that this will require substantial political will and cost.

This information is crucial in understanding the context of the article and the struggles faced by the individuals.  Output (b), on the other hand, provides a brief summary of the article but does not mention the identities of the individuals or their conditions. Although it does mention that prosopagnosia is a condition that causes social embarrassment and fear of losing jobs, it does not provide enough context for the reader to understand the severity of the condition.  Therefore, Output (a) is better as it offers a more comprehensive summary of the individuals and their conditions, providing the reader with a better understanding of the context and the struggles faced by the individuals.  In conclusion, I agree with the previous referees' arguments that Output (a) is better as it offers a more comprehensive summary of the individuals and their conditions. However, I would like to suggest that in the future, both outputs could be improved by including more specific details about the individuals' experiences with prosopagnosia, such as how it affects their daily lives and relationships. This would provide the reader with a more in-depth understanding of the condition and its impact on the individuals.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.

On the other hand, Output (b) is a good summary as well, but it is more concise and does not provide as much context as Output (a). It simply states that Meena was left scarred, jobless, and in debt after being sexually harassed by her employer. While this is true, it does not provide the reader with a full understanding of the extent of Meena's struggles.  Therefore, Output (a) is better as it provides a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of sexual harassment on Meena's life. It highlights the consequences she faced, such as fear, depression, and job loss, which are essential to understanding the full extent of the impact on her life.

It highlights the consequences she faced, such as fear, depression, and job loss, which are essential to understanding the full extent of the impact on her life.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.

Here is a revised summary:  The article discusses the various theatres associated with William Shakespeare, including The Theatre, The Curtain, and The Rose. It also mentions the proposed new theatre on the site of The Theatre, and the reconstructed Globe theatre. The article describes the locations of these theatres and the history of each one.  The Theatre, built in 1576, was the first purpose-built home for drama in Britain since Roman times and may have been where Romeo and Juliet was first performed. The Curtain, built a year later, has had its foundations located during excavation work, and a major redevelopment has been approved by Hackney Council to include a permanent display of the Curtain's foundations. The Rose, opened in 1587, is thought to have hosted Titus Andronicus, one of Shakespeare's earliest plays. The original Globe theatre was founded by Shakespeare's theatre group in 1599, of which the location was identified only in the late 1980s. The reconstructed Globe theatre was opened in 1997. The Theatre, The Curtain, and The Rose were destroyed by Puritan distaste for theatre in the 1640s, the Great Fire of 1666, World War II bombing, and general indifference to the buildings' fate.

The summary also mentions the establishment of the Globe theatre by Shakespeare's theatre group, the Chamberlain's Men, in 1599. Additionally, it highlights the destruction of these theatres and the ongoing excavation and display efforts.  Output (b), on the other hand, provides more detailed information but lacks the conciseness and focus of Output (a). It includes additional details about the theatres' locations, the excavation process, and the redevelopment plans. While this information is interesting, it does not effectively summarize the main points of the article.  Therefore, Output (a) is better as it provides a clear and concise summary of the information about the old London theatres in a timeline, as required.

It also highlights the country's investment in infrastructure ahead of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, aiming to increase tourism. This output is clear and concise, adhering to the instruction by providing a precise summary of Brazil's current state in the tourism industry.  Output (b), on the other hand, states that Brazil's tourism industry remains relatively untapped, with the country not featuring in the global top 10 for overseas visitors. It also mentions factors such as distance from Europe and the US, and a perception of high crime levels as contributing to this situation. Although it provides more context, it does not precisely execute the instruction as it does not explicitly mention the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, which are significant factors in Brazil's efforts to increase tourism.

Output (b), on the other hand, is more focused on the efforts being made by the Brazilian Tourist Board to promote the country as a tourist destination. While it does provide some information about the current state of Brazil's tourism industry, it does not provide a clear and concise summary like Output (a).  Therefore, Output (a) is better.  In my evaluation, I considered the clarity and accuracy of the information presented in both outputs, as well as their ability to execute the instruction accurately. Both outputs provide a clear and concise summary of the current state of Brazil's tourism industry, but Output (a) is slightly better as it focuses more on the factors that contribute to Brazil's relatively untapped status and highlights the potential for growth in the future.  As a Critic, I have questioned the judgment of the other referees to ensure that their evaluation is well-considered and offers an alternative solution if the outputs are at the same level. In this case, I believe that Output (a) is slightly better than Output (b), but both outputs are well-written and provide a clear summary of the current state of Brazil's tourism industry.  Therefore, Output (a) is better. END OF Critic Argument

Output (a): "The article discusses a case of fraud where a woman's mother had over 14,000 pounds stolen from her through direct debit fraud. The daughter, Sue, was outraged and contacted her mother's bank, Lloyds, and the company that the direct debits were being paid to, Vodafone. Both Lloyds and Vodafone told her that there was nothing they could do and that the direct debits had been "legitimately" set up.

Therefore, Output (a) is better.|||Scientist:After a thorough evaluation, I have determined that Output (a) is better. In this case, Output (a) provides a more detailed and accurate summary of the fraud case involving a woman's mother and the refund provided by Lloyds Bank. It includes specific details about the refund, such as the amount, interest, and compensation provided by Lloyds. Additionally, it mentions that Vodafone is reviewing the case and will provide details to the police. This level of detail is crucial for understanding the situation and its consequences.  Output (b), on the other hand, is more concise but lacks the specificity of Output (a) in describing the refund and the ongoing investigation. While conciseness is important, it should not come at the cost of accuracy and completeness.  Therefore, Output (a) is better because it provides a more detailed and accurate summary of the fraud case involving a woman's mother and the refund provided by Lloyds Bank. It also includes important information about the ongoing investigation, which is relevant to the case and the potential consequences for the involved parties.  Output (a): "The article discusses a case of fraud where a woman's mother had over 14,000 pounds stolen from her through direct debit fraud. The daughter, Sue, was outraged and contacted her mother's bank, Lloyds, and the company that the direct debits were being paid to, Vodafone. Both Lloyds and Vodafone told her that there was nothing they could do and that the direct debits had been "legitimately" set up. Sue then contacted her local police force and Action Fraud, but was told that it was unlikely any further action would be taken. Lloyds eventually agreed to refund the money stolen from Margaret's account, plus interest and compensation, after being contacted by the BBC. Vodafone said that it was also looking into the case and would provide the details of an individual who may have used Margaret's account to the police."  Output (b): "Lloyds Bank has apologized and refunded over £14,000, plus interest and £600 in compensation, to a woman whose late mother's account was targeted by direct debit fraud.

It mentions that eBay bought a 19.5% stake in MercadoLibre in 2001 and pledged not to enter Latin America for at least five years, allowing MercadoLibre to dominate the region. The output also highlights the company's growth, including its 109.6 million registered users and $473m in annual revenues.  Both outputs provide a clear and concise summary of the founding story of MercadoLibre and its initial growth. However, Output (a) is slightly better as it includes more specific details about the eBay investment and the pledge not to enter Latin America for at least five years. This additional information helps to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the company's early history.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.

Both Output (a) and Output (b) are concise summaries of the founding story of MercadoLibre and its initial growth.  Output (a) is well-written, with clear sentences and good wording. It effectively conveys the key information about Marcos Galperin founding MercadoLibre in 1999, inspired by eBay while studying for an MBA at Stanford University.

It clearly explains the campaigns of these charity institutes, making it easier for the reader to understand the information provided. In contrast, Output (a) only states that the Fawcett Society and the TUC are charity institutes campaigning for gender equality in the workplace without providing specific details about their campaigns.  Therefore, Output (b) is better in terms of fluent writing, clear sentences, and good wording in summary writing.  END OF Decision END OF Decision
General Public:After carefully evaluating both Output (a) and Output (b), I have determined that Output (b) is better.  Output (b) provides a summary of the charity institutes mentioned in the article.

It highlights the centralization of power and the weakening of Tigray's influence as key factors in the conflict. The language used is precise and neutral, making it a more objective summary.

Output (b), on the other hand, provides a more detailed but less concise summary of the same events.

It condenses the key events into a clear and straightforward timeline, making it easier for readers to follow the sequence of events that led to the current conflict. In contrast, Output (b) is more detailed but less concise, which can make it harder for readers to grasp the overall context and sequence of events.  Secondly, Output (a) is more fluent and well-written. It uses simple and clear language, which makes it easier for readers to understand the information. Output (b), on the other hand, uses more complex language, which can make it harder for some readers to comprehend.  Lastly, Output (a) is more objective and unbiased. It presents the events in a neutral manner, without taking sides or expressing any personal opinions. Output (b), on the other hand, includes some subjective language, which can make it seem biased and less objective.  Therefore, I believe that Output (a) is better for summarizing Ethiopia's political evolution in a timeline. It is more concise, easier to understand, and more fluent and well-written. It also presents the events in a neutral manner, which makes it more objective and unbiased.

General Public:In evaluating the two outputs, I have considered whether they accurately and precisely execute the instruction to summarize the Victorian photographic method and the process Jack Lowe uses to capture the RNLI volunteers.  Output (a) states that Jack Lowe uses a 110-year-old camera to capture images of RNLI volunteers on glass plates through a Victorian photographic method called ambrotype. The process involves coating a glass plate with chemicals and exposing it to light through the camera. A fixative is then applied to stop the process and set the picture.

Output (b), on the other hand, focuses too narrowly on the anonymity aspect of the apps, which is only one aspect of the article's discussion. It explains that Whisper and Secret allow users to post anonymous statements, and while they have raised significant funds, their promises of anonymity are essentially a marketing gimmick due to the potential for law enforcement involvement.

Both Output (a) and Output (b) provide summaries of the founders' perspective on the purpose of the Secret app, but Output (a) is more accurate and concise in conveying their views.  Output (a) effectively captures the founders' belief that the app can help train users in empathy, while also acknowledging the potential for whistle-blowing. This summary accurately represents the main ideas from the article without going into unnecessary detail or omitting important information.  Output (b), on the other hand, seems to be a more general summary of the article, focusing on the promises and challenges of anonymity on the internet.

It accurately represents the founders' perspective on the purpose of Secret and effectively conveys the main ideas from the article. As a Critic, I am confident in my evaluation and claim that Output (a) is the better summary of the founders' views on the Secret app.  However, I would like to offer an alternative solution for the General Public referee. While Output (a) is a good summary, it might be beneficial to include a brief mention of the potential for whistle-blowing in the summary, as it is an important aspect of the app. This would make the summary more comprehensive and accurately represent the founders' views.  Therefore, I suggest the following alternative summary for the General Public referee:  "The founders of Secret believe that their app provides a platform for users to share information and feelings anonymously, without the fear of being identified. They also believe that the app can help train users in empathy, as it allows them to share experiences and emotions that they might not feel comfortable sharing on other social media platforms. While the app has the potential for whistle-blowing, the founders emphasize that it is not solely focused on this aspect. This summary effectively conveys the main ideas from the article without going into unnecessary detail or omitting important information."  This alternative summary provides a more comprehensive representation of the founders' views while still accurately capturing their perspective on the purpose of Secret.

It also mentions specific initiatives taken by both cities, such as the revamping of curriculum and the recruitment of top teachers. This output demonstrates a more thorough understanding of the factors that have led to the success of Shanghai and Hong Kong's education systems.  Output (b), on the other hand, provides a good summary of the main points but lacks the depth and specificity of Output (a). It focuses more on the devotion to education and the concentration of resources, but it does not provide as much detail on the specific actions taken by Shanghai and Hong Kong to improve their education systems.  In conclusion, Output (a) is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of the factors contributing to the factors that have led to the success of Shanghai and Hong Kong's education systems. Therefore, Output (a) is better.

This would make Output (b) a more comprehensive summary of the article.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.

It also mentions the various countries from which immigrants are arriving, such as Haiti, Senegal, Nigeria, the Dominican Republic, and Bangladesh. This summary effectively captures the essence of the article and provides readers with a clear understanding of the main reasons for the influx of immigrants in Brazil.  Output (b), on the other hand, provides a more detailed and specific explanation of the reasons for seeking shelter in Brazil, but it does not summarize the main reasons as effectively as Output (a). It focuses more on the difficulties faced by immigrants in Brasileia and the strain on resources, but it does not provide a clear overview of the main reasons for the influx of immigrants.

Clarity: Output (a) is more concise and clear in summarizing the feelings of new mothers during the pandemic. 2. Emphasis on emotions: Output (a) effectively captures the emotions and experiences shared by the new mothers, while Output (b) focuses more on the background information. 3. Overall understanding: Output (a) provides a clear understanding of the emotions and experiences shared by the new mothers, while Output (b) may not be as effective in conveying this message.

It also highlights the council's vision for Manchester as an "alternative centre of gravity" rather than a direct competitor to London. This output is relevant to the general public's interest in the story and provides a clear understanding of the council's perspective.  Output (a) is more concise but lacks the depth and engagement of Output (b). It states that the council believes the Home centre will be a catalyst for regeneration and help Manchester become a cultural powerhouse, but it does not provide the same level of detail or context as Output (b).  Therefore, Output (b) is better as it more accurately and precisely executes the given instruction, providing a more comprehensive and engaging summary of the Manchester City Council's opinion on the Home centre.

It clearly states that he believes tobacco companies have the right to meet MEPs, that they are open and honest in their lobbying efforts, and that the scale of the tobacco lobby is often exaggerated. The summary also highlights his argument that there are at least as many lobbyists arguing against their positions as there are for them.  Output (b), on the other hand, does not provide a clear summary of Ronan Barry's opinions. It mentions that he believes tobacco companies have as much right to meet MEPs as any other business, but it does not provide any context or explanation for his statement. It also does not mention his views on the scale of the tobacco lobby or the number of lobbyists arguing against their positions.

It also mentions that he does not recognize the tactics described by the MEP. This output is honest and provides a clear perspective from Ronan Barry on the topic.  Output (b) states that Ronan Barry believes that his company is always open and honest in their lobbying efforts and that tobacco companies have as much right to meet MEPs as any other business. It also mentions that the scale of the tobacco lobby is often exaggerated and that there are at least as many lobbyists arguing against their positions as there are for them. This output is also honest and provides a clear perspective from Ronan Barry on the topic.  Both Output (a) and Output (b) are equally fluent, clear, and well-written in conveying Ronan Barry's opinions on the matter. Therefore, neither Output (a) nor Output (b) is better in terms of fluent writing, clear sentences, and good wording.  However, I would like to offer an alternative solution. Instead of using both outputs together, I would suggest combining the most important points from both Output (a) and Output (b) to create a more comprehensive summary. This would ensure that the most relevant and important information is presented in a clear and concise manner.  Therefore, neither Output (a) nor Output (b) is better. Instead, I would recommend using both outputs together to provide a more comprehensive understanding of Ronan Barry's views.

Output (a) provides a concise summary of Tavener's popular choral works, mentioning "The Protecting Veil," "Song For Athene," and "A New Beginning." It also briefly mentions the key moments these works were played, such as topping the classical charts, being played at Princess Diana's funeral, and marking the end of the 20th century. However, it does not provide specific years for these events, which could be confusing for readers.  Output (b), on the other hand, provides a more detailed summary of Tavener's popular choral works, mentioning "The Protecting Veil," "Song For Athene," and "A New Beginning." It also mentions the key moments these works were played, such as topping the classical charts in 1992, being played at Princess Diana's funeral in 1997, and being chosen to mark the end of the 20th century at the Millennium Dome in London in 1999. However, it does not provide a concise summary of Tavener's choral works, which could make it less appealing to readers.  Based on this evaluation, I find that Output (a) is better because it provides a concise summary of Tavener's popular choral works while also mentioning the key moments they were played.

In my evaluation, I found that Output (a) is better because it provides a concise summary of Tavener's popular choral works while also mentioning the key moments they were played. However, it could be improved by providing specific years for the events mentioned. Output (b) provides a more detailed summary, but it lacks a concise summary of Tavener's choral works, which makes it less appealing to readers.  As a Critic, I would suggest that Output (a) is better, but I would also like to propose an alternative solution. Instead of providing specific years for the events mentioned, Output (a) could be improved by adding a brief sentence or two about the impact of Tavener's choral works on the music industry or the audience. This would make the summary more comprehensive and informative for readers.  Therefore, Output (a) with the proposed improvement is better.

END OF General Public Argument  Scientist: In evaluating the two outputs, I will prioritize assessing their honesty, precision, and level of detail in addressing the measures taken by retailer companies in response to Brexit.  Output (a) provides a clear and concise summary of the situation, mentioning that some EU online retailers have stopped delivering to the UK due to increased costs and bureaucracy resulting from the new VAT rules. It also highlights specific examples of retailers such as Dutch Bike Bits and Beer On Web, who have stopped dealing with British customers. Furthermore, it accurately describes the additional charges imposed by international shipping companies including Federal Express and TNT to reflect the increased investment they have had to make in adjusting their systems to cope with Brexit.  Output (b), on the other hand, is a more detailed summary of the situation, but it lacks the precision and honesty of (a). It mentions that some EU specialist online retailers have stopped delivering to the UK, but it does not provide specific examples like (a).

It mentions that Ford HQ in 2008 decided to operate as a global company, but it does not explicitly state the consequences of this decision for Ford's operations.  Therefore, Output (a) is better. END OF Critic Argument  As a Critic, I would like to question the judgment of the previous referees. While both outputs provide a clear summary of the "One Ford Plan" and its implications for Ford's operations, Output (a) is better as it provides a more concise and accurate summary of the "One Ford Plan" and its consequences.  If I were to offer an alternative solution, I would suggest that Output (a) is better, but Output (b) could be improved by adding a sentence or two explicitly state the consequences of the "One Ford decided that Output (a) is better.

General Public:After a thorough evaluation of the two outputs, I find that "Output (b)" is better. Both outputs provide definitions of collusion, but Output (b) offers a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of the term. It includes definitions from multiple sources, such as Sir John Stevens, Canadian judge Peter Cory, the first police ombudsman for Northern Ireland Nuala O'Loan, and Irish judge Peter Smithwick. This broad range of perspectives allows for a more nuanced understanding of collusion and its various interpretations.  Output (a) provides a summary of the definitions given by these individuals, but it does not offer a clear and concise explanation of collusion. It simply lists the definitions without providing any analysis or context. In contrast, Output (b) provides a clear explanation of each definition, highlighting the key elements and synonyms. This makes it easier for the reader to understand the concept of collusion and its various interpretations.  Therefore, Output (b) is better as it offers a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of collusion, providing a clear understanding of the concept and its various interpretations.|||Scientist:After a thorough evaluation, I find that "Output (b)" is better.

As a Scientist, I believe in the importance of providing accurate and comprehensive information to the public. Output (a) does just that by presenting a clear and concise summary of the various definitions of collusion. This helps the reader to better understand the topic and form their own opinions based on a well-rounded understanding of the subject.  Therefore, Output (a) is better as it provides a more comprehensive summary of the different definitions of collusion and the perspectives of the people who provided them.  END OF Scientist Argument  # Debate: The General Public and the Scientist had different opinions on which output was better. The General Public argued that Output (a) was better because it provided a more comprehensive summary of the different definitions of collusion. The Scientist, on the other hand, argued that Output (a) was better because it provided a clear and concise summary of the various definitions of collusion and the perspectives of the people who provided them.  The General Public's argument is based on the need for a comprehensive summary that covers all the different interpretations of collusion. They believe that Output (a) provides this comprehensive summary, making it a better choice for the reader.  The Scientist's argument, however, focuses on the importance of providing accurate and comprehensive information to the public. They believe that Output (a) does just that by presenting a clear and concise summary of the various definitions of collusion and the perspectives of the people who provided them.  In the end, both arguments have their merits. The General Public's argument highlights the importance of comprehensiveness, while the Scientist's argument emphasizes the importance of accuracy and comprehensiveness.  Therefore, after careful consideration and debate, I conclude that Output (a) is better as it provides a more comprehensive summary of the different definitions of collusion and the perspectives of the people who provided them.
