**Answer (a) is better.**    The article provides a detailed comparison of the anonymity offered by different apps. While both Whisper and Secret claim to provide anonymity, the key difference lies in how they achieve this. Whisper focuses on pseudonymous communication, allowing users to post anonymous statements that are not tied to their real identities. Secret, on the other hand, accesses users' phone contacts and shows them only secrets from friends or friends of friends. This allows users to share more personal and sensitive information while still maintaining some level of anonymity.    Additionally, Whisper's approach is more transparent. Users are explicitly informed that their posts are not private and that they may be visible to other users. Secret, on the other hand, is more deceptive. While the app claims to provide anonymity, there is still the potential for users to be identified and for legal issues to arise.    Therefore, Answer (a) is better as it provides a more transparent and comprehensive understanding of the issue.

**Answer (a) is better.**    The founders of Secret argue that their app is not just about whistle-blowing, but also about empathy. They believe that Facebook has trained users to curate their identity, and that Secret can help train us in empathy. They also note that while they think about profits, they have not yet invested resources in solving this problem.    The article highlights the fact that some critics argue that the app is a marketing gimmick and that promises of anonymity are essentially meaningless. However, the founders argue that the app is not about sharing feelings that can't be expressed publicly, but about providing a space for people to express themselves without fear of reprisal. They also argue that the app can train people in empathy, allowing them to share feelings that can't be expressed publicly.    Therefore, Answer (a) is better because it provides a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of the topic.

It acknowledges the founders' perspective that the app is not just about whistle-blowing, but also about empathy. However, it also argues that the app's focus on empathy could potentially lead to a loss of privacy and that the promises of anonymity are not as meaningful as some users may believe. Additionally, it points out that the app's design and functionality could make it easier for law enforcement to identify users, even if they choose to remain anonymous.
**Answer (a) is better.**    The founders of Secret argue that their app is not just about whistle-blowing, but also about empathy. They believe that Facebook has trained users to curate their identity, and that Secret can help train us in empathy. However, some critics argue that the app is simply a marketing gimmick and that promises of anonymity are essentially meaningless.    Secret's founders' argument that their app is not just about whistle-blowing, but also about empathy is more convincing. The app allows users to share experiences and emotions that they might not feel comfortable sharing on other social media platforms. This allows users to connect with each other on a deeper level and to build trust. Additionally, Secret's focus on empathy is more likely to resonate with users than Facebook's focus on curation.    Therefore, Answer (a) is better.

**Answer (a) is better.**    The solution to London's housing crisis that involves building more homes on green belt land is a more sustainable and long-term solution. It would provide much-needed housing for Londoners while preserving the city's green spaces and biodiversity.    The argument that building on brownfield sites is a more controversial solution is not as strong as the argument for building on green belt land. While brownfield sites can be contaminated and expensive to clean, they are often underutilized and can be developed into new housing units. Additionally, the government can use tax incentives and other policies to make building on brownfield sites more attractive to developers.
**Answer (a) is better.**    The argument presented in answer (a) is more convincing and provides a more comprehensive analysis of the issue. It acknowledges the concerns raised about the green belt and the potential impact on recreation and the character of London. While answer (b) acknowledges the need for housing solutions, it focuses more on the economic benefits of building new homes rather than the potential environmental and social impacts. Additionally, answer (a) provides a more detailed justification for why building on green belt land is a viable solution.    Therefore, based on the evaluation, Answer (a) is better.
**Evaluation (a):**    The answer effectively highlights the potential benefits of building more homes on green belt land, such as increasing housing supply and providing more affordable housing options. However, it also acknowledges the concerns raised about the potential impact on green spaces and the importance of preserving these areas for recreation and biodiversity.    **Evaluation (b):**    While the answer is concise and touches on the main points, it lacks the depth and analysis of answer (a). It does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the different solutions or consider any potential drawbacks or trade-offs associated with each option.    **Therefore, Answer (a) is better.**
**Answer (a) is better.**    The argument in favor of building more homes on green belt land is more compelling. While it is true that green belt land is important for recreation purposes and to maintain a separation between settlements, these concerns can be mitigated by building homes in a way that preserves the green space. For example, developers could build homes on the edges of the green belt or use sustainable construction methods that minimize the impact on the environment.    Therefore, the argument that building more homes on green belt land is a viable solution to London's housing crisis is more convincing.
**Answer (a) is better.**    The solution of building more properties on green belt lands is more sustainable and would result in more affordable housing for a larger population. Additionally, it would preserve green space and protect the natural environment.
