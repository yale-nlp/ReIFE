Completeness of Instruction Following: Output (a) closely follows the instruction by providing a single word that does not belong with the others without adding any additional information. Output (b) provides more information than the instruction asked for.  Output (b) initially appears to be more informative, but it misinterprets the instruction by categorizing the words rather than identifying which one does not belong based on the given list. The instruction does not provide a context for categorization, and thus, Output (b)'s explanation is not relevant. Output (a) is not accurate in its selection of the word that does not belong, as "engine" is as much a part of a car as the steering wheel. However, since the instruction does not specify the criteria for determining which word does not belong, Output (a) is closer to following the instruction as given, despite lacking accuracy in the context of car components.  Therefore, Output (b) is better because it provides a more accurate answer based on the categorization of the words, even though it goes beyond the instruction by offering an explanation.
