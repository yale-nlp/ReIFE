Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Output (a) is more comprehensive in summarizing Professor Suzuki's opinions, as it mentions the key points that the radiation levels released from Fukushima were much lower than Chernobyl, the large-scale survey conducted in Japan has never been done before, and that Prof. Suzuki and other experts think there will be very few or even zero extra childhood cancers due to Fukushima.

Output (b), on the other hand, does not provide specific quantities of metals and instead mentions the environmental impact, which is not requested in the instruction.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Output (a) and Output (b) both provide a summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining. However, Output (b) includes the additional information that "companies could apply for licences from as soon as 2016", which is not directly related to the potential benefits of deep sea mining. Output (a) sticks more closely to the requirement, focusing on the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted and the management of the extraction process.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.
