The summary in Output (b) more accurately captures the key statistics from the article by including the percentage increase in mental health leave across the UK (nearly a third), the doubling of the figure in London, and the specific numbers of staff taking leave in Scotland and Northern Ireland. It also provides additional relevant context by mentioning the survey results from Mind's Blue Light programme, which highlights the prevalence of mental health issues among emergency service workers. Overall, Output (b) provides a more comprehensive and informative summary compared to Output (a).
Therefore, Output (a) is better.  Output (a) more precisely executes the instruction by focusing on the key statistics related to fire staff's mental health issues, as requested.

Both outputs provide a similar summary of Dr. Sunil Shah's views on the connection between bereavement and heart health, as well as the description of broken heart syndrome by the British Heart Foundation. However, Output (b) adds the additional information from Johns Hopkins University about the difference between heart attacks and cardiomyopathy, which provides more context and a clearer distinction. Therefore, Output (b) is better.
Therefore, Output (b) is better.  Output (b) provides a more detailed and accurate summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, as per the given requirement. It mentions the specific types and quantities of metals that can be extracted, while also briefly touching on the timeline for licensing and the involvement of the United Nations. Output (a) is more focused on the environmental concerns and lacks the specific details about the metals and their quantities.
Therefore, Output (a) is better.  Output (a) directly addresses the potential benefits of deep sea mining as requested in the summary requirement, providing specific details on the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It also mentions the economic aspect of providing incentives for developing countries, which is relevant to the management plan. On the other hand, Output (b) focuses more on the environmental concerns and the uncertainty of the impact, which is not the main focus of the summary requirement.
Therefore, Output (a) is better.  Output (a) more precisely and accurately summarizes the potential benefits of deep sea mining as per the given requirement, focusing on the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It also mentions the involvement of the United Nations' International Seabed Authority in managing the extraction and sharing the proceeds, which is relevant to the benefits for humanity. Output (b) includes additional information about the environmental concerns, which is not within the scope of the given summary requirement.
Therefore, Output (a) is better.  Output (a) directly addresses the potential benefits of deep sea mining by summarizing the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted, as specified in the summary requirement. It provides specific numbers and a clear focus on the economic aspect of the mining operation.  Output (b) includes a mention of the metals but also introduces the environmental concerns, which is not in line with the given summary requirement that asks for a focus on the potential benefits. While the environmental aspect is important, it deviates from the specified task.
Therefore, Output (b) is better.  Output (b) provides a more comprehensive summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, clearly stating the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted, as well as mentioning the United Nations' plan and the possibility of companies applying for licenses from 2016. Output (a) omits the mention of the year when companies could apply for licenses and is slightly less detailed in describing the metal quantities.
