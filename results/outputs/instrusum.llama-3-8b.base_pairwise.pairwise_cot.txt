It includes specific examples and quotes, which are not necessary to summarize the article. Output (a), on the other hand, provides a concise and precise summary of the article, focusing on the main points and scientific evidence.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.
The instruction is to summarize the quoted persons and their views. Both Output (a) and Output (b) provide a summary of Dr. Sunil Shah's view on bereavement's effect on heart health and the British Heart Foundation's definition of "broken heart syndrome." However, Output (b) provides additional information from an FAQ published by Johns Hopkins University, which provides a clearer distinction between heart attacks and cardiomyopathy.  Therefore, Output (b) is better.
The instruction is to summarize the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. Output (b) provides a more precise and detailed summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, mentioning the specific types and quantities of metals that can be extracted, as well as the UN's plan for managing the extraction of these minerals. Output (a) provides a more general summary, mentioning the types of metals that can be extracted but not providing specific quantities or details about the UN's plan.  Therefore, Output (b) is better.
The instruction is to summarize the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. Both Output (a) and Output (b) attempt to summarize the benefits of deep sea mining, but Output (a) provides more specific and detailed information about the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted.  Output (a) accurately states that the eastern Pacific alone could contain more than 27 billion tonnes of nodules, containing seven billion tonnes of manganese, 340 million tonnes of nickel, 290 million tonnes of copper, and 78 million tonnes of cobalt. This information is not present in Output (b), which only mentions the general types of metals that can be extracted.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.
The instruction requires a summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. Both Output (a) and Output (b) attempt to summarize the benefits of deep sea mining, but Output (a) provides a more precise and detailed summary of the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted.  Output (a) accurately states that the potential benefits of deep sea mining include the extraction of gold, copper, manganese, cobalt, and other metals, and provides specific quantities of these metals that can be extracted. Output (b) only mentions manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt, and does not provide specific quantities.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.
The instruction requires a summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. Both Output (a) and Output (b) attempt to summarize the benefits of deep sea mining, but Output (a) provides a more precise and detailed summary of the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted.  Output (a) specifically mentions the types of metals that can be extracted, including gold, copper, manganese, cobalt, and other metals, and provides exact quantities of these metals that can be found in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Output (b) only mentions a few types of metals, such as manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt, and does not provide specific quantities.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.
The instruction is to summarize the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. Both Output (a) and Output (b) provide a summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. However, Output (a) provides a more concise and focused summary, directly stating the potential benefits and quantities of metals that can be extracted. Output (b) provides a slightly more detailed summary, but also includes some additional information that is not directly relevant to the instruction.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.
