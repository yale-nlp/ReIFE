The conflict between the Ethiopian government and forces in the Tigray region is a complex issue with multiple factors contributing to its escalation. Based on the provided article, the main factors that led to the conflict can be summarized as follows:  1. **Power Struggle**: The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was once a dominant political party, was sidelined by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed when he took office in 2018. This power struggle was a significant factor in the conflict.  2. **Political Reforms**: Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed pursued reforms, which included the removal of key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression. Tigray's resistance to these reforms contributed to the crisis.  3. **Election Dispute**: The central government deemed Tigray's decision to hold its own regional election in September illegal, which further escalated tensions.  4. **Economic and Political Sanctions**: The central government suspended funding for and cut ties with Tigray, which Tigray's administration viewed as a declaration of war.  5. **Military Confrontation**: The conflict began on November 4th when Abiy ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray, following an alleged attack on a military base by Tigrayan forces.  Now, let's evaluate the assistants' answers:  **Answer (a)** provides a comprehensive summary that includes all the main factors mentioned above. It clearly outlines the power struggle, the role of political reforms, the election dispute, the economic and political sanctions, and the military confrontation.

The article discusses the various opinions and ideas of different political parties in the UK regarding apprenticeships. To summarize the article based on the given requirement, the following points should be included:  1. The Conservatives aim to create 16,000 new apprenticeships and an additional three million training places. 2. Labour pledges to create 80,000 more apprenticeships, with a focus on the High Speed 2 rail line project. 3. The Liberal Democrats want to expand apprenticeships and establish national colleges for vocational skills. 4. UKIP proposes allowing students to take an apprenticeship instead of four non-core GCSE subjects. 5. The Green Party plans to increase funding for apprenticeships. 6. The SNP aims to provide 125,000 modern apprenticeships and promote vocational training. 7. Plaid Cymru supports the European Union's Youth Jobs Guarantee and higher level apprenticeships.  Now, let's evaluate the assistants' answers:  <|The Start of Answer (a)|> The article discusses the opinions and ideas of different people regarding apprenticeships. The Conservatives want to create 16,000 new apprenticeships, with a promise to create an extra three million 'training places' if the party remains in power after the general election in May. They want to pay for it with money saved from benefits caps. Baroness Brady, a Tory peer and star of The Apprentice (fittingly enough), said the party wants apprenticeships to be held on par with degrees. Labour has pledged to create 80,000 more apprenticeships. However, 33,000 of those would come from just one project, the High Speed 2 rail line (HS2). That raises questions about what will happen once that project is complete, or if it suffers any delays. Ed Miliband has promised apprenticeships to every school leaver who "gets the grades" - that's level 3 qualifications, which are equivalent to having two A-levels. Those with two A-Levels will also qualify, but the scheme will exclude those who only have GCSEs. The party has also announced plans to boost job prospects for young people by giving teenagers face-to-face advice in schools. That will include steering people towards more apprenticeships, rather than directing them towards university or unskilled jobs. The scheme has been budgeted at £50m. Nick Clegg has pledged to expand apprenticeships and develop national colleges for vocational skills. He wants to end the "barely concealed snobbery" about apprenticeships, which he claims comes from adults, rather than young people. The Lib Dems have gone to great lengths to point out the two million apprenticeships available under the coalition, stating that he and Vince Cable have been instrumental in pushing for them. The party told Newsbeat it wants to double that number in the next parliament. UKIP has pledged to introduce an option for students to take an apprenticeship (with a qualification at the end) instead of four non-core GCSE subjects. The employers they work with will be qualified to test and grade the apprentices, and the students can carry on working with them through their A-levels. The party has also promised to scrap the target of 50% of school leavers going on to university, while scrapping tuition fees for some students taking degrees in high-demand vocational subjects like maths, technology, engineering, medicine and science - so long as they live, work and pay taxes in the UK for five years after they graduate. The Green Party hasn't published a specific policy on apprenticeships, but told News <|The End of Answer (a)|>  <|The Start of Answer (b)|> The main political parties in the UK are all pushing for more apprenticeships to help young people find work and gain qualifications. The Conservatives have proposed creating 16,000 new apprenticeships and Labour has promised better careers advice for teens. The Tories also want apprenticeships to be held on par with degrees, while Labour has pledged to create 80,000 more apprenticeships, with 33,000 of those coming from the High Speed 2 rail line. The Liberal Democrats want to expand apprenticeships and develop national colleges for vocational skills, while UKIP has proposed an option for students to take an apprenticeship instead of four non-core GCSE subjects. The Green Party has promised to expand apprenticeships by increasing funding, while the SNP has pledged to provide 125,000 modern apprenticeships and Plaid Cymru wants to promote higher level apprenticeships and in-work learning. <|The End of Answer(b)|>  Evaluation: Answer (a) provides a comprehensive summary of the article, including details about the Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, UKIP, Green Party, SNP, and Plaid Cymru's policies on apprenticeships. It mentions the specific numbers of apprenticeships proposed, the conditions for eligibility, and the funding sources. The answer is helpful, relevant, and concise, and it includes all the necessary information to meet the user's requirement.  Answer (b) is also helpful and relevant, but it is less concise than Answer

To summarize the article based on the given requirement, the following is an appropriate summary:  Sir John (now Lord) Stevens, the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, provided a definition of collusion that ranges from the wilful failure to keep records to the extreme of agents being involved in murder. Canadian judge Peter Cory defined collusion as involving secret understandings, deliberate ignoring, and turning a blind eye. The first police ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala (now Baroness) O'Loan, adopted the definitions of Stevens and Cory. Al Hutchinson, her successor, applied a less broad definition. Sir Christopher de Silva gave a working definition of collusion that was less broad than Cory's and more in line with the Billy Wright inquiry panel. Irish judge Peter Smithwick also provided a similar definition to Cory's.  Now, let's evaluate the assistants' answers:  Answer (a) is well-structured and provides a clear summary of the definitions given by the individuals mentioned in the article. It includes the key points from Stevens, Cory, O'Loan, Hutchinson, de Silva, and Smithwick. The answer is concise and directly addresses the user prompt.  Answer (b) is also comprehensive and includes the same key points as Answer (a). However, it is slightly more verbose and includes additional phrases that are not necessary for the summary, such as "the then Metropolitan Police Commissioner" and "the successor of O'Loan." Despite this, the information is still accurate and relevant.  In terms of helpfulness, both answers correctly respond to the prompt and provide a summary of the definitions given in the article. Both are relevant and concise. However, Answer (a) is slightly more concise and to the point.  Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
To begin, I will provide my own summary of the article based on the given requirement:  In the article, several individuals have contributed their definitions of the term "collusion." Sir John (now Lord) Stevens, then Metropolitan Police Commissioner, described collusion as encompassing actions from the wilful failure to keep records to the involvement of agents in murder. Canadian judge Peter Cory expanded on this by including dictionary definitions and synonyms like "connive," emphasizing deliberate ignoring or overlooking. Nuala (now Baroness) O'Loan, the first police ombudsman for Northern Ireland, adopted Stevens' and Cory's definitions. Al Hutchinson, her successor, applied a narrower definition. Sir Christopher de Silva and Irish judge Peter Smithwick also provided their definitions, with Smithwick emphasizing that collusion can involve omissions or failures to act.  Now, let's evaluate the two provided answers:  Answer (a) is concise and covers all the key individuals who provided definitions of collusion. It lists the individuals and their definitions without unnecessary details. The answer is clear and directly addresses the user prompt.  Answer (b) is also comprehensive and includes all the individuals mentioned in the article. However, it is slightly more verbose than Answer (a), with additional details that are not strictly necessary for the summary. The answer is still helpful and relevant, but it could be considered less concise.  Considering the criteria of helpfulness, relevance, conciseness, and the inclusion of all necessary information, both answers are adequate. However, Answer (a) is more concise and to the point, which makes it more effective for the given summary requirement.  Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
To summarize the article based on the given requirement, the following is an appropriate summary:  The article presents various definitions of collusion, with several key similarities. Most definitions emphasize that collusion involves an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose. They also highlight the importance of deliberate actions or omissions, such as the ignoring or turning a blind eye to known wrongdoing, the withholding of intelligence and evidence, and the failure to keep records or take action against known wrongdoings.  Now, let's evaluate the assistants' answers:  Answer (a) provides a clear and concise summary of the similarities in the definitions of collusion. It mentions the agreement or arrangement, the deliberate ignoring or turning a blind eye to wrongdoing, and the withholding of intelligence and evidence. This answer is helpful, relevant, and concise.  Answer (b) also provides a summary that includes the agreement or arrangement aspect of collusion and the consideration of both positive actions and deliberate omissions. However, it is slightly less concise than Answer (a) and omits the specific mention of the withholding of intelligence and evidence, which is a significant point from the article.  Considering the clarity, conciseness, and completeness of the information provided, Answer (a) is more thorough and precise in its summary.  Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
The article discusses various definitions of collusion provided by different individuals, including Sir John Stevens, Canadian judge Peter Cory, the first police ombudsman for Northern Ireland Nuala O'Loan, and others. The definitions provided by these individuals share several similarities, despite some differences in emphasis.  A summary of the similarities of the definitions of collusion provided by different people in the article would include the following points:  1. **Agreement or Arrangement**: Collusion is generally understood to involve an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose. 2. **Deliberate Act or Omission**: There is a consensus that collusion requires a deliberate act or omission, rather than mere negligence or incompetence. 3. **Ignoring or Turning a Blind Eye**: Many definitions include the deliberate ignoring or turning a blind eye to wrongful acts or omissions. 4. **Withholding of Intelligence and Evidence**: The withholding of intelligence and evidence is often cited as a component of collusion. 5. **Failure to Keep Records or Take Action**: The failure to keep records or to take action against known wrongdoing is also highlighted as part of the definition.  Now, let's evaluate the assistants' answers:  **Answer (a)**: - The answer correctly identifies the key elements of the definitions of collusion provided in the article. - It mentions the agreement or arrangement, the deliberate act or omission, and the deliberate ignoring or turning a blind eye. - It also includes the withholding of intelligence and evidence and the failure to keep records or take action against known wrongdoing.  **Answer (b)**: - This answer also captures the main elements of the definitions of collusion. - It mentions the agreement or arrangement, the deliberate ignoring or turning a blind eye, and the withholding of intelligence and evidence. - It also includes the failure to keep records or to take action against a known wrongdoing.  Both answers are helpful, relevant, and concise. They correctly summarize the key points from the article. However, Answer (a) is slightly more comprehensive in its coverage of the elements of the definitions of collusion, including the failure to keep records or take action against known wrongdoing, which is also mentioned in the article.  Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
The article discusses various definitions of collusion provided by different individuals, including Lord Stevens, Peter Cory, and others. The key elements of these definitions revolve around secret agreements or arrangements, deliberate ignoring or turning a blind eye to wrongful acts, and the consideration of both active acts and omissions as forms of collusion.  Answer (a) is more concise and directly addresses the requirement by summarizing the similarities in the definitions provided by different people. It mentions the presence of secret agreements, the act of ignoring or turning a blind eye, and the consideration of both active acts and omissions. This answer is clear and to the point, making it easy for the reader to understand the main points without unnecessary details.  Answer (b) is also relevant and touches on the same elements as Answer (a), but it is slightly more verbose and includes additional information that is not directly required by the prompt. While it mentions the withholding of intelligence and evidence, and the failure to keep records, these points are not explicitly mentioned in the user prompt and thus are not necessary for the summary.  Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
