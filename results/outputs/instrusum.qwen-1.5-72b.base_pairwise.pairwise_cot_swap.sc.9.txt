Output (a) includes additional information from a survey, which is not part of the summary requirement. Therefore, Output (b) is better.
Output (b) more closely follows the instruction by summarizing the key statistics related to mental health issues among UK fire and rescue staff without delving into additional details such as the survey results from Mind's Blue Light programme. Output (a) includes extra information about the mental health survey, which is not directly asked for in the summary requirement. Therefore, Output (b) is better.
Output (b) is better because it not only includes the key statistics requested in the summary requirement but also adds more context by mentioning the survey results from over 1,600 staff and volunteers, which highlight the severity of the mental health issues faced by emergency service workers. This additional information is relevant and provides a broader perspective on the issue. Output (a) is more concise but lacks this crucial context. Therefore, Output (b) is better.
Output (b) provides a more comprehensive summary by including the statistic that nearly nine in 10 emergency service staff have experienced stress, low mood, or poor mental health, and that one in four have contemplated suicide, which highlights the severity of the issue. Output (a) omits this crucial information. Therefore, Output (b) is better.

Output (a) omits these details and focuses more on the statistical aspect of the study. Therefore, Output (b) is better.
Both Output (a) and Output (b) summarize the views of Dr. Sunil Shah and the information provided by the British Heart Foundation accurately. However, Output (b) includes additional information from an FAQ on broken heart syndrome published by Johns Hopkins University, which clarifies the difference between a heart attack and broken heart syndrome. This added detail provides a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. Therefore, Output (b) is better.
Output (b) more closely executes the instruction by focusing on the potential benefits of deep sea mining and the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted, as required by the summary requirement. Output (a) discusses the environmental concerns, which is not the primary focus of the instruction. Therefore, Output (b) is better.

It also acknowledges the environmental concerns. In contrast, Output (a) focuses more on the UN's plan and the licensing process, which is not the main focus of the summary requirement. Therefore, Output (b) is better.
Output (a) provides a more precise and detailed summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including specific types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It also mentions the United Nations' involvement and the management of the process. In contrast, Output (b) omits details about specific metals and their quantities and focuses more on the environmental concerns, which is not the primary focus of the summary requirement. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Output (a) provides a more precise and detailed summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, mentioning specific types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It directly addresses the article's content by referencing the assessment of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Output (b), while mentioning some benefits, does not provide as much detail on the types and quantities of metals and focuses more on the environmental concerns. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Both outputs provide a summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. However, Output (a) adds more context by mentioning the specific area (Clarion-Clipperton Zone) and the UN's role in managing the process, as well as the profit-sharing aspect with developing countries. This additional information is relevant to the summary requirement and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
