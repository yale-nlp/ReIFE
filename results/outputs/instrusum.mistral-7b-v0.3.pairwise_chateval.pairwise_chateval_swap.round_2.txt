Output (a) provides a more detailed and accurate summary, as it mentions the shift towards more upmarket experiences, the focus on quality over quantity, the laws against "tourism of excesses," the ban on pub crawls and happy hours, the closure of nightclubs in certain areas, the need for better care of tourists using technology, and the criticism from locals about the over-dependence on tourism.

Output (b) only mentions the return of tourists and the criticism from locals, but it does not provide specific details about the possible future of the tourism industry. Therefore, Output (a) is better.  However, it's important to note that while Output (a) is more detailed and accurate, it may not be as concise as Output (b). If the requirement was to provide a very brief summary, Output (b) might be more suitable. In such a case, both outputs could be considered equally good, as the requirement would not prioritize detail and accuracy over brevity.
