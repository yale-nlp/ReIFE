Differences Identification: 1. Output (a) mentions the Women's Equality Party, while Output (b) only mentions the Fawcett Society. 2. Output (a) specifically calls for state childcare help to start as soon as paid parental leave is over, while Output (b) does not mention this specific aspect. 3. Output (a) does not mention the Parenting in the Workplace Institute, while Output (b) does mention it.  Explanation and Rationale: Output (a) provides more specific information about the Women's Equality Party and their call for state childcare help. This is a crucial aspect in addressing the issue of women dropping out of the workplace due to the high cost of childcare. The Women's Equality Party's proposal is a direct solution to the problem, whereas the Fawcett Society's call for flexible working and paying the living wage is a broader approach.  Output (b) also provides valuable information about the Fawcett Society's call for flexible working and paying the living wage. However, it does not provide specific information about the state childcare help proposed by the Women's Equality Party.  Both outputs mention the Fawcett Society's call for flexible working and paying the living wage, but Output (a) provides more specific information about the Women's Equality Party's proposal.
