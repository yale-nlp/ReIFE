Labour has pledged to create 80,000 more apprenticeships and provide better careers advice for teens. The Liberal Democrats want to expand apprenticeships and develop national colleges for vocational skills. UKIP has pledged to introduce an option for students to take an apprenticeship instead of four non-core GCSE subjects. The Green Party would expand apprenticeships by increasing funding and provide an apprenticeship to all qualified young people aged 16-25 who do not have one and want one. The SNP has pledged to provide 125,000 "modern" apprenticeships in the next parliament and wants as many of the new jobs as possible to be in emerging high-tech industries. Plaid Cymru wants to promote higher level apprenticeships and in-work learning for young people and adults.

Answer (b) also provides a more complete explanation of the Fermi paradox and the Rare Earth hypothesis. Therefore, Answer (b) is better.
My answer would be: The article discusses various theories and hypotheses about the existence of aliens and why we have not yet found them. The Drake Equation, created by Dr. Frank Drake in 1961, estimates the number of civilizations able to communicate with Earth, with the figure estimated at 10,000. The Fermi Paradox, posed by physicist Enrico Fermi in 1950, questions the lack of evidence for intelligent life despite high estimates. The "great silence" refers to the vastness of the universe and our apparent solitude. Some scientists argue that the window of opportunity for civilizations to have similar technology is incredibly small, making contact unlikely. Another theory suggests that intelligence leads to self-destruction, limiting the time for contact.

My answer to the prompt would be: The UK's air pollution is considered severe by UK standards, with parts of north-west Norfolk reaching the highest level on the Department of the Environment's one-to-ten scale. Pollution levels were high in East Anglia, rural parts of south-east England, and moderate in London, the Midlands, and Yorkshire and Humberside. The pollution is primarily caused by road transport and residential emissions, with a significant contribution from diesel vehicles. The EU is taking legal action against the UK for exceeding safe limits for air pollution, particularly nitrogen dioxide. It is estimated that around 30,000 people in the UK die prematurely each year due to air pollution-related health issues.  Answer (a) is better because it provides a concise and accurate summary of the severity of the UK's air pollution, including specific details about pollution levels, the substances that contribute to pollution, and the health impacts. Answer (b) incorrectly attributes the 7 million premature deaths per year to the UK alone, which is inaccurate as this figure represents global deaths due to air pollution. Additionally, answer (b) incorrectly states that the UK is taking legal action against itself, which is not the case. Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
Answer (b) provides a more accurate and detailed summary of the severity of the UK's air pollution. It correctly states that parts of north-west Norfolk hit level 10 on the Department of the Environment's one-to-10 scale, and that the pollution is caused by dust from storms in the Sahara, industrial pollution from Europe, road transport, and residential emissions. It also correctly mentions that the UK is persistently over the safe limit for air pollution, particularly levels of nitrogen dioxide, and that air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths a year around the world, with around 30,000 people in the UK dying prematurely every year from problems associated with air pollution.

It correctly states that parts of north-west Norfolk hit level 10 on the Department of the Environment's one-to-10 scale, and that the pollution is caused by a combination of dust from Sahara storms, industrial pollution from Europe, road transport, and residential emissions. It also correctly mentions that the UK is persistently over the safe limit for air pollution, particularly nitrogen dioxide levels, and faces legal action from the EU. Answer (b) also correctly states that approximately 30,000 people in the UK die prematurely every year due to air pollution-related problems.  Answer (a), on the other hand, incorrectly states that the UK's air pollution is responsible for 7 million premature deaths a year around the world. This is not accurate, as the article states that air pollution in general is responsible for 7 million premature deaths a year around the world, not just the UK's air pollution. Answer (a) also incorrectly states that the UK is taking legal action against the UK, which is nonsensical. Answer (a) does correctly mention that the main cause of the pollution is from road transport and residential emissions, and that the problem is exacerbated by the fact that 6 out of 10 cars sold in the UK are diesel vehicles. However, this information is also included in Answer (b).  Therefore, Answer (b) is better.
