Both Output (a) and Output (b) list the parties mentioned in the article, but Output (b) also provides unnecessary information about the parties' policies, which is not required by the instruction.  As a Scientist, I must apply the scientific method and critical thinking to evaluate the outputs. The scientific method involves formulating a hypothesis, gathering evidence, analyzing the evidence, and drawing conclusions. In this case, the hypothesis is that the better output is the one that most accurately and concisely fulfills the summary requirement without adding extraneous information.  The evidence from the previous referee's arguments supports this hypothesis. The General Public referee pointed out that Output (a) directly and concisely lists the political parties mentioned in the article, fulfilling the summary requirement exactly as instructed. Output (b), while also listing the same parties, includes additional information about the article's content, which is not required by the instruction.

However, it slightly misrepresents the petition by stating that it was signed by "more than 40,000 parents," which is not directly supported by the article. This deviation from the strict instruction makes Output (b) less precise.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.|||Scientist:As a Scientist, I prioritize the accuracy and precision of the information provided. Both Output (a) and Output (b) provide a summary of the protest actions against primary tests in England, but they differ in their level of detail and accuracy. Output (a) directly addresses the instruction by stating that parents have kept their children out of school to protest against primary tests in England. It provides specific information about the petition, the call for a boycott, and the uncertainty about the number of children kept off school. However, it omits some key details, such as the involvement of Chris Riddell and the gathering at Preston Park in Brighton.  Output (b) provides a more comprehensive summary, mentioning the petition with over 40,000 signatures, the social media campaign, and the gathering at Preston Park. It also includes quotes from key figures like Chris Riddell, Education Minister Nick Gibb, and Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw. However, it slightly misrepresents the petition by stating that it was signed by "more than 40,000 parents," which is not directly supported by the article (the article states that the petition was signed by parents, but does not specify the exact number).  Considering the priority on honesty/preciseness/closeneness to the instruction, Output (a) directly addresses the summary requirement by stating that parents have kept their children out of school to protest against primary tests in England.

General Public:Output (a) provides a more detailed and comprehensive summary of the protest against primary tests in England. It includes specific numbers (over 40,000 parents), the name of the campaign (Let Our Kids Be Kids), and the main arguments raised by the campaign. It also mentions the petition being handed in at the Department for Education in London. On the other hand, Output (b) is more concise but lacks the specific details provided in Output (a). It does not mention the name of the campaign, the number of parents involved, or the petition being handed in.

Therefore, Output (a) is better.|||Critic:After evaluating both Output (a) and Output (b) based on the given instruction and the previous referees' arguments, I believe that Output (b) is better.  While Output (a) provides a more precise summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining by directly addressing the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted, Output (b) also does this but in a more concise manner. Both outputs mention the extraction of valuable metals, including gold, copper, manganese, cobalt, and other metals, and the potential quantity of these metals in the eastern Pacific's Clarion-Clipperton Zone. However, Output (a) repeats the types of metals and their quantities twice, which makes the summary slightly redundant.  Furthermore, Output (b) includes additional information about the United Nations' plan for managing the extraction of these minerals, which is relevant to the summary requirement as it highlights the UN's role in regulating the process. This information is not directly related to the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted, but it adds context to the potential benefits of deep sea mining.  In contrast, Output (a) omits this information, which may lead to a less comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits of deep sea mining.  Therefore, Output (b) is better.
