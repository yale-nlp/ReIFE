## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The conflict between the Ethiopian government and forces in the Tigray region is a complex one with a long history. The main factors that led to the conflict are a power struggle, political reforms, and an election. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) was once at the center of power in Ethiopia but was sidelined by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed when he took office in 2018. Abiy pursued reforms, which Tigray resisted, leading to a political crisis. The crisis escalated when Tigray defied the central government by holding its own regional election in September, which the central government deemed illegal. Tensions further increased when the central government suspended funding for and cut ties with Tigray, leading to a "declaration of war" by Tigray's administration. The conflict began on November 4th when Abiy ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray, accusing them of attacking a military base.    **Therefore, Answer (a) is better.**    **Explanation:**    In my opinion, Answer (a) is better because it more accurately summarizes the main factors that led to the conflict and provides a more concise overview of the events that unfolded.

## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The article discusses the growing desire for anonymity on the internet and two apps, Secret and Whisper, that are designed to provide this. While both apps have their merits, I believe that Answer (a) is better.    The founders of Secret argue that their app is not just about whistle-blowing, but also about providing a space for people to express themselves without fear of reprisal. They believe that the app can train people in empathy, allowing them to share feelings that can't be expressed publicly. This perspective is more aligned with the overall theme of the article, which is about the impact of anonymity on the internet.    Answer (b) focuses primarily on the potential drawbacks of Secret, such as its lack of privacy and the potential for misuse. While these concerns are valid, they do not necessarily undermine the overall purpose of the app.    Therefore, **Answer (a) is better.**
## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The article discusses the growing desire for anonymity on the web and the potential impact of apps like Secret and Whisper on this trend. While I understand the founders' perspective on empathy and the potential for positive social interaction, I believe that the practical realities of anonymity on these platforms are more nuanced and problematic than their rosy outlook suggests.    **Answer (a):**    The founders of Secret argue that their app is primarily about empathy and training users to be more empathetic. They point out that Facebook has trained users to curate their identity and that Secret can help us unlearn this habit and be more open and vulnerable. However, I find this argument to be overly simplistic and fail to acknowledge the potential for harm and misuse associated with the app. The fact that Secret allows users to share information anonymously does not mean that it is immune to abuse or manipulation. Additionally, the potential for leaks and the potential for users to be identified despite the app's promises of anonymity raise serious concerns about the app's viability and its potential impact on individuals.    **Answer (b):**    The founders of Secret argue that their app provides a platform for users to share information and feelings anonymously without the fear of being identified. While I understand the desire for anonymity and the potential benefits of such a platform, I believe that the practical implementation of this idea is flawed. The app's reliance on phone contacts and the potential for leaks undermine its claims of anonymity. Additionally, the app's focus on gossip and trivial information rather than meaningful or substantive content raises questions about its purpose and impact.    **Therefore, Answer (a) is better.**    While I appreciate the founders' intention to foster empathy and open communication, I believe that the practical realities of anonymity on Secret are more problematic than their rosy outlook suggests. The app's potential for abuse, manipulation, and leaks outweighs its potential benefits.
## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The article discusses the growing desire for anonymity on the web and the emergence of apps like Secret and Whisper that aim to provide this.

The article highlights the potential for misappropriation of information and the potential for legal issues related to privacy and data protection. It also points out that the anonymity promised by these apps is often illusory, as they often require users to provide personal information in order to function or engage with the platform.    Therefore, I believe that while Secret may offer a platform for users to share their thoughts and experiences anonymously, the practical limitations and potential risks associated with this anonymity should be carefully considered before relying on these apps.    **Therefore, Answer (a) is better.**

## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The article discusses the controversial topic of abortion in Malta. The author argues that the current laws in Malta are restrictive and harmful to women. He highlights the stories of several women who have been affected by these laws, including one who bled for 40 days after an abortion and another who was coerced into terminating her pregnancy. The author also discusses the arguments of those who are opposed to abortion, but ultimately argues that the benefits of abortion outweigh the risks.    **Answer (a):**    Bardon is against abortion because he believes it is a "horrible crime" and the child should not be sacrificed. This answer is concise and accurately summarizes the main point of Bardon's argument. However, it does not address the fact that Bardon also believes that abortion is not socially acceptable and that Maltese law safeguards the lives of sick pregnant women.    **Answer (b):**    Klaus Vella Bardon, deputy chairman of the LifeNetwork Foundation Malta, is against abortion because he believes it is not socially acceptable, Maltese law safeguards the lives of sick pregnant women, and the child should not be sacrificed in cases of rape. This answer is more comprehensive and addresses all of the main points of Bardon's argument.

## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The article describes Sir Lenny Henry's decision to record a blues album and the influence of the Sky Arts documentary "Lenny Henry's Got The Blues" on that decision. The article is well-written and provides a comprehensive overview of the topic.    **Assistant A's Answer:**    The Sky Arts documentary "Lenny Henry's Got The Blues" had a big influence on Sir Lenny Henry's decision to record an album of blues music.

## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The new VAT rules brought in by HM Revenue and Customs on 1 January have significantly impacted EU specialist online retailers and international shipping companies. While some firms have opted to temporarily close their stores to UK-based customers or impose additional charges, others have decided to continue operations but with increased costs and bureaucracy.    The measures taken by retailers include stopping deliveries to the UK altogether, as seen with Dutch Bike Bits and Beer On Web, or temporarily closing their store until their UK VAT registration is complete, as Scandinavian Outdoor has done. These measures are understandable given the increased costs and administrative burden associated with complying with the new VAT rules.    International shipping companies, such as Federal Express and TNT, have also implemented additional charges to reflect the increased investment they have had to make in adjusting their systems to cope with Brexit. These charges are necessary to offset the additional costs incurred due to the changes in VAT regulations.    Therefore, **Answer (a)** is better. It provides a more comprehensive summary of the measures taken by retailers and shipping companies in response to the new VAT rules, while also highlighting the potential impact on consumers and businesses.

## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The article discusses various definitions of collusion provided by different individuals. I believe the most appropriate definition is the one given by Lord Stevens, which encompasses a wide range of actions from the wilful failure to keep records to the extreme of agents being involved in murder. This definition is broad enough to encompass the various aspects of collusion as described in the article, while also being clear and concise.    **Therefore, Answer (a) is better.**
## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The article discusses various definitions of collusion and the people who provided them. I would summarize the key points as follows:    * **Sir John Stevens:** Defines collusion as ranging from the wilful failure to keep records to the extreme of agents being involved in murder.   * **Peter Cory:** Defines collusion as having a secret understanding, deliberately ignoring, overlooking, disregarding, passing over, taking no notice of, turning a blind eye, winking, excusing, condoning, looking the other way, and letting something ride.   * **Nuala O'Loan:** Adopts the definitions of Stevens and Cory.   * **Al Hutchinson:** Applies a less broad definition, requiring the presence of an agreement between two or more parties and evidence of deliberate action.   * **Sir Christopher de Silva:** Uses a working definition less broad than Cory's and more in line with the Billy Wright inquiry panel.   * **Peter Smithwick:** Gives a similar definition to Cory, encompassing both the commission of an act and the omission or failure to act.    **Therefore, Answer (a) is better.**    The definition provided by Stevens and O'Loan is more comprehensive and covers a wider range of scenarios than the definition provided by Hutchinson. While Hutchinson's definition is more specific and focuses on the requirement of deliberate action, it may not be as applicable in cases where the focus is on omissions or failures to act. The definitions provided by de Silva and Smithwick are more aligned with the definition provided by Stevens and O'Loan, but they do not explicitly mention the element of deliberate action. Overall, the definition provided by Stevens and O'Loan is more appropriate for the purpose of this article, as it is more comprehensive and covers a wider range of scenarios.
## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The article discusses various definitions of collusion provided by different individuals and organizations. The commonalities among these definitions include the presence of an agreement or arrangement between parties, the intention to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose, and the element of deliberate omission or inaction.    **Answer (a):**    The definition provided by Answer (a) accurately summarizes the main points of consensus among the different definitions of collusion. It correctly states that collusion involves an agreement or arrangement to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose and highlights the inclusion of both positive actions and deliberate omissions in the definition.    **Answer (b):**    Answer (b) provides a more detailed summary of the different definitions, but it does not capture the essence of the consensus as clearly as Answer (a). While it mentions the presence of an agreement or arrangement and the intention to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose, it does not emphasize the importance of deliberate omission or inaction as a key element of collusion.    **Therefore, Answer (a) is better.**    The definition provided by Answer (a) is more concise, accurate, and captures the main points of consensus more effectively. It provides a clear and concise summary of the different definitions of collusion, highlighting the key elements that are commonly agreed upon.
## Evaluation    The article presents various definitions of collusion provided by different individuals. The commonalities among these definitions include the presence of an agreement or arrangement between parties to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose. Many definitions also encompass the deliberate ignoring or turning a blind eye to a known wrongdoing or misbehavior, the withholding of intelligence and evidence, and the failure to keep records or take action against a known wrongdoing.    However, there are some differences in emphasis between the various definitions. For example, some definitions focus primarily on the act of conspiring or conniving, while others also include omissions or failures to act. Additionally, some definitions emphasize the need for a sufficient evidence to establish the deliberate nature of the act or omission, while others do not.    Based on my evaluation, I believe that **Answer (a)** is better. While Answer (b) accurately summarizes the commonalities among the definitions, it does not delve as deeply into the differences between the definitions as Answer (a). Answer (a) provides a more comprehensive overview of the various definitions of collusion and highlights the key elements that are common to most of them.

The majority of these definitions encompass an agreement or arrangement to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose, the deliberate ignoring or turning a blind eye to wrongdoing, and the withholding of intelligence or evidence. While there are some minor variations in the specific wording and emphasis between definitions, the overall themes remain consistent.    **Answer (a):**    The summary accurately highlights the similarities of the definitions provided by different people in the article. It correctly identifies the key elements of collusion as agreements, arrangements, or actions intended to achieve unlawful or improper objectives, and the deliberate ignoring or turning a blind eye to improper or unlawful activity. The summary also mentions the withholding of intelligence and evidence, and the failure to keep records or take action against a known wrongdoing as common elements in many definitions.    **Answer (b):**    While the summary accurately identifies some similarities between the definitions, it does not delve as deeply into the nuances of each definition. For example, the summary does not mention the requirement of intent in some definitions, or the distinction between deliberate omissions and negligent or inadvertent acts. Additionally, the summary does not provide enough contrast between the different definitions, making it difficult to compare and contrast their respective strengths and weaknesses.    **Therefore, Answer (a) is better.**    The summary of Answer (a) is more concise, accurate, and comprehensive in capturing the similarities of the definitions provided by different people in the article.

## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The new PNR directive aims to prevent terrorism and other serious crimes by establishing a joint system for police and justice officials to access airline passenger data. While the directive has the potential to improve crime prevention, there are valid concerns and opposition surrounding its implementation.    The European Digital Rights (EDRI) campaign group and the European Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) raise valid concerns about the data retention period and the potential for discriminatory profiling. Critics argue that the EU should focus on improving intelligence-sharing between police forces rather than collecting PNR data. These concerns are valid and should be carefully considered when evaluating the overall impact of the directive.    However, the directive does include some safeguards to protect privacy. For example, the PIUs are obligated to delete any data that reveals a person's race, religion, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life. Additionally, there is a ban on automatic data transfer from PIUs to other countries, ensuring that data is only shared in accordance with the directive's guidelines.    Taking all factors into account, **Answer (a)** is better. While Answer (b) summarizes the concerns and opposition more comprehensively, it does not provide as much detail or analysis as Answer (a). Answer (a) is more concise, well-structured, and provides a more balanced overview of the issue, taking into account the potential benefits and drawbacks of the directive.    Therefore, **Answer (a) is better.**
## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The new PNR directive aims to prevent terrorism and other serious crimes by establishing a joint system for police and justice officials to access airline passenger data. While the directive has some merit, there are several concerns and objections raised by the public.    The main concerns include the potential for discriminatory profiling, the lack of effectiveness in combating terrorism, and the infringement of privacy rights. Critics argue that PNR was irrelevant in the Paris and Brussels bombings and that the EU should focus on improving intelligence-sharing between police forces rather than collecting data on passengers.    The European Digital Rights (EDRI) campaign group and the European Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) have raised valid concerns about the data retention period and the potential for discriminatory profiling. The ECJ struck down a similar directive in 2014 due to privacy concerns. The inclusion of sensitive information such as race, religion, and sexual life in PNR data further exacerbates these concerns.    **Therefore, Answer (a) is better.** Although Answer (b) summarizes the concerns more comprehensively, it does not provide a clear conclusion or recommendation. Answer (a) clearly states the concerns and objections raised by the public and concludes with a clear statement of which answer is better.
## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The new PNR directive aims to prevent terrorism and other serious crimes by establishing a joint system for police and justice officials to access airline passenger data. While the directive addresses concerns about data privacy, it raises several valid points of concern.    The European Digital Rights (EDRI) campaign group argues that the five-year data retention period is too long and may lead to discriminatory profiling of individuals. The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) emphasizes the need for statistical analysis to detect any discrimination and measure the importance of PNR in crime investigations. Critics point out that PNR was irrelevant in the Paris and Brussels bombings and suggest that the EU should focus on improving intelligence-sharing between police forces.    Considering the above concerns and my own analysis of the text, I believe that **Answer (a)** is better. It provides a more concise and accurate summary of the concerns and opposition from the public about the new PNR directive, while also highlighting the key points of concern more effectively. Answer (b) includes some additional details and quotes, but it is less well-organized and does not flow as smoothly as Answer (a).    Therefore, **Answer (a) is better.**
## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The new PNR directive aims to prevent terrorism and other serious crimes by establishing a joint system for police and justice officials to access airline passenger data. The directive covers a wide range of passenger details, including names, contact details, itinerary, credit card information, baggage information, and passport details.    The main concerns and opposition from the public about the new PNR directive are:    * **Privacy concerns:** The directive collects sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, and sexual life. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has struck down an EU data retention directive in 2014, citing concerns about privacy rights.   * **Lack of effectiveness:** Critics argue that PNR was irrelevant in the Paris and Brussels bombings and that the directive is an ineffective tool against terrorism.   * **Discrimination:** There are concerns that the directive may lead to discriminatory profiling of individuals.    **Therefore, Answer (a) is better.**    **Explanation:**    Answer (a) provides a more concise and well-organized summary of the concerns and opposition from the public about the new PNR directive. It clearly lists the concerns raised by the European Digital Rights (EDRI) campaign group and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), as well as the concerns of critics. The summary is also more objective and neutral, as it does not express personal opinions or make assumptions about the effectiveness of the directive.
## Evaluation    **My Answer:**    The new curriculum for Wales is a comprehensive overhaul of the education system for children in Wales. It follows a consultation in 2019 and aims to improve the quality of education and prepare children for the future. The biggest changes are in secondary schools, where subjects will be incorporated into six "areas of learning and experience." The curriculum also sets out "what matters" and "progression steps" for each learning area.    However, the curriculum does not set out a detailed plan for exactly what schools should be teaching. This leaves room for interpretation and potential inconsistencies. The lack of clarity and the need for additional training for teachers are concerns that need to be addressed.    **Assistant A's Answer:**    Assistant A summarizes the new curriculum well, but it lacks detail and does not include some important information.

The six areas of learning and experience are clearly defined and provide a clear roadmap for schools to follow. The inclusion of life skills, communication, teamwork, and collaborative learning is a positive step, as these skills are essential for children to develop in order to be successful in school and in life.    **Assistant B's Answer:**    The new curriculum for Wales is a much-needed overhaul of the education system. The six areas of learning and experience are well-designed and provide a more holistic approach to education. However, the lack of detail in the curriculum and the absence of mandatory subjects such as Welsh and English are concerning. The inclusion of life skills and the option for head teachers to have discretion over English language learning up to age seven are positive aspects of the curriculum.    **Conclusion:**    While both Assistant A and Assistant B provide well-written summaries of the new curriculum, I believe that Answer (a) is better. The summary is more concise and clearly outlines the key points of the curriculum, while also providing a more comprehensive overview of the changes that are being made.
