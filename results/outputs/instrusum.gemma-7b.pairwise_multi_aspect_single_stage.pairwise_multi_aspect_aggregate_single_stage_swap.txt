The inclusion of information about the center's impact on the local businesses and the potential for its future development is also commendable.    **Output (b)** focuses primarily on the artistic merit of the opening line-up, emphasizing the inclusion of contemporary, intelligent works and the showcasing of artists from various countries. While this is important, it does not fully address the center's broader goals and objectives. The lack of information about the center's potential economic and social impact is also notable.
