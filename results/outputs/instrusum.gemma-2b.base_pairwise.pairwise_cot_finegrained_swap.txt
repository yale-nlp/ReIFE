The reforms caused unease among critics in Tigray, who saw them as an attempt to undermine the region's autonomy and identity.    **Final Decision:**   Therefore, Output (a) is better.
**Output (a) is better.**    Ethiopia's political evolution has undergone significant changes in recent years. The country has undergone a series of political reforms aimed at promoting democracy and addressing human rights concerns. While there have been positive developments, such as the signing of a peace treaty with Eritrea and the appointment of a Nobel Peace Prize winner as Prime Minister, the country has also faced challenges, including the ongoing conflict in the Tigray region.    The Tigray conflict began as a response to the government's perceived attempts to centralize power and suppress political dissent. The central government's decision to postpone national elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated tensions. Tigray's defiance of the central government and its subsequent military offensive have resulted in widespread displacement and civilian casualties.    The central government's actions have also been seen as an attempt to exert undue influence over Tigray, which has a significant population and history. The conflict has raised concerns about the erosion of ethnic federalism and the potential for further regional conflicts.    Therefore, Output (a) is better as it provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to the conflict in Ethiopia.
**Output (a) is better.**    Ethiopia's political history has been marked by a federal system that has allowed the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) to exert significant influence. Abiy Ahmed's reforms, including the release of political prisoners and the holding of a regional election in Tigray, have been met with resistance from the TPLF. The central government's decision to suspend funding and cut ties with Tigray has further escalated the conflict. Additionally, the ethnic tensions between Tigray and the central government have contributed to the instability. Therefore, Output (a) is better as it addresses the root causes of the conflict and provides a more comprehensive solution to the crisis.
**Output (a) is better.**    The timeline demonstrates a clear pattern of events leading to the current conflict in Ethiopia. Abiy's reforms, particularly the Tigray peace deal and the liberalisation of politics, created a fragile peace that was easily disrupted by the TPLF's refusal to participate in his new government. This, combined with the government's decision to suspend funding and cut ties with Tigray, created the perfect conditions for the conflict to escalate. Additionally, the presence of a strong and well-equipped military force in Tigray, combined with the ethnic tensions and historical grievances between the Tigray people and the central government, further exacerbated the situation.
**Output (a) is better.**    Ethiopia's political evolution has undergone significant changes since the country gained independence in 1991. The country transitioned from a military regime to a democratic system, and then experienced a period of political reforms and ethnic reconciliation. However, the country has faced challenges in recent years, including the Tigray conflict, which began in 2015 and has escalated in recent months.    The Tigray conflict has had a devastating impact on Ethiopia, with hundreds of thousands of people killed and millions displaced. The conflict has also exacerbated ethnic tensions in the country, and has raised concerns about the future of democracy and human rights in Ethiopia.    The central government's actions in response to the Tigray conflict have also been controversial. Some critics argue that the government has been too slow to act and that it has been more concerned with maintaining its power than with protecting the rights of its citizens. Others argue that the government's actions have been effective and that the conflict is a result of the government's unwillingness to negotiate.    Ultimately, the Tigray conflict is a complex and multifaceted issue. There is no easy solution to the conflict, and the outcome of the conflict will depend on a variety of factors, including the willingness of the Ethiopian government to negotiate, the support of the international community, and the willingness of the people of Ethiopia to come together and find a peaceful solution.

Therefore, Output (a) is better.
**Output (a) is better.**    The decline of the Bridgend engine plant is part of a larger shift that has been taking place since the early 1990s. In 2008, Ford decided to operate as a global company, which meant standardizing models across the world and investing in the most efficient plants. This put pressure on the Bridgend plant, which had to compete with other Ford engine plants globally. When Ford stopped assembling cars in the UK, this made the landscape even more challenging for Bridgend. Now, engines made in Bridgend are shipped all over the world to be put into cars before being sent back to showrooms in the UK. With Brexit on the horizon, factories making engines in the UK will have to be even more efficient to stay open. Therefore, Output (a) is better because it provides a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to the decline of the Bridgend engine plant.
**Output (a) is better.**    The Bridgend engine plant faced a significant decline due to the shift in global focus and competition from other Ford engine plants. The plant's reliance on a single customer, Jaguar, and the increasing cost of production due to Brexit put immense pressure on its survival.
