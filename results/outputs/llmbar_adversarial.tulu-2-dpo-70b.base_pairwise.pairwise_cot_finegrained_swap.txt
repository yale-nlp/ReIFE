In Output (b), the explanation for "they" in sentence (a) is not accurate, as it suggests that "they" refers to the demonstrators, while it should refer to the authorities. 2. Output (a) provides a more accurate explanation for both sentences, correctly identifying that "they" refers to the authorities in sentence (a) and the demonstrators in sentence (b).  Explanation and Rationale: Output (b) contains an inaccurate explanation for the first sentence, which does not precisely execute the instruction. Output (a) provides a more accurate and clear explanation for both sentences, correctly identifying the antecedent of "they" in each case. This is crucial for addressing the instruction, as the task is to determine the correct antecedent for "they" in each sentence.  Furthermore, Output (a) provides a more coherent and complete explanation, as it not only identifies the correct antecedent but also explains why it is the most likely antecedent based on the semantics of the sentence. This additional information helps to better understand the context and the reasoning behind the choice.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Differences Identification: 1. In Output (b), all words are capitalized, while in Output (a), only the first letter of each sentence is capitalized.  Explanation and Rationale: The instruction specifically mentions that the person has a form of dyslexia where it is hard to see the boundaries of words if they are not capitalized. Therefore, the primary goal is to make the text easier to read for the person with dyslexia.  Output (b) capitalizes all words, which might make it easier for the person to distinguish between words. However, this approach is not consistent with standard writing conventions, which only capitalize the first letter of each sentence and proper nouns.  Output (a) capitalizes the first letter of each sentence, adhering to standard writing conventions while still providing the necessary differentiation between words for the person with dyslexia. This approach balances the need for readability with the standard writing format, making it more coherent and less overwhelming for the reader.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.
