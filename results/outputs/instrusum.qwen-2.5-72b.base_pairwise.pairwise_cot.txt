Output (a) is more general and does not provide the specific quantities of metals that could be extracted. Therefore, Output (b) is better.
Output (a) provides a more detailed and specific summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It also mentions the eastern Pacific as a potential source of these metals, which is relevant to the article. Output (b) is more general and does not provide the specific quantities of metals that can be extracted, nor does it mention the eastern Pacific. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Output (a) provides a more detailed and specific summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It also mentions the role of the United Nations' International Seabed Authority in managing the extraction and sharing the proceeds with developing countries. Output (b), while mentioning the potential for extracting valuable metals, does not provide the specific types and quantities of metals that can be extracted, and it introduces concerns about environmental impact, which is not part of the summary requirement. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Output (a) provides a more precise and detailed summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the specific types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It directly addresses the summary requirement by focusing on the potential benefits and the types and quantities of metals. Output (b), while mentioning the potential for extracting metals, also introduces concerns about environmental impact, which is not part of the summary requirement. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Both outputs provide a summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. However, Output (b) provides a bit more context by mentioning that the United Nations has published its first plan for managing the extraction of these minerals and that companies could apply for licenses from as soon as 2016. This additional information is relevant to the summary requirement and provides a more complete picture of the situation. Therefore, Output (b) is better.
