Output (a) is better.  In both Output (a) and Output (b), "they" could refer to either the authorities or the demonstrators as the antecedent. However, Output (a) provides a more accurate and coherent explanation by stating that "they" likely refers to the authorities in sentence (a) and to the demonstrators in sentence (b). This is because it makes little sense for the demonstrators to fear violence and for that to cause the authorities to deny authorization. In contrast, Output (b) does not provide a clear and logical explanation for the antecedent of "they" in sentence (b).
After evaluating the two outputs, I found that Output (a) is better. The reason for this is that Output (a) closely executes the instruction by providing a formatted version of the text, while Output (b) does not provide the requested formatting.
