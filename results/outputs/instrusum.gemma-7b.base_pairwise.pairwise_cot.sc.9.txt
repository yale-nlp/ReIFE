**Evaluation:**    Output (a) more accurately and closely executes the instruction, which is to summarize the key statistics regarding the fire staff's mental health issues mentioned in the article. While Output (b) provides additional information about the prevalence of mental health issues among emergency service personnel, it deviates from the instruction by discussing the survey results and the potential impact on individuals.    Therefore, **Output (a) is better.**
**Evaluation:**    Output (a) is better. While both outputs accurately summarize the key statistics regarding fire staff mental health issues, Output (a) provides a more concise and focused summary, focusing primarily on the number of staff taking long-term sick leave due to mental illness. Output (b), on the other hand, includes additional information such as the survey results showing the prevalence of stress, low mood, and suicidal thoughts among emergency service personnel.

Output (b) provides some examples of couples who died shortly after their loved ones, but does not delve into the scientific evidence or discuss the medical condition of "broken heart syndrome."    Therefore, **Output (a) is better**.
**Explanation:**    Both Output (a) and Output (b) summarize the quoted persons' views accurately and comprehensively. However, Output (a) is more concise and organized, while Output (b) includes more details and citations.

**Explanation:**    Output (b) is better. The article discusses the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the extraction of large quantities of metals such as manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt from the ocean floor. The article also mentions the environmental impact of deep sea mining, but it primarily focuses on the potential benefits. Therefore, Output (b) is better as it more accurately summarizes the main point of the article, which is to discuss the potential benefits of deep sea mining.    **Therefore, Output (b) is better.**
**Explanation:**    Output (a) more accurately and precisely executes the instruction, which is to summarize the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. The text clearly states the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the large quantities of metals that can be extracted from the ocean floor. It also mentions the potential environmental impact of deep sea mining and the concerns raised by scientists.    Therefore, **Output (a) is better.**
**Evaluation:**    Output (a) more precisely and accurately executes the instruction, as it clearly summarizes the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted, as requested in the summary requirement. Output (b) may be factually accurate, but it does not strictly adhere to the instruction's requirement of summarizing the potential benefits of deep sea mining.    Therefore, **Output (a) is better.**
**Evaluation:**    Output (a) more precisely executes the instruction, as it succinctly summarizes the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted, as requested in the summary requirement. While Output (b) also mentions the potential benefits, it includes additional information about the environmental impact, which is not relevant to the requirement.    **Therefore, Output (a) is better.**
**Evaluation:**    Output (a) more accurately and closely executes the instruction, which is to summarize the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. The summary in Output (a) is more concise and focused on the key points of the article, while Output (b) includes additional information that is not relevant to the instruction.    **Therefore, Output (a) is better.**
