Output (b) is better because it includes the names of the quoted individuals and provides a brief summary of their statements, albeit without specifying their roles. Although it omits the identities of the individuals, it still gives a general idea of the perspectives presented in the article. In contrast, Output (a) fails to summarize the content of the quotes and does not provide any context for the readers to understand the relevance of the individuals' statements. Therefore, Output (b) is better.
Output (a) is better.  Explanation: Although both outputs mention the identities of the quoted individuals, Output (a) provides a more concise and accurate summary of the key points made by these individuals within the context of the article. It highlights Martin Adams's comment on the普遍 nature of air pollution issues, Frank Kelly's perspective on the role of diesel vehicles, and Joe Hennon's statement on the health impact and the "invisible killer" metaphor. Output (b) omits some of the specific details from the quotes, such as the connection between air pollution and premature deaths, and the need for a shift to less polluting transport. Therefore, Output (a) more closely executes the instruction by summarizing the article based on the quoted people and their identities.

Output (b) is better. Although it does not provide a complete summary of all the information from the quoted individuals, it does include relevant statements from three key sources in the article: Martin Adams, Frank Kelly, and Joe Hennon. These statements give a sense of their perspectives on the air pollution issue in the UK. Output (a), on the other hand, merely lists the identities of the individuals and the organization they represent without summarizing their contributions to the article. Therefore, Output (b) more closely executes the instruction by providing a limited summary of the quoted people's statements.
Output (b) more closely follows the instruction by focusing on the identities of the quoted individuals without including their statements or opinions. It accurately summarizes the key sources in the article, which is the main requirement of the instruction.
