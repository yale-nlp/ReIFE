Explanation: The article discusses the history of theatres in London during Shakespeare's time, including The Theatre, The Curtain, the original and reconstructed Globe theatres, and The Rose. The Theatre, built in 1576, was the first purpose-built home for drama in Britain since Roman times and may have been where Romeo and Juliet was first performed. The Curtain, built a year later, has had its foundations located during excavation work, and a major redevelopment has been approved by Hackney Council to include a permanent display of the Curtain's foundations. The Rose, opened in 1587, is thought to have hosted Titus Andronicus, one of Shakespeare's earliest plays. The original Globe theatre was founded by Shakespeare's theatre group in 1599, of which the location was identified only in the late 1980s. The reconstructed Globe theatre was opened in 1997.

The article explores the question of why we haven't made contact with extraterrestrial life despite the high probability of its existence. The possible explanations for this include the Fermi paradox, which highlights the lack of evidence for intelligent life despite high estimates, and the Rare Earth hypothesis, which argues that the unique and intricate design of our planet makes life elsewhere almost impossible. Additionally, some scientists believe that the window of opportunity for other civilizations to have similar technology as ours is incredibly small, making contact unlikely. Another theory suggests that with intelligence comes self-destruction, implying that advanced civilizations may have destroyed themselves before making contact. Finally, some argue that the human race is either an accidental blip in the universe or that the conditions we evolved in were unique, making the existence of other intelligent life improbable.  Therefore, Output (b) is better.

The article discusses different definitions of collusion provided by various individuals. Sir John Stevens, the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, defines collusion as ranging from the wilful failure to keep records to the extreme of agents being involved in murder. Canadian judge Peter Cory also provides a definition of collusion, highlighting several dictionary definitions, including "to co-operate secretly" and "to have a secret understanding." Cory also adds definitions of connive, a synonym of the verb collude, including "to deliberately ignore" and "to turn a blind eye." The first police ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala O'Loan, adopted the definitions of Stevens and Cory, concluding that there had been collusion in the murder of Raymond McCord jnr. However, her successor as police ombudsman, Al Hutchinson, applied a less broad definition in his report on the attack on McGurk's Bar.
