Considering both outputs have their strengths and weaknesses, I argue that Output (a) is better suited for an audience familiar with the topic of air pollution, as it provides a more detailed and concise summary of the article's content.  On the other hand, Output (b) is better suited for a general audience who may not be familiar with technical terms related to air pollution, as it uses simpler language and provides a broader perspective on the article's content.  Therefore, Output (a) is better for an audience familiar with the topic of air pollution, while Output (b) is better for a general audience who may not be familiar with technical terms related to air pollution.

Output (b) not only lists four specific points, but also provides additional context and explanations that help to further understand the issue of air pollution in the UK. For example, it explains that the dust from the Sahara is not the only cause of the pollution, but also mentions the impact of industrial pollution from Europe. Additionally, it provides more specific information about the EU's legal action against the UK and the number of premature deaths caused by air pollution.  Furthermore, Output (b) uses more varied and precise vocabulary than Output (a). For instance, it uses terms like "particulate matter," "nitrogen dioxide," and "sulphur dioxide" to describe the pollutants, whereas Output (a) simply says "various substances."  Therefore, Output (b) is better.  However, I do agree with the previous referee that Output (a) uses more concise language and avoids unnecessary repetition. But in my opinion, the additional context and information provided in Output (b) outweigh its slightly longer length.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (a) is better.  My reasoning is as follows:  Output (a) provides a more comprehensive summary of the article's key points. It covers five specific points, including the cause of the high air pollution levels, the most common pollutants in the UK, the World Health Organization's recommendations for safe exposure levels, the UK's persistent exceeding of safe limits, and the serious health impacts of air pollution.  On the other hand, Output (b) only covers four points, and one of those points (the tipping point for the pollution increase) is not even mentioned in the article. Additionally, Output (b) lacks specific details and numbers, such as the recommended safe exposure levels and the number of premature deaths due to air pollution.

My reasoning is as follows:  Output (a) provides a more comprehensive summary of the article's key points. It covers five specific points, including the cause of the high air pollution levels, the most common pollutants in the UK, the World Health Organization's recommendations for safe exposure levels, the impact of the shift to diesel vehicles, and the global and national premature death toll due to air pollution.  On the other hand, Output (b) only covers four points, and the fourth point is not as specific as Output (a)'s fourth point. Output (b) does not mention the World Health Organization's recommendations for safe exposure levels, which I believe is an important aspect of the article.  Furthermore, Output (a) presents the information in a more organized and clear manner, with each point being a separate sentence. Output (b) combines multiple points into a single sentence, which can make it harder to follow.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.|||Critic:  As a Critic, I have carefully evaluated both outputs and considered the previous referees' arguments. I agree with the General Public's decision that Output (a) is better, and I will explain why.  Output (a) provides a more comprehensive summary of the article's key points, covering five specific points that are all relevant to the topic of air pollution in the UK. The points are well-organized and presented in clear, separate sentences that are easy to follow. In contrast, Output (b) only covers four points, and the fourth point is not as specific as Output (a)'s fourth point. Additionally, Output (b) combines multiple points into a single sentence, which can make it harder to follow.  Furthermore, Output (a) uses better wording and sentence structure, making it easier to understand and more fluent to read. For example, Output (a) uses phrases such as "the most common pollutants in the UK" and "the World Health Organization recommends mean exposure over 24 hours to PM2.5 of no more than 10 micrograms/m3," which are clear and concise. In contrast, Output (b) uses phrases such as "most air pollution in the UK comes from road transport and residential emissions" and "air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths a year worldwide," which are not as clear and concise.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.  However, I do have some suggestions for improvement for both outputs. For Output (a), it would be helpful to include more specific examples of the actions that can be taken to reduce air pollution, such as implementing traffic restrictions or promoting the use of electric vehicles. For Output (b), it would be helpful to provide more context for the reader, such as explaining what PM2.5 and PM10 are and why they are important indicators of air pollution.  Overall, both outputs have done a good job of summarizing the key points of the article, but Output (a) stands out for its comprehensive coverage, clear writing, and well-organized structure.|||Scientist:  As a Scientist, I have carefully evaluated both outputs and considered the previous referees' arguments.

Please provide your evaluation and explain why you think one of the outputs is better than the other.  Also, please note that you should not simply repeat what the previous referees have said. Instead, you should provide your own unique insights and perspectives on the two outputs.  Finally, remember to conclude your evaluation by stating which output is better and why.  Thank you.
General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (a) is better.  My reasoning is as follows:  Output (a) provides more specific and concrete statistics than Output (b). For example, it mentions that only 10% of smallholder farmers in Ghana have documentation proving their ownership rights, and that 80% of traditional chiefs are interested in Landmapp's service. These statistics give a clearer picture of the situation and help to illustrate the impact that Landmapp's technology can have.  In contrast, Output (b) provides more general statistics about the challenges faced by smallholder farmers in Africa, such as the fact that nearly two-thirds of the rural population lives on less than $1.25 a day. While these statistics are relevant to the topic, they do not directly relate to the specific technology solutions discussed in the article.  Therefore, Output (a) is better because it provides more relevant and specific statistics that support the article's main points.|||Critic:  As a Critic, I have carefully evaluated both outputs and considered the previous referees' arguments. While Output (a) provides specific statistics that relate directly to the technology solutions discussed in the article, Output (b) offers a broader perspective on the challenges faced by smallholder farmers in Africa.  After careful consideration, I have decided that Output (b) is better. My reasoning is as follows:  Output (b) provides a more comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by smallholder farmers in Africa, which sets the stage for understanding the impact of technology solutions like Landmapp and Freshmarte. By highlighting the broader context of poverty and lack of access to financial services, Output (b) helps readers appreciate the significance of the technology solutions discussed in the article.  Furthermore, Output (b) uses more precise language and sentence structure, making it easier to follow and understand. For example, the phrase "nearly two-thirds of the rural population in sub-Saharan Africa live on less than $1.25 a day" is more concise and clear than the equivalent statistic provided in Output (a).  Therefore, Output (b) is better because it provides a more comprehensive and well-written summary of the article's main points.|||Scientist:  As a Scientist, I have carefully evaluated both outputs and considered the previous referees' arguments.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (a) is better.  Output (a) provides a more comprehensive summary of the article, covering various aspects of the challenges faced by smallholder farmers in Africa, including land ownership, access to financial services, and the impact of technology. It also highlights the potential of technology in addressing these challenges, citing examples of innovative solutions such as Landmapp and Freshmarte. Additionally, it provides context on the significance of smallholder farmers in Africa, noting that they produce up to 90% of the continent's agricultural output.  On the other hand, Output (b) focuses primarily on the statistic that only 10% of smallholder farmers in Ghana have documentation proving their ownership rights. While this is an important point, it does not provide a comprehensive summary of the article's content.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (b) is better.  The main reason for my decision is that Output (b) provides a more comprehensive and detailed account of Chum Mey's experiences during the Khmer Rouge regime. It not only summarizes his experiences in Tuol Sleng prison but also provides additional information about his life before and after his imprisonment. This includes his marriage, the death of his son, and his eventual escape from the Khmer Rouge.  Furthermore, Output (b) also highlights the significance of Chum Mey's testimony in the trial of Kaing Guek Eav, the head of Tuol Sleng, and his efforts to ensure that the crimes committed during the Khmer Rouge regime are not forgotten. This additional context helps to provide a more complete picture of Chum Mey's experiences and the impact that the Khmer Rouge had on his life.  In contrast, Output (a) focuses primarily on Chum Mey's experiences in Tuol Sleng prison and does not provide as much context or detail about his life before and after his imprisonment. While it does mention his marriage and the death of his son, it does not provide the same level of detail as Output (b).

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (b) is better.  My reasoning is as follows:  Output (b) provides a clearer and more concise summary of the information about the theatres mentioned in the article. It lists all three theatres - The Theatre, The Curtain, and The Rose - and their locations, and also mentions the reconstructed Globe theatre. Additionally, it provides a brief history of each theatre, including the year they were built and their significance in Shakespeare's career.  On the other hand, Output (a) focuses more on the history of the theatres and their significance in Shakespeare's time, but does not provide a clear summary of the information. It jumps between different topics, such as the proposed new theatre on the site of The Theatre and the reconstructed Globe theatre, without connecting them logically.  Therefore, Output (b) is better because it provides a more organized and comprehensive summary of the information about the theatres mentioned in the article.  Output (b): This article discusses the theatres associated with William Shakespeare in London. It mentions The Theatre, the first purpose-built home for drama in Britain since Roman times, where Shakespeare made his home after moving from Warwickshire to London. It also mentions The Curtain, built about 100 yards to the south of The Theatre, and The Rose, opened before the Globe in 1587. The Globe theatre, located just down river of where Southwark Bridge now stands, is not to be confused with the reconstructed Shakespeare's Globe a few minutes away. The article also mentions Silver Street, Cripplegate, where Shakespeare lodged with a refugee Huguenot family in the early 1600s, and the massive underground car park which lurks beneath London Wall on the same spot.|||Critic:  As a Critic, I have carefully evaluated both outputs and considered the arguments presented by the previous referees.

While this information is interesting, it does not provide a clear overview of the timeline of events. Moreover, the lack of organization and structure in Output (a) makes it more difficult to follow and comprehend.  Therefore, Output (b) is better. Its clear and concise timeline format, combined with its relevance and context, make it a more valuable resource for anyone interested in the history of old London theatres.

The book serves as an outlet for these mothers to express their emotions and connect with others going through similar situations during lockdown."|||Critic:  As a Critic, I have carefully evaluated both outputs, and I have to say that I disagree with the previous referees' argument. After a thorough assessment, I believe that Output (b) is better.  Output (b) provides a more concise and focused summary of the article's main points. It clearly highlights the challenges faced by new mothers during the pandemic, such as feelings of isolation, uncertainty, and pressure on their mental health. Additionally, it emphasizes the positive aspects of the shared experience, such as the silver linings and positives that the mothers found in their experiences.  On the other hand, Output (a) seems to be more focused on the project's purpose and the book's availability, which, while important, are not the main points of the article. It also uses more words than necessary to convey the same message, which makes it less concise and less focused.  Therefore, Output (b) is better because it provides a more concise and focused summary of the article's main points, accurately representing the challenges and positive aspects of new motherhood during the pandemic.

I hope my evaluation has provided a well-considered alternative solution to the previous referees' argument.|||Scientist:  As a Scientist, I have carefully evaluated both outputs, and I agree with the previous referees' arguments. Output (a) provides a more comprehensive summary of the article's main points, accurately highlighting the themes of isolation, uncertainty, and pressure on mental health, while also mentioning the silver linings and positives that the mothers found in their shared experience. Additionally, it gives a clear overview of the project's purpose and the book's availability.  On the other hand, Output (b) focuses more on the emotional aspects of the mothers' experiences and their connections with each other, but it does not provide a clear summary of the article's main points.  Therefore, Output (a) is better because it provides a more balanced and comprehensive summary of the article, accurately representing the main themes and ideas presented in the text.  Output (a): "Born in Lockdown is a book written by 277 new mothers in the UK about their experiences of becoming a mother during the pandemic. The mothers share their feelings of isolation, uncertainty, and pressure on their mental health, but also highlight the silver linings and positives that have come out of this joint experience. The project was set up by Bristol novelist Emylia Hall to encourage writing for pleasure and purpose. The book is an unflinchingly honest and moving account of new motherhood during the pandemic, where resilience, love, and hope shine through. The book is available for free download from the Mothership Writers website, with voluntary donations going to the stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands."

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (a) is better.  My reasoning is as follows:  Output (a) provides a more comprehensive summary of the article's main points. It accurately highlights the key themes of the book, including the challenges faced by new mothers during the pandemic, the importance of self-expression, and the resilience and hope that shine through in the stories shared. Additionally, Output (a) includes relevant details about the project's initiator, Emylia Hall, and the charity that will receive voluntary donations, Sands.

The mention of Ed Miliband's promise of apprenticeships for every school leaver who "gets the grades" adds depth to the summary, demonstrating an understanding of the party's focus on education and skills.  On the other hand, Output (b) attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of all the political parties' stances on apprenticeships. While it succeeds in mentioning various parties' proposals, it lacks the clarity and focus of Output (a). The inclusion of UKIP's proposal for an apprenticeship option instead of four non-core GCSE subjects, for instance, seems out of place in a summary that primarily focuses on apprenticeships.  Furthermore, Output (b) contains some ambiguous phrasing, such as "The main political parties in the UK are all pushing for more apprenticeships to help young people find work and gain qualifications." This statement could be misinterpreted as implying that all parties are in agreement on this issue, which is not the case.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.

Therefore, Output (b) is better. It effectively highlights the key issues faced by the hospitality sector in a clear and concise manner, making it a more informative and helpful summary for readers.  However, I also acknowledge that Output (a) provides more detailed information, which may be useful for readers who want a more comprehensive understanding of the numbers mentioned in the article. In this case, both outputs have their strengths and weaknesses, and it is difficult to definitively say that one is better than the other.  Therefore, I suggest that both outputs be considered equally good, and that the final decision be based on other factors, such as the clarity and coherence of the writing, the use of appropriate language and tone, and the overall effectiveness of the summary in conveying the main points of the article.

While it mentions a few other celebrities, the summary is not as comprehensive as Output (a) and lacks the same level of detail and organization.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.  I agree with the previous referees' arguments that Output (a) is more comprehensive and well-structured. Output (b) could benefit from more depth and analysis of the reasons behind the success or failure of the celebrity brands mentioned, but it fails to provide a comprehensive summary of the article's main points.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.  However, I would like to note that both outputs have some areas for improvement. Output (a) could benefit from more specific examples and concrete data to support its claims. Output (b) could provide more depth and analysis of the reasons behind the success or failure of the celebrity brands mentioned.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (b) is better.  Output (b) provides a more concise and clear summary of the article's conclusion. It effectively conveys the main points of the story, including the fact that Lloyds Bank initially refused to refund the stolen money, Vodafone's involvement in the case, and Sue's desire for accountability.  On the other hand, Output (a) provides a more detailed explanation of the events leading up to the fraud case, but it lacks focus and clarity. The inclusion of unnecessary details and repetitive information makes it difficult to understand the main points of the story.  Therefore, Output (b) is better.|||Critic:  As a Critic, I have carefully evaluated both outputs and considered the previous referees' arguments. I agree with the previous referees that Output (b) provides a more concise and clear summary of the article's conclusion. However, I also notice that Output (a) provides additional details that help to understand the events leading up to the fraud case.  After re-reading the article and both outputs, I have come to the conclusion that Output (a) is better. The additional details provided in Output (a) help to paint a clearer picture of the events that took place and the parties involved. The inclusion of the fact that Sue, the daughter, contacted her local police force and Action Fraud, and the response she received from both, adds depth to the summary. It also highlights the lack of action taken by the authorities and the bank, which is an important aspect of the story.  Furthermore, Output (a) uses more precise language when describing the actions taken by the bank and the company. For example, it states that Lloyds "eventually agreed to refund the money stolen from Margaret's account, plus interest and compensation" whereas Output (b) simply states that Lloyds "agreed to refund all of Margaret's money, plus interest and £600 by way of compensation." The use of "eventually" in Output (a) implies that the bank did not initially refund the money and that there was a process involved in getting them to agree to do so.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.  However, I do agree with the previous referees that Output (b) is more concise and easier to read. It effectively summarizes the main points of the story in a clear and straightforward manner.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (a) is better.  My reasoning is as follows:  Output (a) provides a clearer and more concise summary of the article's conclusion. It effectively conveys the key information that Lloyds Bank has refunded the stolen money, plus interest and compensation, and that Vodafone is also reviewing the case. Additionally, Output (a) uses simpler language and is easier to understand for a general audience.  On the other hand, Output (b) provides more details about Sue's concerns and her desire for accountability, which are not directly related to the main conclusion of the article. While it is important to acknowledge Sue's feelings and concerns, Output (b) could benefit from a clearer focus on the main points of the article.

While both outputs provide a good summary of the article's conclusion, I believe that Output (b) is better.  Output (b) provides a more detailed and nuanced summary of the article's conclusion. It not only mentions the refund of the stolen money, but also highlights Sue's concerns about the lack of accountability and her desire for someone to be held responsible for the fraud. This additional context helps to provide a more complete understanding of the situation and the impact it had on Sue and her family.  Furthermore, Output (b) uses more active and engaging language, which makes it easier to read and understand.

In contrast, Output (a) feels more like a list of facts, rather than a cohesive summary. It lacks the context and detail provided in Output (b), and the language is more passive and dry.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (a) is better.  My reasoning is as follows:  Output (a) provides a clearer and more concise summary of MercadoLibre's founding story and initial growth. The first sentence immediately establishes the company's founder, Marcos Galperin, and his inspiration for creating the company. The following sentences logically flow from one another, providing a brief overview of the company's development, including its expansion across Latin America, annual revenues, and eBay's investment.  On the other hand, Output (b) takes a more roundabout approach to summarizing the story. The first sentence mentions MercadoLibre's similarity to eBay, but it takes several sentences before the reader learns that Marcos Galperin founded the company.

The first sentence is quite abrupt, immediately listing Marcos Galperin's name and his inspiration for creating the company without providing any context. The rest of the summary follows a similar pattern, listing facts and figures without much cohesion or flow.  Therefore, Output (b) is better.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (a) is better.  Output (a) provides a more comprehensive summary of the possible explanations for the Fermi Paradox, including the idea that the window of opportunity for similar technology is small, the waves scientists are looking for may not be the right ones, and the possibility that intelligent life destroys itself. Additionally, it mentions the Rare Earth hypothesis and the idea that humans may be living in a computer simulation created by beings with a superior intellect.  On the other hand, Output (b) focuses more on the Fermi Paradox and the Rare Earth hypothesis, but does not provide as much detail on the other possible explanations.  Therefore, Output (a) is better because it offers a more thorough and balanced summary of the possible explanations for the Fermi Paradox, making it a more informative and helpful output for the reader.|||Critic:  As a Critic, I have carefully evaluated both outputs and considered the previous referees' arguments. While Output (a) provides a more comprehensive summary of the possible explanations for the Fermi Paradox, Output (b) offers a more concise and focused summary of the main ideas.

Output (b) effectively summarizes the main points of the article, highlighting the Fermi Paradox and the Rare Earth hypothesis as the most significant explanations for the lack of evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth. The output also mentions the idea of self-destruction and the possibility of humans being in a computer simulation, but it does not get bogged down in unnecessary details.  In contrast, Output (a) tries to cover too many aspects of the article, resulting in a less focused summary. It devotes too much space to discussing the search for extraterrestrial life and the Drake equation, which are not the main focuses of the article. Additionally, the language used in Output (a) is sometimes unclear and hard to follow, which can make it difficult for readers to understand the author's intended meaning.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (b) is better.  Output (b) provides a clear and concise timeline of Ethiopia's political evolution, starting from 1991 when the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) became the leader of a four-party coalition that governed Ethiopia after ousting a military regime. It then highlights key events in 1994, 2018, 2019, and 2020, including the adoption of a federal system, Abiy Ahmed's appointment as Prime Minister, the signing of a peace treaty with Eritrea, and the current conflict in Tigray.  On the other hand, Output (a) focuses more on the recent conflict in Tigray and provides a summary of the events leading up to the current situation. While it does mention some key dates, such as 2018 and 2020, it does not provide a clear timeline like Output (b) does.

The second sentence further explains Jack's passion for photography and lifeboats, mentioning his love for the RNLI since he was 8 years old. The third sentence provides more details about the Victorian photographic process he uses and how he spends at least a day at each lifeboat station.  On the other hand, Output (b) provides more information about Jack's project and his plans for the future, but it lacks the clarity and focus of Output (a). The first sentence is quite general and doesn't provide much context, while the second sentence jumps into Jack's plans for the future without fully establishing his background. The third sentence provides some interesting details about Jack's conversion of an old ambulance into a darkroom, but it feels disconnected from the rest of the summary.  Therefore, Output (a) is better. It provides a more coherent and focused summary of Jack Lowe's background and passion for photography and lifeboats, making it easier for readers to understand the context and significance of his project.|||Critic:  As a Critic, I have carefully evaluated both outputs and considered the previous referees' arguments. While Output (a) provides a clear and concise summary of Jack Lowe's background and passion for photography and lifeboats, I believe that Output (b) offers a more comprehensive and engaging summary.  Output (b) not only provides a clear overview of Jack's background and passion but also gives a glimpse into his personal journey and future plans. The third sentence, which mentions Jack's conversion of an old ambulance into a darkroom, adds a unique touch to the summary and showcases his dedication to his craft.  Furthermore, Output (b) uses more varied and descriptive language, which makes the summary more engaging and enjoyable to read. For example, the phrase "lifeboat enthusiast" in the first sentence adds a sense of excitement and passion to the summary, while the phrase "Victorian photographic methods" in the second sentence provides a sense of nostalgia and historical significance.  Therefore, Output (b) is better. It offers a more comprehensive and engaging summary of Jack Lowe's background and passion for photography and lifeboats, making it a more enjoyable and informative read for the audience.|||Scientist:  As a Scientist, I have evaluated both outputs and considered the previous referees' arguments.

However, I must say that I do have some reservations about the wording and phrasing used in Output (a). For example, the phrase "the Puritans actually approved of drink" could be rephrased as "the Puritans were not opposed to drinking" or "the Puritans did not prohibit drinking." Additionally, the sentence "It notes that while alcohol consumption is now more regulated, it is still a part of American culture" could be rephrased as "Alcohol consumption is now more regulated, but it remains an integral part of American culture."  Nevertheless, I believe that Output (a) is still the better summary overall, and I stand by my decision.|||Scientist:  As a Scientist, I have carefully evaluated both outputs, and I must say that I agree with the previous referees' decision that Output (a) is better.

One area where Output (a) excels is in its ability to provide a clear and concise narrative of the history of alcohol consumption in America. The author uses a chronological structure to walk the reader through the different eras of alcohol consumption, from the early days of the Puritans to the Prohibition era and beyond. This approach makes it easier for the reader to understand the complex historical context surrounding alcohol consumption in America.  In contrast, Output (b) takes a more statistical approach, focusing on the quantities consumed per person per year. While this approach has its merits, it does not provide the same level of context and narrative as Output (a). The author does mention the peak in consumption in 1830 and the impact of Prohibition, but these points are not developed in as much detail as they are in Output (a).  Furthermore, Output (a) provides a more nuanced understanding of the cultural significance of alcohol in American society. The author notes that while alcohol consumption has decreased over the years, it remains an integral part of American culture, as evidenced by the fact that many presidents have been seen drinking socially and making toasts with international dignitaries. This insight adds depth to the summary and highlights the complex relationship between alcohol consumption and American culture.  In conclusion, Output (a) is the better summary.|||General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (a) is better.

My reasoning is as follows:  Output (a) provides a clearer and more concise summary of the changes in American alcohol consumption. It accurately states that the average consumption of pure alcohol per year was 5.8 gallons in 1790, 7.1 gallons in 1830, and 2.3 gallons in 2019. It also mentions the impact of Prohibition on alcohol consumption and how it led to the rise of speakeasies and organized crime.  On the other hand, Output (b) provides a more detailed history of alcohol consumption in America, including the Puritans' approval of drinking and the integration of alcohol into daily life. However, it lacks the clarity and conciseness of Output (a) and does not provide a clear summary of the changes in alcohol consumption.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.|||Critic:  As a Critic, I have carefully evaluated both outputs, and I must say that I agree with the previous referee's decision that Output (a) is better.  Output (a) provides a clear and concise summary of the changes in American alcohol consumption. It effectively highlights the significant changes in consumption over time, from 5.8 gallons per year in 1790 to 2.3 gallons per year in 2019. The summary also mentions the impact of Prohibition on alcohol consumption and how it led to the rise of speakeasies and organized crime.  On the other hand, Output (b) provides a more detailed history of alcohol consumption in America, which is useful but not directly relevant to the given requirement. The summary lacks the clarity and conciseness of Output (a) and does not provide a clear summary of the changes in alcohol consumption.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.  However, I must say that the decision was not an easy one, as both outputs have their strengths and weaknesses. Output (b) provides valuable information on the history of alcohol consumption in America, which could be useful in a different context. Nevertheless, based on the given requirement, Output (a) better meets the criteria of summarizing the changes in American alcohol consumption.  In conclusion, I agree with the previous referee's decision that Output (a) is better, but I also recognize the value of Output (b) in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the history of alcohol consumption in America.|||Scientist:  As a Scientist, I have carefully evaluated both outputs, and I agree with the previous referees that Output (a) is better.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (a) is better.  Output (a) provides a more detailed and nuanced explanation of the option of building on green belt lands as a solution to London's housing crisis. It highlights the argument put forth by Sam Bowman, a research director at pro free market think-tank The Adam Smith Institute, that building on green belt land would mean "bigger homes and cheaper homes for everybody in order to give people that space to live". It also acknowledges the counterargument by Ann Goddard of Elstree & Borehamwood Greenbelt Society, that green belt is important for recreation purposes and to make a demarcation between settlements.

Output (a) provides a more detailed and nuanced explanation of the option of building on green belt lands as a solution to London's housing crisis. It highlights the argument put forth by Sam Bowman, a research director at pro free market think-tank The Adam Smith Institute, that building on green belt land would mean "bigger homes and cheaper homes for everybody in order to give people that space to live". It also acknowledges the counterargument by Ann Goddard of Elstree & Borehamwood Greenbelt Society, that green belt is important for recreation purposes and to make a demarcation between settlements. Furthermore, Output (a) suggests a compromise could be reached "if we stopped thinking of the greenbelt as one single unit and differentiate between the areas of beauty and the intensive farmland".  On the other hand, Output (b) provides a more general and concise explanation of the solution to build more homes on green belt land. It does not delve into the details of the argument and counterargument, nor does it offer a compromise solution.  Therefore, Output (a) is better because it provides a more comprehensive and balanced explanation of the option of building on green belt lands as a solution to London's housing crisis. It acknowledges both the potential benefits and drawbacks of the solution, and offers a way forward through differentiation between areas of beauty and intensive farmland.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (a) is better.  The reason for my decision is that Output (a) provides a more concise and clear summary of the article's main point, which is the impact of the halted production of the 737 Max on its suppliers. The output directly states that the suspension of production is likely to have a significant impact on the suppliers, with some of them being highly dependent on the jet. It also mentions that Boeing has said it will not lay off workers associated with the 737 Max, but the stoppage is likely to affect suppliers and the wider economy.  On the other hand, Output (b) provides a similar summary, but it includes additional information that is not directly related to the suppliers. For example, it mentions the reason for the halted production, which is the need for Boeing to redesign the automated control system, and the fact that the company will not lay off workers associated with the 737 Max. While this information is relevant to the article, it dilutes the main point of the summary, which is the impact on the suppliers.  Therefore, Output (a) is better because it provides a more focused and concise summary of the article's main point.|||Critic:  As a Critic, I have carefully evaluated both outputs and considered the previous referees' arguments.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (a) is better.  My reasoning is as follows:  Output (a) provides a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of the implications of the halted production of the 737 Max on its suppliers. It highlights the potential consequences for smaller firms, such as loss of revenue and layoffs, and mentions that some suppliers, like Spirit AeroSystems, are highly dependent on the jet. It also mentions that Boeing may compensate suppliers for the suspension.  On the other hand, Output (b) provides a more general overview of the situation, stating that the halted production has had serious implications for suppliers and that many of them are highly dependent on the jet. It does not provide as much detail as Output (a) regarding the potential consequences for smaller firms or the possible compensation from Boeing.

The production freeze is expected to affect over 600 companies in the global supply chain. Smaller firms, in particular, could face serious consequences, such as loss of revenue and potential layoffs. Some suppliers, like Spirit AeroSystems, are highly dependent on the jet, with half of their revenue attached to it. Boeing has said it will not lay off workers associated with the 737 Max, but the stoppage is likely to affect suppliers and the wider economy. The situation surrounding the 737 Max is extraordinary, with nine months having passed since the aircraft was grounded worldwide, and it is still not clear when it will be certified to fly again. Regulators are playing hardball, and for Boeing, being forced to shut down the production line is deeply embarrassing and likely to prove costly.

Additionally, it provides context on the number of visas granted to Haitian families and the disparity in treatment between Haitians and other nationalities. This information helps to paint a clearer picture of the situation and better understand the concerns of the locals.  On the other hand, Output (a) focuses solely on the overcrowding of shelters and the impact on medical facilities, which, while important, does not provide a complete picture of the situation. It also fails to mention the fear and uncertainty among the locals, which is an essential aspect of the summary requirement.  Therefore, Output (b) is better.|||Critic:  As a Critic, I have carefully evaluated both outputs and considered the previous referees' arguments.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating the two outputs, I believe that Output (a) is better. The reason for this is that Output (a) provides a more comprehensive explanation for Bardon's stance against abortion.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (a) is better.  Output (a) provides a more comprehensive summary of the protest against primary tests in England. It covers the main arguments of the campaign, including the concern about over-testing and the impact of primary tests on children's happiness and joy of learning. It also mentions the petition signed by over 40,000 parents and the social media campaign urging parents to take their children on educational activities for the day.  On the other hand, Output (b) focuses more on the action taken by parents in keeping their children out of school to protest against primary tests. While it mentions the concerns about over-testing, it does not provide as much detail as Output (a) about the campaign's arguments and the impact of primary tests.

While it does provide more context about the campaign's arguments and the impact of primary tests, it dilutes the main message of the summary.  Therefore, Output (b) is better because it effectively conveys the main idea of the protest against primary tests in a clear and concise manner.|||Scientist:  As a Scientist, I have evaluated both outputs, and I believe that Output (a) is better.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (a) is better.  The reason for my decision is that Output (a) provides a more comprehensive and detailed summary of the measures retailer companies have taken to cope with Brexit. It specifically mentions the names of the companies that have stopped delivering to the UK, such as Dutch Bike Bits and Beer On Web, and also notes that others, such as Scandinavian Outdoor, have temporarily closed their store to UK-based customers. Additionally, it mentions the imposition of additional charges by international shipping companies, including Federal Express and TNT, to reflect the increased investment they have had to make in adjusting their systems to cope with Brexit.  On the other hand, Output (b) provides a more general summary of the situation, mentioning that some EU specialist online retailers have stopped delivering to the UK and that international shipping companies have imposed additional charges on shipments between the UK and the EU. While it mentions the names of some of the companies that have taken these measures, it does not provide the same level of detail as Output (a) regarding the specific actions taken by each company.  Therefore, Output (a) is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed summary of the measures retailer companies have taken to cope with Brexit, making it a more informative and useful output for the given instruction.|||Critic:  As a Critic, I have carefully evaluated both outputs and considered the previous referees' arguments.

My reasoning is as follows:  Output (a) provides a clear and concise summary of the people who gave their definitions of collusion in the article. It lists the individuals who provided definitions, including Sir John Stevens, Peter Cory, Nuala O'Loan, Al Hutchinson, and Peter Smithwick, and briefly describes their definitions. This output is helpful for readers who want to quickly understand the different definitions of collusion provided by various individuals in the article.  On the other hand, Output (b) provides a more detailed analysis of the definitions of collusion given by the individuals mentioned in the article. It highlights the differences in the definitions provided by Stevens, Cory, O'Loan, Hutchinson, and Smithwick, and discusses how they relate to each other. While this output is informative, it is less concise and less helpful for readers who are only looking for a quick summary of the people who gave their definitions of collusion.  Therefore, Output (a) is better because it provides a clear and concise summary of the people who gave their definitions of collusion in the article, making it more helpful for readers who want a quick understanding of the different definitions provided.|||Critic:  As a Critic, I have carefully evaluated both outputs, and I agree with the previous referee that Output (a) is better.

However, I would like to note that both outputs have done an excellent job in summarizing the article and providing relevant information to the reader. The difference between the two outputs is that Output (a) is more concise and focused on providing a quick summary, while Output (b) is more detailed and provides a deeper analysis of the definitions of collusion.  In conclusion, Therefore, Output (a) is better, but both outputs have done an excellent job in summarizing the article and providing relevant information to the reader.|||Scientist:  As a Scientist, I have carefully evaluated both outputs, and I agree with the previous referees that Output (a) is better.

General Public:  After carefully evaluating both outputs, I have decided that Output (a) is better.  The reason for my decision is that Output (a) provides a clearer and more concise timeline of events related to Ford's history in Bridgend. The output starts by mentioning Ford's decision to choose Bridgend for its new engine plant in 1977 and then goes on to highlight the key events and milestones in the plant's history, including the opening of the plant in 1980, the switch to producing engines for Jaguar, and the recent announcement of a reduced engine production.  On the other hand, Output (b) provides a more general overview of the challenges faced by the Bridgend engine plant, including the impact of Ford's globalization strategy, the decline of the UK car industry, and the pressure to be efficient in the face of Brexit. While this output does provide some useful information, it lacks the specific details and timeline provided in Output (a).  Therefore, Output (a) is better.|||Critic:  As a Critic, I have carefully evaluated both outputs and considered the previous referees' arguments. I agree with the previous referees that Output (a) provides a clearer and more concise timeline of events related to Ford's history in Bridgend.

While Output (a) provides a clear and concise summary of the new curriculum for Wales, I believe that Output (b) offers a more detailed and comprehensive explanation of the curriculum's key points.  Output (b) provides a better organization of the information by breaking it down into two sections: one for children currently in year three or below, and another for secondary school children. This makes it easier for readers to quickly find the information that is relevant to them. Additionally, Output (b) provides more specific examples of how the new curriculum will be implemented in schools, such as the "zombie apocalypse" project, which helps readers better understand the practical applications of the curriculum.  Furthermore, Output (b) addresses potential concerns about the new curriculum, such as the incorporation of subjects into six "areas of learning and experience" for secondary school children, and the questions about how exams at 16 will work in the context of the broader sort of education the new curriculum is meant to introduce.
