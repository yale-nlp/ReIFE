Response B: - The summary accurately lists all the anti-air pollution measures taken by the government during the winter as mentioned in the article. - The summary clearly conveys the residents' opinions of the government's anti-air pollution measures, as it mentions their dissatisfaction with the measures and their call for more drastic action. - The anti-air pollution measures and residents' opinions are presented in a balanced manner. - The summary avoids including information that is not directly related to the government's anti-air pollution measures or residents' opinions of them. - The summary is concise while still covering all necessary points from the article. - The summary maintains the original context and meaning of the article without introducing any inaccuracies. - The language of the summary is clear and easy to understand. - The summary avoids any subjective interpretation or bias, but it does not present the anti-air pollution measures in a completely balanced manner, as it emphasizes the residents' call for more drastic action.  Reason of A=B: Both responses accurately list all the anti-air pollution measures taken by the government during the winter as mentioned in the article.  Reason of A>B: Response A does not clearly convey the residents' opinions of the government's anti-air pollution measures, which is an important aspect of the summary requirement.  Reason of B>A: Response B clearly conveys the residents' opinions of the government's anti-air pollution measures, which is an important aspect of the summary requirement. However, it does not present the anti-air pollution measures in a completely balanced manner.  Choice: Response B, as it more accurately summarizes the residents' opinions of the government's anti-air pollution measures, which is a crucial aspect of the summary requirement.
