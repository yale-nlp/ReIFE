General Public: Output (b) generates an array of random numbers from 1 to 100, which is the instruction's requirement. However, there is a mistake in the code where the `random.randint(1, 101)` function will generate numbers from 1 to 100, but the condition `while len(array) != n` will cause an infinite loop because the length of the array will never be equal to `n` if `n` is not initially set to 0.
