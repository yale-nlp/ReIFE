General Public: Therefore, Output (b) is better.    The passage describes a patient's inability to recognize written words as a potential symptom of a neuropsychological syndrome. The symptoms of LPPA, such as slow speech, difficulty finding words, and impaired memory, closely match the symptoms of the patient's inability to recognize written words. Therefore, LPPA is a more likely diagnosis than the other option, which is a lack of motivation or interest.|||Scientist: Therefore, Output (b) is better.
