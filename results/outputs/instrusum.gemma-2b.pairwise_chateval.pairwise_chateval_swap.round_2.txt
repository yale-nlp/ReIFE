They saw it as a good creature of God and allowed its consumption in moderation. However, by the early 1800s, alcoholism was becoming a serious problem in America. In response, the temperance movement emerged, leading to Prohibition in 1917. Prohibition did not ban alcohol consumption, but led to the rise of organized crime and speakeasies. The cost of enforcement eventually became prohibitive, and in 1933, Prohibition was ended. Since then, America has had a mishmash of local, state, and federal controls on alcohol.|||Scientist: **Therefore, Output (a) is better.**    The article clearly shows that the Puritans were not as opposed to alcohol as many people believe.

General Public: Therefore, Output (a) is better.    The decline of the Bridgend engine plant is part of a larger shift that has been taking place since the early 1990s. In 2008, Ford decided to operate as a global company, which meant standardizing models across the world and investing in the most efficient plants. This put pressure on the Bridgend plant, which had to compete with other Ford engine plants globally. When Ford stopped assembling cars in the UK, this made the landscape even more challenging for Bridgend. Now, engines made in Bridgend are shipped all over the world to be put into cars before being sent back to showrooms in the UK. With Brexit on the horizon, factories making engines in the UK will have to be even more efficient to stay open. Therefore, Output (a) is better because it provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the situation.|||Scientist: **Explanation:**    The decline of the Bridgend engine plant is part of a larger shift that has been taking place since the early 1990s.

General Public: **Therefore, Output (a) is better.**    The article emphasizes the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the extraction of valuable metals from the ocean floor. The assessment of the eastern Pacific's Clarion-Clipperton Zone estimates that over 27 billion tonnes of mineral-rich nodules could be present, containing seven billion tonnes of manganese, 340 million tonnes of nickel, 290 million tonnes of copper, and 78 million tonnes of cobalt. This suggests that deep sea mining could be a significant source of valuable metals for the world.|||Scientist: **Explanation:** Output (a) is better because it provides a more comprehensive analysis of the potential benefits and drawbacks of deep sea mining.
