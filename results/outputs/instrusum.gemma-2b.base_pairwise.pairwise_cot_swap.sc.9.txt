These metals are essential for many industries, and deep sea mining could provide a new source of them.    **Decision:** Therefore, Output (a) is better.
**Explanation:** Output (a) is better because it provides more details about the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the specific metals that can be extracted and the vast amount of resources that could be exploited. Output (b) focuses more on the environmental impact of deep sea mining and the challenges that would need to be overcome before it could be a viable commercial venture.    **Therefore, Output (a) is better.**
**Explanation:** Output (a) is better because it provides more details about the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the specific metals that can be extracted and the potential environmental impact. Output (b) focuses more on the potential environmental impact of deep sea mining.    **Therefore, Output (a) is better.**
**Explanation:** Output (a) is better because it provides a more detailed and comprehensive analysis of the potential benefits and environmental impact of deep sea mining. Output (b) focuses primarily on the potential economic benefits of the industry, which is less relevant to the question.    **Therefore, Output (a) is better.**
**Explanation:** Output (a) is better because it provides more detailed information about the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the specific metals that can be extracted and the estimated quantities of these metals. This information is more helpful for making a decision about which output is better.    **Therefore, Output (a) is better.**
