Therefore, Answer (b) is better.  Based on the information provided in the article, the charity institutes mentioned are the Women's Equality Party and the Fawcett Society. Both of these organizations are advocating for policies that promote gender equality in the workplace, such as providing state childcare help, advertising jobs as flexible or part-time, paying the living wage, and supporting women to progress to higher paid jobs.  The Women's Equality Party is specifically calling for a "daddy quota" of 90 days' leave to be allocated solely to the father, with the caveat that if the father doesn't take the time off work, the couple as a whole lose the three months' paid leave. This policy aims to ensure that fathers take on a more active role in caring for their children, which can help to level the playing field between men and women in the workplace.  The Fawcett Society, on the other hand, is advocating for employers to advertise jobs at all levels as flexible, part-time, or a job share unless there is a strong business case not to. This policy recognizes that work-life balance is important for both men and women, and that flexible work arrangements can help to reduce the gender pay gap by allowing women to continue working while also caring for their families.  Overall, both charity institutes are advocating for policies that promote gender equality in the workplace and support women's empowerment. Therefore, Answer (b) is better.

Secondly, Breakr's ability to allow users to join chatrooms anonymously is unique and could potentially provide a more secure and private platform for users.  Lastly, while both apps have raised significant funding and have been met with enthusiasm, there are also concerns about the potential for users to be identified and legal issues to arise. Therefore, Answer (b) is better as it provides a more comprehensive and secure platform for users who want to maintain their anonymity online.

Therefore, Answer (a) is better.  Based on the information provided in the article, both Whisper and Secret offer apps that allow users to post anonymous statements. However, Whisper has raised more funds ($60m) and has a more comprehensive approach to anonymity, allowing users to download the app and post anonymous statements without revealing their identities. In contrast, Secret accesses users' phone contacts to show Secrets from friends or friends of friends, which may raise privacy concerns.  While both apps have their unique features, Whisper's approach to anonymity seems more robust and better suited to the current internet landscape. The article highlights the importance of anonymity in light of the Edward Snowden revelations and the intrusion of social networks into our real lives. By allowing users to download the app and post anonymous statements without revealing their identities, Whisper seems to be better positioned to provide a truly anonymous platform for users.  On the other hand, Secret's approach to anonymity relies on accessing users' phone contacts, which may raise privacy concerns.

Therefore, Answer (a) is better.  In this article, several individuals provided their definitions of collusion, and I evaluated each definition based on the given requirement. Sir John Stevens, Peter Cory, Nuala O'Loan, Al Hutchinson, and Peter Smithwick are the people who gave their definitions of collusion in the article. Each definition provided by these individuals is comprehensive and covers various aspects of collusion.  Sir John Stevens' definition of collusion is broad and covers a wide range of actions, including the wilful failure to keep records, the absence of accountability, the withholding of intelligence and evidence, and the extreme of agents being involved in murder. This definition is inclusive and captures the essence of collusion.  Peter Cory's definition of collusion is also comprehensive and highlights the importance of having a secret understanding. He emphasizes that connivance is a synonym of the verb collude and includes definitions such as "to deliberately ignore" and "to turn a blind eye." This definition is detailed and provides a clear understanding of the term collusion.  Nuala O'Loan adopted the definitions of Lord Stevens and Peter Cory, concluding that there had been collusion in the murder of Raymond McCord jnr. Her definition is similar to that of Stevens and Cory, and she emphasizes the importance of accountability and the withholding of intelligence and evidence.  Al Hutchinson applied a less broad definition of collusion in his report on the attack on McGurk's Bar. He emphasizes that the essence of collusion requires that a number of elements be present, including an agreement between two or more parties and evidence that the act or omission complained of was deliberate. This definition is more specific and focuses on the intentional actions of individuals or organizations.  Peter Smithwick gave a similar definition of collusion to that of Peter Cory, stating that it generally means the commission of an act but can also involve an omission or failure to act. This definition is inclusive and covers both active and passive forms of collusion.  After evaluating each definition provided by these individuals, I conclude that Sir John Stevens' definition is the most comprehensive and inclusive. It covers a wide range of actions and emphasizes the importance of accountability and the withholding of intelligence and evidence. Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
Therefore, Answer (a) is better.  In this article, several individuals provided their definitions of collusion, and I evaluated each definition based on the given requirement. The definitions provided by Sir John Stevens, Peter Cory, Nuala O'Loan, Al Hutchinson, and Peter Smithwick all cover the key aspects of collusion, including agreement, intent, and concealment. However, upon closer analysis, I found that Stevens' and Cory's definitions are more comprehensive and better capture the essence of collusion.  Stevens' definition encompasses a wide range of actions and omissions, from the wilful failure to keep records to the extreme of agents being involved in murder. This broad definition allows for a more nuanced understanding of collusion, recognizing that it can take many forms and can be perpetrated through various means. Cory's definition, on the other hand, highlights the importance of secrecy and understanding in collusion, emphasizing that it involves an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose.  In contrast, the definitions provided by O'Loan, Hutchinson, and Smithwick are less comprehensive and focus more on specific aspects of collusion, such as the requirement of deliberate ignorance or inaction. While these definitions are useful in certain contexts, they do not fully capture the complexity and scope of collusion as defined by Stevens and Cory.  In conclusion, based on the given requirement and the definitions provided by the individuals in the article, I find that Answer (a) is better, as it provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of collusion.
Therefore, Answer (b) is better.  The definitions of collusion provided in the article all share a common thread: they emphasize the importance of an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations, usually with the intention of achieving an unlawful or improper purpose. While some definitions, such as those provided by Lord Stevens and Peter Cory, use more broad terms like "co-ordination, dissemination and sharing of intelligence" and "connive," others, like the definition provided by Al Hutchinson, are more specific and focus on the deliberate ignoring or turning a blind eye to a known wrongdoing or misbehavior.  Overall, the definitions provided in the article all suggest that collusion involves some form of agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations, and that this agreement can take many forms, including positive actions or deliberate omissions. However, the definitions also highlight the importance of considering the context and intentions behind any actions or omissions when determining whether collusion has occurred.  In conclusion, Answer (b) provides a more comprehensive and nuanced definition of collusion that takes into account the various forms that collusion can take, as well as the importance of considering the context and intentions behind any actions or omissions. Therefore, Answer (b) is better.
Therefore, Answer (a) is better.  In my evaluation, I found that Answer (a) provides a more comprehensive and inclusive definition of collusion. It covers a wide range of actions and omissions, including agreements, arrangements, and actions intended to achieve unlawful or improper purposes, as well as deliberately ignoring or turning a blind eye to known wrongdoing. This definition is consistent with the dictionary definitions provided in the article, and it takes into account the various ways in which collusion can manifest, including through the withholding of intelligence and evidence, and the failure to keep records or take action against known wrongdoing.  In contrast, Answer (b) is more focused on the idea of an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose. While this definition is also broad and inclusive, it does not fully capture the complexity of collusion and the various ways in which it can be perpetuated.  Overall, I believe that Answer (a) provides a more comprehensive and accurate definition of collusion, and therefore it is the better choice.
Therefore, Answer (a) is better.  Based on the definitions provided in the article, it is clear that there are several similarities among them. However, I find that Answer (a) provides the most comprehensive and inclusive definition of collusion. It covers both active acts and omissions or failures to act, and includes the deliberate ignoring or turning a blind eye to wrongful acts. This definition is broad enough to encompass various forms of collusion, including connivance, conspiracy, and collaboration.  In contrast, Answer (b) is more focused on the presence of secret agreements or arrangements between individuals or organizations to achieve unlawful or improper purposes. While this definition is certainly relevant to the topic of collusion, it does not fully capture the scope of the concept as described in the article.  Overall, I believe that Answer (a) provides a more comprehensive and accurate definition of collusion, and therefore it is the better choice.
