In 1978, he was taken to Tuol Sleng prison, where he was tortured for 12 days and nights to confess to spying for the US and Russia. He was whipped, had his fingers and toenails pulled out, and was subjected to electric shocks. He eventually confessed to anything to end the torture. He was allowed to live because he was of use to the regime, fixing sewing machines in the prison workshop. On January 7, 1979, Vietnamese troops captured Phnom Penh from the Khmer Rouge, and the prison staff fled. Chum Mey was marched at gunpoint by prison guards into the provinces, where he had a chance meeting with his wife and held his fourth child for the first time.
