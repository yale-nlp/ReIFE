low-cost smartphones giving farmers access to financial services they never had before. However, other tools such as access to credit, savings, investments, and income-smoothing mechanisms require data that is currently too expensive for the plans that farmers have. Better infrastructure and free internet are needed for farmers to benefit fully from new technology.  # Output (a): In the article, there are several statistics related to farming in Africa. According to the article, in Ghana, only 10% of smallholder farmers have documentation proving their ownership rights. In sub-Saharan Africa, nearly two-thirds of the rural population live on less than $1.25 a day. The article also mentions that low-cost smartphones have given farmers access to financial services they never had before, but other tools such as access to credit, savings, investments, and income-smoothing mechanisms require data that is currently too expensive for the plans that farmers have.
In the meantime, improving farmers' access to financial services - and financial security - also needs to be a priority for technical innovation, according to Ross Baird, chief executive of investment and business training organisation, Village Capital. Low-cost smartphones have given farmers access to financial services they never had before, but other tools, such as access to credit, savings, investments, and income-smoothing mechanisms require data that is currently too expensive for the plans that farmers have. Village Capital recently ran a business accelerator in East Africa focusing on these challenges. Africa needs better infrastructure, and preferably free internet, if farmers are to benefit fully from new technology. Ultimately, the goal is to see the average farmer earn a living wage and have financial security.
Differences Identification: 1. Chum Mey was taken to Tuol Sleng prison in 1978, where he was tortured and forced to confess to spying for the US and Russia. 2. He was subjected to electric shocks several times with a wire from a 220-volt wall socket. 3. He was allowed to live because he was of use to the regime, fixing sewing machines in the prison workshop. 4. He was marched at gunpoint by prison guards into the provinces, where he had a chance meeting with his wife, and held for the first time his fourth child - a boy, just two months old. 5. His wife and baby were shot dead in a paddy field.  Explanation and Rationale: Chum Mey's experiences at Tuol Sleng prison are a stark reminder of the brutality and inhumanity of the Khmer Rouge regime. His forced confession and torture are a clear violation of his human rights, and the use of electric shocks as a form of torture is particularly heinous. The fact that he was allowed to live because he was useful to the regime is a testament to the depravity of the Khmer Rouge, who showed no regard for human life or dignity. The final tragedy of his story, in which his wife and baby were shot dead, is a heartbreaking reminder of the devastating consequences of the Khmer Rouge's reign of terror.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.

He was subjected to electric shocks several times with a wire from a 220-volt wall socket. 3. He was allowed to live because he was of use to the regime, fixing sewing machines in the prison workshop. 4. He was marched at gunpoint by prison guards into the provinces, where he had a chance meeting with his wife, and held for the first time his fourth child - a boy, just two months old. 5. His wife and baby were shot dead in a paddy field.  Explanation and Rationale: Chum Mey's experiences at Tuol Sleng prison are a stark reminder of the brutality and inhumanity of the Khmer Rouge regime. His forced confession and torture are a clear violation of his human rights, and the use of electric shocks as a form of torture is particularly heinous. The fact that he was allowed to live because he was useful to the regime is a testament to the depravity of the Khmer Rouge, who showed no regard for human life or dignity. The final tragedy of his story, in which his wife and baby were shot dead, is a heartbreaking reminder of the devastating consequences of the Khmer Rouge's reign of terror.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.

Output (a) uses the phrase "in London" twice, while Output (b) uses it only once. 2. Output (a) mentions "Theatre" as the name of the street in Shoreditch, while Output (b) uses "Shoreditch" instead. 3. Output (a) refers to "The Theatre" as the first purpose-built home for drama in Britain, while Output (b) calls it "the first purpose-built theatre in London". 4.

Output (a) includes a sentence about the car park located on the site where Shakespeare lived in Silver Street, while Output (b) does not mention it.  Explanation and Rationale: Both Output (a) and Output (b) provide accurate information about the Shakespearean sites in London. However, there are some differences in the way the information is presented. Output (a) uses more specific language and details, such as "the first purpose-built home for drama in Britain" and "the site where Shakespeare lived in Silver Street".

On the other hand, Output (b) is more concise and straightforward, using simpler language and focusing on the main points of the article.  In terms of relevance, both outputs are equally relevant to the instruction, as they both provide information about Shakespearean sites in London.

Marston's, which has 1,700 pubs across the country, employs 14,000 people and has called for pubs to be given more time before they are required to pay business rates again. Stephen Welton, executive chairman of the Business Growth Fund, said that taking on more debt is not sustainable and that past recessions have shown that it's coming out of a recession - when companies are short of working capital - that they fall over.

of an individual who may have used Margaret's account to the police. Lloyds apologized for the distress and inconvenience caused by their handling of the case.  # Output (a): Differences Identification: 1. The article mentions that Lloyds initially concluded that the direct debits were "legitimately" set up, but after being contacted by BBC Money Box, they started a new investigation and concluded that their initial response was wrong. 2. The article highlights the lack of transparency in the current direct debit system and how it can be exploited by fraudsters.  Explanation and Rationale: Lloyds' initial response was incorrect, and they should have investigated further when Sue contacted them in 2017. The fact that Vodafone was able to set up direct debits in Margaret's name despite her dementia and lack of capacity to manage her own finances is a clear failure of the current system. The lack of transparency and accountability in the direct debit system makes it vulnerable to abuse, particularly in cases where the victim is elderly or vulnerable.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (b) is better. Lloyds' decision to refund the money and take action against the fraudster is a positive step towards addressing the issues with the direct debit system.

adoLibre is Latin America's version of eBay, with 109.6 million registered users and annual revenues of $473m. MercadoLibre operates in 12 countries across the region, from Mexico in the north, down to the bottom tip of Chile in the south.

ive either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response): Therefore, Output (a) is better. Jack Lowe's use of a 110-year-old camera and the Victorian photographic method of ambrotype creates a unique and timeless quality to the images he captures of RNLI volunteers. The process of coating the glass plate with chemicals and exposing it to light through the camera adds an element of history and tradition to the photographs, which is reflected in the subjects' willing participation. The longer exposure times also create a sense of peace and stillness in the images, which is in contrast to the fast-paced nature of modern photography.

However, as time progressed, alcohol consumption increased, and by 1790, Americans consumed an average of 5.8 gallons of pure alcohol per year. This period also saw the rise of temperance and eventual Prohibition movements, which led to a moral issue and the abolition of the traditional half-pint daily rum ration for sailors. After Prohibition ended in 1933, alcohol consumption decreased, and by the 1950s, Americans consumed an average of 2.3 gallons of pure alcohol per year. The exhibition highlights the changes in alcohol consumption and the impact of Prohibition on the country.  Please provide your evaluation and decision.

Secret's founders believe that their app is not solely focused on whistle-blowing, but rather on creating a platform for people to share their thoughts and feelings in a more authentic way. They argue that social media platforms like Facebook have trained users to curate their identities, and that Secret can help train users in empathy by allowing them to share more personal and vulnerable content. However, they also acknowledge that the app could be used for less noble purposes, such as gossip or leaking corporate secrets. Ultimately, the founders see their app as a way to create a more open and honest online community, but they also recognize the potential risks and challenges associated with creating such a platform.

solution to London's housing crisis is to build more properties on green belt lands. However, this option is controversial as it could lead to the destruction of green spaces and natural habitats. While building on green belt lands could provide more housing options, it is important to consider the potential environmental impacts and the need to protect these areas for future generations. Additionally, there may be alternative solutions that could address the housing crisis without compromising the green belt, such as increasing the supply of affordable housing or implementing policies to encourage the development of brownfield sites. Ultimately, any decision to build on green belt lands should be carefully considered and weighed against the potential benefits and drawbacks.

Additionally, there may be alternative solutions that could address the housing crisis without compromising the green belt, such as increasing the supply of affordable housing or implementing policies to encourage the development of brownfield sites. Ultimately, any decision to build on green belt lands should be carefully considered and weighed against the potential benefits and drawbacks.
strict measures to ensure safe tourism, including face masks, hydro-alcoholic gel, and temperature checks. While flights to the islands are expected to reach 30-40% of normal levels, the atmosphere is expected to be more sedate due to the absence of nightlife and the ban on nocturnal excesses. The industry is undergoing a transformation towards quality and five-star hotels, and the government is considering the use of technology to control numbers and improve hygiene. However, the dependence on tourism remains a concern, as it is a vulnerable sector that is susceptible to instability and has led to an over-dependence on low-paid and seasonal employment. The article highlights the need for alternative sources of income and a more sustainable approach to tourism.
tourists to the islands will help accelerate the shift towards more sustainable and responsible tourism practices. However, some environmentalists and locals are critical of the over-dependence on tourism and the negative impact it has on the environment and local communities. The article highlights the need for a more balanced economy and the development of alternative industries to reduce the islands' reliance on tourism. Additionally, the article notes that the current crisis may lead to a shift away from mass tourism and towards more niche and experiential tourism.

which came into force on 1 January. These retailers include Dutch Bike Bits, which has stated that it will no longer ship to every country in the world except the UK. Other firms have also taken similar measures, including Scandinavian Outdoor, which has temporarily closed its store from UK-based customers until its UK VAT registration and the overall process of selling to the UK post-Brexit has been sorted out. International shipping companies such as Federal Express and TNT have also imposed additional charges on shipments between the UK and the EU to reflect the increased investment they have had to make in adjusting their systems to cope with Brexit.
They said this reflected the increased investment they had had to make in adjusting their systems to cope with Brexit. The moves follow changes in VAT rules brought in by HM Revenue and Customs on 1 January. VAT is now being collected at the point of sale rather than at the point of importation. This essentially means that overseas retailers sending goods to the UK are expected to register for UK VAT and account for it to HMRC if the sale value is less than €150 (£135). A government spokesperson said: "The new VAT model ensures goods from EU and non-EU countries are treated in the same way and that UK businesses are not disadvantaged by competition from VAT-free imports. "The new system also addresses the problem of overseas sellers failing to pay the right amount of VAT on sales of goods already in the UK at the point of sale, raising an anticipated £300m every year. "Many EU businesses which currently sell goods to UK customers will have already registered for UK VAT under existing rules and HMRC is working very closely with those who haven't to ensure they can comply with the changes." Tackling evasion Adam French, Which? consumer rights expert, said consumers would be "frustrated" if the new VAT rules were applied in a way that causes significant inconvenience. "It's vital the government makes it clear to consumers as well as traders what the changes as a result of Brexit mean for them and how they shop. It should also work to ensure UK consumers can retain access to a wide range of competitively priced and quality goods." Campaigner Richard Allen, founder of Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, told the BBC that the massive increase in international online shopping had led to VAT evasion on a huge scale. He said the new HMRC rules were aimed at tackling that, but it was unclear how firms who failed to register for UK VAT would be dealt with. "Why should a phonograph spares manufacturer in Idaho bother to register for VAT in the UK and how are you going to make them do it?" he said. "And if they send the package anyway, what are you going to do?" 'Not what we wanted' "For providing this service, [HMRC] intend to charge a fee to every company in the world in every country in the world which exports to the UK," said Dutch Bike Bits on its website. "Clearly this is ludicrous for one country, but imagine if every country in the world had the same idea. "If every country decided to behave in the same way, then we would have to pay 195 fees every year, keep up with the changes in taxation law for 195 different countries, keep accounts on behalf of 195 different countries and submit payments to 195 tax offices in 195 different countries, and jump through whatever hoops were required to prove that we were doing all of this honestly and without any error." Dutch Bike Bits said it had many customers within the UK and would like to be able to trade with them. "Not being able to send parcels to the UK does not work in any way in our favour and it is not what we wanted," the firm added. "If you're angry about this, and you may well be so, please contact your elected representative in the UK." Temporary? Other firms held out the hope that their ban on exports to the UK might prove to be temporary. Scandinavian Outdoor, which is based in Finland and sells outdoor clothing and equipment, posted a message on its homepage saying: "No delivery to UK just now." In a further message explaining its decision, it said: "Due to Brexit, we have temporarily closed our store from UK-based customers. Ordering will be possible as soon as our UK VAT registration and the overall process of selling to the UK post-Brexit has been sorted out." Meanwhile, mail and freight company TNT has said it is now imposing a surcharge of £4.31 on all shipments between the UK and the EU. TNT is now owned by Federal Express, which has also "updated" its charges, a spokesperson for the two companies said. "FedEx/TNT has been making incremental investments to adjust our systems, processes, resourcing and customer-facing solutions to ensure readiness for the change on 1 January 2021," the spokesperson added. "To reflect these investments and the incremental cost of customs clearance, we are increasing transportation rates for shipments from UK to EU, and EU to UK." Rivals DHL and UPS have also taken similar measures.  # Your Output (b): Some EU specialist online retailers have said they will no longer deliver to the UK because of tax changes which came into force on 1 January. Bicycle part firm Dutch Bike Bits said from now on, it would ship to every country in the world except the UK. Another firm, Belgium-based Beer On Web, said it was now shunning the UK "due to the new Brexit measures". The companies are angry because they now face higher costs and increased bureaucracy in order to comply with UK tax authorities. However, it is unclear how many have taken the drastic step of refusing all UK orders.  # Your Evaluation: Based on the given information, I have identified the following key differences between Output (a) and Output (b):  1. Level of detail: Output (b) provides more detailed information about the measures taken by retailers to cope with Brexit, including the introduction of new VAT rules and the imposition of additional charges by international shipping companies. 2. Tone: Output (b) has a more negative tone than Output (a), with a focus on the challenges and difficulties faced by retailers due to Brexit. 3. Emphasis: Output (b) places more emphasis on the impact of Brexit on retailers, particularly the increased costs and bureaucracy associated with complying with UK tax authorities. 4. Language: Output (b) uses more technical language than Output (a), with terms such as "VAT model," "customs clearance," and "incremental investments."  Based on these differences, I would conclude that Output (b) provides a more detailed and informative response to the given instruction, while also conveying a more negative tone and emphasis on the challenges faced by retailers due to Brexit.

However, after careful evaluation, I have decided that Output (a) is better.  The reason for this decision is that Output (a) provides more detailed information about the six areas of learning and experience, which is a key aspect of the new curriculum. It also highlights the discretion given to head teachers and nurseries over English language learning, which is an important aspect of the curriculum. Additionally, Output (a) provides a clearer explanation of the curriculum's focus on life skills, communication, teamwork, and collaborative learning, which is a key feature of the new curriculum.  On the other hand, Output (b) provides a good summary of the new curriculum's key areas of focus, but it does not provide as much detail about the six areas of learning and experience. Additionally, it does not highlight the discretion given to head teachers and nurseries over English language learning, which is an important aspect of the curriculum.  Therefore, Output (a) is better at summarizing the new curriculum for Wales.

However, Output (b) provides more specific and detailed information about Allan Bonner's views, including his expectation that Michael Ignatieff will use the auditor general's report to raise questions about the Conservatives' honesty and spending. On the other hand, Output (a) provides a broader overview of the opinions of political commentators, including Rex Murphy's observation that the election has been focused on trivial matters rather than substantive issues.

Output (a): The number of UK fire and rescue staff taking long-term sick leave due to mental illness has risen by nearly a third over the last six years, figures show. By George Greenwood and Laura Harmes 5 live Investigates In London, the figure has doubled since 2011-12. Some 103 London fire staff have taken mental health leave this year, some after working at Grenfell Tower. The Home Office said it was the responsibility of fire services to put wellbeing services in place. Two-thirds of fire services provided data following a Freedom of Information request submitted by 5 live Investigates. They reveal the number of firefighters and other staff taking long-term mental health leave rose from 600 to 780 over the last six years. At least 126 staff have left the service due to mental health issues since 2011. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service only provided comparable figures for one full year. In 2016-17, 97 Scottish fire staff took long-term mental health sick leave while in Northern Ireland that figure was 111. Andy Graham, 52, is a former firefighter, who served in the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. He has suffered from PTSD for the last 30 years. Mr. Graham, who has a son and a daughter, retired last year and now trains others in mental health first aid. "When I started in the fire service in 1987 there was no proper debriefing system in place," he explained. "The first fatal incident I attended was a particularly traumatic suicide. "Within a matter of weeks, I started suffering from nightmares and panic attacks, and it snowballed from there, after attending more fatal incidents." He said that he was afraid to go to bed at night because of the nightmares. "It meant I started staying up late, drinking alcohol to help me sleep. "Through the daytime, there would be triggers that would set me off having flashbacks and panic attacks. Those triggers were blue lights, sirens, loud bangs. Seeing certain situations being depicted on TV even would set me off." Suppressed issues His son, John, was only five when his father had a breakdown. "It's horrible to bring it back, being so young and coming through the front door and seeing your dad lying on the couch with a blank look on his face, someone that you're so used to being bubbly and happy, and he doesn't even say hello to you." Andy explained that he tried to keep a lid on his issues for years. "But they were always there, bubbling under the surface. When you're in the fire service, you're told that you're the strong one, the one there to help others. "So it goes really against the grain to be asking for help. "I've been in therapy four times now, and I'm in a better place than I have been for 29 years. "Fire services have better debriefing systems than they used to, but the support is not where it needs to be yet."
