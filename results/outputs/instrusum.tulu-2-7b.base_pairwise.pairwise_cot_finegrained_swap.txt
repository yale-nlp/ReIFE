However, when Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018, he pursued reforms, which Tigray resisted, leading to a political crisis. The conflict escalated when Tigray defied the central government by holding its own regional election in September, which the central government deemed illegal. This led to tensions and the central government's decision to suspend funding for and cut ties with Tigray. The conflict began on November 4th when Abiy ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray, accusing them of attacking a military base.  Output (b) provides a more concise summary of the conflict, focusing on the military offensive and the attack on the military base.

Therefore, Output (a) is better.  Differences Identification: 1. Output (a) provides a summary of the opinions and ideas of different political parties regarding apprenticeships, while Output (b) only provides a summary of the Conservative and Labour parties' opinions. 2. Output (a) mentions the pledges made by the Liberal Democrats, UKIP, Green Party, SNP, and Plaid Cymru, while Output (b) only mentions the Conservative and Labour parties' pledges.  Explanation and Rationale: The article discusses the opinions and ideas of different people regarding apprenticeships. The Conservatives want to create 16,000 new apprenticeships, with a promise to create an extra three million 'training places' if the party remains in power after the general election in May. They want to pay for it with money saved from benefits caps. Baroness Brady, a Tory peer and star of The Apprentice (fittingly enough), said the party wants apprenticeships to be held on par with degrees. Labour has pledged to create 80,000 more apprenticeships. However, 33,000 of those would come from just one project, the High Speed 2 rail line (HS2). That raises questions about what will happen once that project is complete, or if it suffers any delays. Ed Miliband has promised apprenticeships to every school leaver who "gets the grades" - that's level 3 qualifications, which are equivalent to having two A-levels. Those with two A-Levels will also qualify, but the scheme will exclude those who only have GCSEs. The party has also announced plans to boost job prospects for young people by giving teenagers face-to-face advice in schools. That will include steering people towards more apprenticeships, rather than directing them towards university or unskilled jobs. The scheme has been budgeted at £50m. Nick Clegg has pledged to expand apprenticeships and develop national colleges for vocational skills. He wants to end the "barely concealed snobbery" about apprenticeships, which he claims comes from adults, rather than young people. The Lib Dems have gone to great lengths to point out the two million apprenticeships available under the coalition, stating that he and Vince Cable have been instrumental in pushing for them. The party told Newsbeat it wants to double that number in the next parliament. UKIP has pledged to introduce an option for students to take an apprenticeship (with a qualification at the end) instead of four non-core GCSE subjects. The employers they work with will be qualified to test and grade the apprentices, and the students can carry on working with them through their A-levels. The party has also promised to scrap the target of 50% of school leavers going on to university, while scrapping tuition fees for some students taking degrees in high-demand vocational subjects like maths, technology, engineering, medicine and science - so long as they live, work and pay taxes in the UK for five years after they graduate. The Green Party hasn't published a specific policy on apprenticeships, but told Newsbeat: "[We] would expand apprenticeships by increasing funding. "We would ensure the government provides an apprenticeship to all qualified young people aged 16-25 who do not have one and want one. "{We would implement] a qualifications framework that would allow a real choice of academic and vocational areas, or a mixture of both. "With students encouraged to have an understanding of a wide range of subjects, and allowed to pursue areas where their talents lie, they will have the best possible start to their careers." The SNP has pledged to provide 125,000 "modern" apprenticeships in the next parliament, while also promising that every 16 to 19-year-old in the country who's out of work or training will be offered a place on a training or learning scheme. The party has broken this down into at least 30,000 new apprenticeships every year, with a specific campaign on getting more women into vocational training. "The SNP has been determined to do all that we can to encourage greater equality and ensure that there should be no industry or sector where women cannot build careers that are every bit as successful as their male counterparts." The party has suggested it wants as many of the new jobs as possible to be in emerging high-tech industries such as renewable energy and life sciences. Plaid Cymru Plaid has pledged to support the European Union's Youth Jobs Guarantee that will provide training or employment to any young person under 25 who has been out of work for more than four months in an effort, they say, to tackle the root of youth unemployment. They want to promote higher level apprenticeships and in-work learning, both for young people and adults.  In summary, Output (a) provides a comprehensive overview of the opinions and ideas of different political parties regarding apprenticeships, while Output (b) only provides a limited summary of the Conservative and Labour parties' opinions. Therefore, Output (a) is better as it provides a more comprehensive and detailed overview of the different parties' stances on apprenticeships.
