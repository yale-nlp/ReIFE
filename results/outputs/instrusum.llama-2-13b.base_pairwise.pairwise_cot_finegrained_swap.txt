Quantum computers have long been touted as incredibly powerful machines that will be able to solve hugely complex computational problems much faster than any computer we have available today. But no-one can agree on the best way to make them. Who will win the race? By Mary-Ann RussonTechnology of Business reporter Superfast quantum computers could speed up the discovery of new medicines, crack the most complex cryptographic security systems, design new materials, model climate change, and supercharge artificial intelligence, computer scientists say. But there's currently no consensus on the best way to make them or how to make them available to the mass market. Physicists, engineers and computer scientists around the world are trying to develop four very different types of quantum computers, based around light particles, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, or nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamonds. Companies like IBM, Google, Rigetti, Intel and Microsoft are currently leading the quantum charge. Each method has its pros and cons, but the overarching challenge is the fragile nature of quantum itself. What is quantum computing? Instead of using ones and noughts called bits, representing on or off, in long sequences as in classical computing a quantum bit - or qubit - uses the near magical properties of sub-atomic particles. Electrons or photons, for example, can be in two states at the same time - a phenomenon called superposition. As a result, a qubit-based computer can do far more calculations much faster than a conventional computer. "If you had a two-qubit computer and you add two qubits, it becomes a four-qubit computer. But you're not doubling the computer power, you're increasing it exponentially," explains Martin Giles, San Francisco bureau chief of the MIT Technology Review. Computer scientists sometimes describe this quantum computing effect as like being able to go down each path of a very complex maze at the same time. Qubits can also influence each other even when they're not physically connected, a process called "entanglement". In computing terms, this gives them the ability to make logical leaps conventional computers never could. The search for stability But qubits are highly unstable and prone to interference or "noise" from other sources of energy, leading to errors in calculations. So the race is one to find a way to stabilise them for mass-production. Computing giant IBM firmly believes that "transmon superconducting qubits" hold the most promise for quantum computing, and they have three prototype quantum processors that the public can access in the cloud. "So far, over 94,000 people have accessed IBM quantum computers in the cloud. They've run over five million experiments and written 110 papers," says Dr Robert Sutor, vice president for quantum computing strategy and ecosystem at IBM Research. "People are learning and experimenting... we hope in three to five years to be able to point at one specific example, and say that quantum significantly improves on anything classical computers can do." But IBM's method required the quantum computer to be stored within a large fridge, where the qubits are stored at temperatures close to absolute zero to ensure that they remain in their useful states. This means it would be extremely hard to miniaturise, and thus very expensive. "It seems likely that superconducting qubits will be among the first technologies to enable useful quantum computation," says Joseph Fitzsimons, a principal investigator at the National University of Singapore's Centre of Quantum Technologies. "However, my impression is that they are analogous to vacuum tubes in early computers, rather than transistors which came along later. "We may yet see another technology emerge which becomes the ultimate winner." Microsoft and academics at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen are working on what they believe will be much more stable qubits based on so-called Majorana particles. While other teams are working on trapping qubits in silicon - the material traditional computer chips have been made from. And computer scientists at Oxford University are looking at ways to link smaller qubit computers rather than creating bigger computers with lots of qubits. There are many ways to skin Schrodinger's Cat it seems. Classical potential? While we wait for quantum computers, what's the future for conventional, or classical, computing? In July, Ewin Tang, an 18-year-old graduate in computer science and mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin, made waves in the international computing world by developing a classical computer algorithm that can solve a problem almost as fast as a quantum computer. The problem involved developing a recommendation engine that suggests products to users based on data about their preferences. And the EU recently announced it is working on the next generation of computers - exascale - which would enable a billion billion calculations per second. "Exascale means 10 to the power of 18 operations per second," explains says Prof Scott Aaronson, a theoretical computer scientist at UT Austin who mentored Mr Tang. "10 to the power of 18 is big, but quantum systems, which will be capable of 10 to the power of 1,000 operations per second, is much, much bigger." And the problem for classical computing is that we are reaching the limits of how many transistors we can fit onto a chip - Apple's A11 squeezes in an astonishing 4.3 billion, for example. Moore's Law - that every two years, microprocessors will get twice as fast, use half as much energy, and take up half as much space - is finally breaking down. Quantum leap Even if a stable, mass-produced quantum computer always remains elusive, the research is already yielding interesting results. "If we hadn't invested in quantum computing, the quantum algorithm that inspired Mr Tang wouldn't have existed," says Prof Robert Young, a Royal Society research fellow and director of the University of Lancaster's Quantum Technology Centre. More Technology of Business Already, he says that quantum research has yielded a new way to cool devices to low temperatures; light-based chip enhancements that have improved the fibre optic broadband experience; and the invention of lab-on-a-chip technologies to speed up the diagnosis of illnesses. "The real benefit of going to the Moon wasn't going to the Moon, it was the peripheral technologies that were developed on the way," says Prof Young - GPS satellite navigation and ball point pens that write upside down, to name but two.

argue that we have not tried enough in our search for extraterrestrial life.  # Output (a): The possible explanations supporting the idea that aliens don't exist include the Fermi Paradox, which highlights the lack of evidence for intelligent life despite high estimates, and the Rare Earth hypothesis, which argues that the unique and intricate design of our planet makes life elsewhere almost impossible. Additionally, some scientists believe that the window of opportunity for other civilizations to have similar technology as ours is incredibly small, making contact unlikely. Another theory suggests that with intelligence comes self-destruction, implying that advanced civilizations may have destroyed themselves before making contact. However, Dr. Frank Drake believes that we have not tried enough in our search for extraterrestrial life, and that we may still have a long way to go before we have a good chance of succeeding.  Please select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response based on the given evaluation criteria.
rom of Oxford University has posed the question whether humans are living in a computer simulation created by beings with a superior intellect.  # Output (a): The article explores the question of whether or not we are alone in the galaxy. It discusses the Drake Equation, which estimates the number of civilizations that could communicate with Earth, and the Fermi Paradox, which highlights the lack of evidence despite high estimates of intelligent life. The Rare Earth hypothesis is also mentioned, suggesting that the intricate design of our planet makes life almost impossible.

ences and circumstances that must occur together make life almost impossible. Additionally, the possibility that we are living in a computer simulation created by beings with a superior intellect is also mentioned.  # Output (a): The article explores the question of whether or not we are alone in the galaxy. It discusses the Drake Equation, which estimates the number of civilizations that might be able to communicate with Earth, and the Fermi Paradox, which highlights the discrepancy between the high estimates of intelligent life and the lack of evidence. The article also touches on the idea that advanced civilizations may have self-destructed, and the possibility that we are living in a computer simulation. Additionally, the article mentions the Rare Earth hypothesis, which suggests that the conditions that allow for life on Earth are unique in the universe.  Differences Identification:  1. Output (b) mentions the possibility that we are living in a computer simulation created by beings with a superior intellect, while Output (a) does not mention this theory. 2. Output (b) uses the phrase "we haven't found aliens" while Output (a) uses the phrase "the lack of evidence put forward." 3. Output (b) mentions the Rare Earth hypothesis, but does not provide as much detail as Output (a).

political consultant, said Mr Ignatieff had to seize the opportunity in the debates to demonstrate that he has leadership qualities and to use the auditor general's report as a "springboard" to raise questions in voters' minds about the Conservatives' honesty and spending.  # Output (a): Rex Murphy, one of Canada's best known TV and radio political commentators, said the election had been fought over trivial matters rather than substantive issues - the format of the debate and Mr Ignatieff's political style, for example, rather than the global economy, Japan, Libya and energy policy.  Please evaluate which output is better based on the given evaluation plan.
atieff needs to show a broader performance, a deeper knowledge of the issues, and deliver soaring rhetoric in the debates to prove his leadership qualities.  # Output (a): John Ivison believes that the Liberals are trying to take advantage of the crowded and divided opposition to attract leftist New Democrat voters by promising virtually identical things to NDP voters.

." Four hours later, Edmund also passed away.  The second example is of Don and Maxine Simpson, who were married for 67 years. Maxine died first, and four hours later, Don followed.  The article notes that research has found that the number of people who have a heart attack or stroke in the month after a loved one dies is double that of a control group. The condition is known as "broken heart syndrome," and it is thought to be caused by the sudden release of hormones, such as adrenaline, which can stun the heart muscle.  The article also notes that the risk of death for the surviving partner is increased for six months after their partner's death, and that a mutually supportive marriage can act as a buffer against stress.  # Output (a): The article discusses the phenomenon of people dying shortly after their loved ones, and cites two examples of couples who died within days of each other. It notes that there is scientific evidence to support the idea that grief can cause heart problems, and that the condition is known as "broken heart syndrome."  The article also notes that the risk of death for the surviving partner is increased for six months after their partner's death, and that a mutually supportive marriage can act as a buffer against stress.  Based on the given requirements, I would select Output (b) as the better response. Here's why:  Differences Identification:  1. Output (b) provides more specific examples of couples who died within days of each other, whereas Output (a) only mentions the phenomenon in general terms. 2. Output (b) provides more information about the scientific evidence supporting the idea that grief can cause heart problems, including the name of the condition ("broken heart syndrome") and the hormones involved (adrenaline). 3. Output (b) provides more details about the risk of death for the surviving partner, including the time frame (six months) and the buffering effect of a supportive marriage.  Explanation and Rationale:  Based on the given requirements, Output (b) provides more specific and detailed information about the phenomenon of "dying of a broken heart," including examples of couples who died within days of each other, the scientific evidence supporting the idea, and the risk of death for the surviving partner. Output (a), on the other hand, provides more general information about the phenomenon and does not provide specific examples or details about the scientific evidence or the risk of death for the surviving partner. Therefore, Output (b) is the better response.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (b) is better.
on by a shock such as bereavement.  # Output (a): According to Dr. Sunil Shah of St George's at the University of London, bereavement can have a direct effect on the health of the heart, as their study found that the number of people who had a heart attack or stroke in the month after a loved one died was double that of a non-grieving control group. The British Heart Foundation states that "broken heart syndrome," or stress cardiomyopathy, is a temporary condition where the heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or stunned, often brought on by a shock such as bereavement.

erals, which includes sharing the proceeds with developing countries. However, conservation experts have warned that mining the seabed will be highly destructive and could have disastrous long-term consequences for marine life.  # Output (a): Deep sea mining has the potential to provide a wide range of benefits, including the extraction of gold, copper, manganese, cobalt and other metals from the ocean floor. An assessment of the eastern Pacific found that more than 27 billion tonnes of mineral-rich rocks, containing seven billion tonnes of manganese, 340 million tonnes of nickel, 290 million tonnes of copper and 78 million tonnes of cobalt, could be lying on the seabed. The United Nations has published its first plan for managing the extraction of these minerals, which includes sharing the proceeds with developing countries. However, conservation experts have warned that mining the seabed will be highly destructive and could have disastrous long-term consequences for marine life. Additionally, the ISA faces the challenge of trying to ensure that nodule mining's benefits will reach beyond the companies themselves while also fostering commercially viable operations.  Please select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction.
