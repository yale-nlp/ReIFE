that came into effect on January 1st. These retailers, such as Dutch Bike Bits and Beer On Web, are now facing higher costs and increased bureaucracy in order to comply with UK tax authorities. Additionally, international shipping companies, including Federal Express and TNT, have introduced additional charges on shipments between the UK and the EU. These changes follow the implementation of new VAT rules by HM Revenue and Customs, which now collect VAT at the point of sale rather than at the point of importation. This means that overseas retailers sending goods to the UK are required to register for UK VAT and account for it to HMRC if the sale value is less than €150 (£135).  The measures taken by these retailers and shipping companies are in response to the new VAT rules and the increased investment required to adjust their systems to cope with Brexit. However, it is unclear how many retailers have taken the drastic step of refusing all UK orders. The government has stated that the new VAT model ensures goods from EU and non-EU countries are treated in the same way and that UK businesses are not disadvantaged by competition from VAT-free imports. The new system also addresses the problem of overseas sellers failing to pay the right amount of VAT on sales of goods already in the UK at the point of sale.  Campaigner Richard Allen, founder of Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, has expressed concerns about the massive increase in international online shopping leading to VAT evasion on a large scale. He believes that the new HMRC rules are aimed at tackling this issue, but it is unclear how firms who fail to register for UK VAT will be dealt with. Dutch Bike Bits has criticized the new VAT rules, stating that they intend to charge a fee to every company in the world in every country in the world which exports to the UK. They argue that this is an unfair and unrealistic expectation.  In summary, the measures taken by retailers and shipping companies in response to the new VAT rules and Brexit include stopping deliveries to the UK, introducing additional charges on shipments between the UK and the EU, and adjusting their systems to comply with the new regulations. While the government has stated that the new VAT model is aimed at ensuring fair treatment for all, concerns have been raised about the feasibility and potential impact of these measures.  # Conclusion: Based on the analysis of both outputs, it is clear that both Output (a) and Output (b) provide a similar summary of the measures taken by retailers and shipping companies in response to the new VAT rules and Brexit.
