However, Output (a) is more helpful in that it directly states the outcome of the investigation by Lloyds and emphasizes the refund and compensation, making it clear that the issue was resolved. It also highlights Sue's feelings and her desire for accountability, which adds a personal touch to the summary.  Output (b), while also providing the necessary information, does not explicitly mention the refund and compensation from Lloyds. Instead, it focuses on the initial responses and the eventual cooperation from both Lloyds and Vodafone.
