It provides a concise and focused summary of the measures retailer companies have taken to cope with Brexit, as requested by the instruction. It highlights the stopping of deliveries to the UK by several EU specialist online retailers due to tax changes and increased bureaucracy, as well as the temporary halt by some firms until they sort out their UK VAT registration and post-Brexit processes. Additionally, it mentions the extra charges imposed by international shipping companies on shipments between the UK and the EU. This output closely executes the instruction by providing a clear and relevant summary of the actions taken by retailer companies in response to Brexit.  On the other hand, Output (b) includes more background information and details about the tax changes and their implications, but it does not as clearly summarize the specific measures taken by retailer companies to cope with Brexit. While it does mention some of the actions taken by retailers, it does not provide as focused a summary as Output (a).  Considering the requirement to summarize the measures taken by retailer companies, Output (a) is more focused and concise, while Output (b) provides additional context but does not directly address the instruction as effectively.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.

Output (a) focuses solely on the potential benefits of deep sea mining, providing specific figures and details about the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. This aligns well with the instruction's requirement to summarize the potential benefits. On the other hand, Output (b) also mentions the potential benefits but includes a discussion on the uncertainties and environmental concerns, which, while important, is not the primary focus of the instruction.  However, as a Critic, I must consider the clarity and fluency of the writing in the summaries. Upon reading both outputs, Output (a) is more concise and directly addresses the instruction without unnecessary elaboration. Output (b), while not incorrect, includes information that deviates from the focus on benefits, which may confuse readers or dilute the main message.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.
