Output (b), while still providing the required information, adds context about the magazine's decision to stop publishing nude photos, which might be relevant to some readers but is not strictly necessary for fulfilling the summary requirement.

Explanation and Rationale: Output (a) better addresses the summary requirement by providing relevant context and information about the change in the magazine's format, which is directly related to the list of celebrities mentioned.

Output (a) explicitly mentions the Convention on the Law of the Sea and the ISA's goal to manage mining for the wider benefit of humanity.  Explanation and Rationale: Output (a) is more precise and informative, as it specifies the Clarion-Clipperton Zone's location and provides the name of the overseeing authority. It also gives context to the ISA's role in managing the process and the global implications of the mining. Output (b) omits these details, which are relevant to understanding the potential benefits and the regulatory framework surrounding deep sea mining.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.
