While the directive has the potential to improve crime prevention, there are concerns about its privacy implications.    **Output (a)** highlights the concerns of the European Digital Rights (EDRI) campaign group, the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), and critics who argue that the directive is overly intrusive and may infringe on fundamental privacy rights. The concerns include the lengthy data retention period, the potential for discriminatory profiling, and the ineffectiveness of PNR in addressing terrorism.    **Output (b)** emphasizes the arguments of the EDRI and FRA about the need for statistical analysis to ensure that the directive is effective and to protect against discrimination.    **Therefore, Output (a) is better.** The concerns raised in Output (a) are more comprehensive and address the potential impact of the directive on individuals' privacy and rights. While Output (b) raises valid points about the need for statistical analysis, it does not delve into the broader privacy concerns as extensively as Output (a).
