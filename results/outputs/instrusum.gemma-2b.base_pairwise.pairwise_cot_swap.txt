**Therefore, Output (a) is better.**    The decline of the Bridgend engine plant is a result of the shift in gear that has been going on since the early 1990s. By operating as a global company, Ford standardized models across the world and invested in the most efficient plants. This put pressure on the Bridgend plant, which had to compete with other Ford engine plants globally. With Brexit on the horizon, factories making engines in the UK will have to be even more efficient to stay open.
**Therefore, Output (a) is better.**    The Bridgend engine plant faced pressure due to the shift in global focus and the decision to "go global" by Ford HQ in the US. The plant was already operating at a reduced capacity and was under pressure to compete globally. Additionally, Brexit and trade barriers could further impact the plant's operations.
**Therefore, Output (a) is better.**    The Bridgend engine plant faced increasing competition and pressure from other Ford engine plants globally.
