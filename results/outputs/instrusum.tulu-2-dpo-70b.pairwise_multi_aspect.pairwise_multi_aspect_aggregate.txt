Given that the instruction asks for a summary in one sentence, I believe that brevity is an important factor to consider.

After considering the analyses for each aspect, it is clear that both Output (a) and Output (b) are well-written and accurately summarize the aftermath of sexual harassment on Meena. However, Output (b) provides a more comprehensive and detailed perspective on the emotional, psychological, and financial impacts Meena experienced.

Output (a): Lloyds Bank has apologized and refunded over £14,000, plus interest and £600 in compensation, to a woman whose late mother's account was targeted by direct debit fraud. The bank initially claimed the direct debits were legitimately set up and refused to refund the money. After being contacted by BBC Money Box, Lloyds conducted a new investigation and admitted its initial response was wrong. Vodafone, which received most of the stolen funds, is also reviewing the case and will provide details of a possible suspect to the police.  Output (b) provides a more detailed summary of the entire article, but it does not fully meet the criteria of focusing on the conclusion of the fraud case. Therefore, it is less suitable for the given requirement.  Output (b): The article discusses a case of fraud where a woman's mother had over 14,000 pounds stolen from her through direct debit fraud. The daughter, Sue, was outraged and contacted her mother's bank, Lloyds, and the company that the direct debits were being paid to, Vodafone. Both Lloyds and Vodafone told her that there was nothing they could do and that the direct debits had been "legitimately" set up. Sue then contacted her local police force and Action Fraud, but was told that it was unlikely any further action would be taken. Lloyds eventually agreed to refund the money stolen from Margaret's account, plus interest and compensation, after being contacted by the BBC. Vodafone said that it was also looking into the case and would provide the details of an individual who may have used Margaret's account to the police.

It meets the criteria of text quality, information richness, user intention inference, accuracy, and completeness of instruction following by providing a more thorough and informative summary of the condition. Output (a) provides a concise summary, but it lacks the level of detail and completeness that Output (b) offers. Therefore, Output (b) is better.
After analyzing both outputs based on the provided aspects, I have determined that Output (a) is better. This output provides a more comprehensive and detailed summary of the symptoms of prosopagnosia, including the two main forms of the condition, their prevalence, and the specific area of the brain affected in acquired prosopagnosia. It also mentions the lack of a cure and the coping strategies people with the condition often develop.  Output (a) excels in aspects such as text quality, information richness, user intention inference, accuracy, and completeness of instruction following. It offers a more professional and informative response, making it suitable for a wider range of contexts and audiences.  Output (b), while accurate and concise, is less detailed and comprehensive.

After considering the analyses of multiple aspects, I have determined that Output (a) is better. This output provides a more comprehensive and detailed summary of the symptoms of prosopagnosia, which is important for effectively conveying the condition's impact on daily life. While Output (b) is more concise, it may not provide enough information for someone who is unfamiliar with the condition. Both outputs are accurate, follow the instructions, and are of high quality, but Output (a) offers a more complete picture of the symptoms of prosopagnosia. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
After evaluating both Output (a) and Output (b) based on the aspects of text quality, information richness, user intention inference, accuracy, and completeness of instruction following, I find that both outputs provide accurate and relevant information about the symptoms of prosopagnosia.

Given that the instruction task asks for a summary of the symptoms of prosopagnosia, a more comprehensive explanation would be more helpful in providing a better understanding of the condition. Therefore, Output (a) is better.  Output (a): Prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, is a condition where individuals cannot recognize faces, including those of their loved ones. People with this condition can see individual facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth, but cannot process them as a whole, making it difficult to recognize gestures or emotions. This can lead to social embarrassment and challenges in daily life, as affected individuals may not recognize friends, family members, or colleagues in various situations.  Output (b): Prosopagnosia is a condition in which people cannot recognize faces, even if they can see the eyes, nose, and mouth. People with this condition cannot recognize gestures or emotions, and may not recognize even close friends or family members if they are not expecting to see them. It can be caused by birth defects or brain injuries, and has no cure. People with prosopagnosia may develop strategies to cope, but these are not foolproof.
After analyzing the aspects provided by the critic, it is clear that both Output (a) and Output (b) are accurate, concise, and provide relevant information about the symptoms of prosopagnosia.

Home's launch comes three months after the Whitworth gallery reopened after a £19m expansion, and there are also plans for another new £78m venue called The Factory. Home provides more space to cater for Manchester's "hunger for new ideas" and will feature contemporary, intelligent, international-flavoured offerings. It is hoped that Home will boost the economy by attracting other businesses to its part of the city centre.
