The general public, the scientist, and the critic have pointed out that Output (a) correctly identifies the meaning of the phrase "smaller fish to fry" as being a variation of the idiom "bigger fish to fry," which means having more important or pressing matters to attend to. This is the widely accepted and common meaning of the phrase.  On the other hand, Output (b) provides a valid interpretation of the phrase but inadvertently reverses the order of the phrase and presents a less common meaning. While Output (b) is still informative, it does not precisely execute the instruction as it does not accurately represent the common understanding of the phrase.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.
