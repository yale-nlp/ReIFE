Answer (a) is better.  In my own answer, I would have summarized the conclusion of the fraud case as follows:  The article discusses a case of fraud where a woman's mother had over 14,000 pounds stolen from her through direct debit fraud. The daughter, Sue, was outraged and contacted her mother's bank, Lloyds, and the company that the direct debits were being paid to, Vodafone. Both Lloyds and Vodafone told her that there was nothing they could do and that the direct debits had been "legitimately" set up. Sue then contacted her local police force and Action Fraud, but was told that it was unlikely any further action would be taken. Lloyds eventually agreed to refund the money stolen from Margaret's account, plus interest and compensation, after being contacted by the BBC. Vodafone said that it was also looking into the case and would provide the details of an individual who may have used Margaret's account to the police.  In comparing both assistants' answers with my answer, I found that both assistants provided a summary of the conclusion of the fraud case.

Answer (a) is better.  In my evaluation, both answers provided a good summary of the changes in American alcohol consumption. However, Answer (a) provided more specific details about the history of alcohol consumption in America, including the period of Prohibition and the impact it had on alcohol consumption. It also mentioned the fact that presidents have been seen drinking socially, which adds a unique perspective to the topic.  Answer (b), on the other hand, provided a more general overview of the changes in alcohol consumption, but it did not provide any specific details about the period of Prohibition or the impact it had on alcohol consumption.  Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
Answer (a) is better.  In summary, the article discusses the history of alcohol consumption in America, from the Puritans' approval of alcohol to the peak of consumption in 1830 and the subsequent moral issue of alcoholism. Prohibition was introduced in 1917, but it did not ban alcohol consumption entirely, leading to the rise of speakeasies and organized crime. The cost of enforcing Prohibition became prohibitive, and it was eventually repealed in 1933. Today, Americans consume an average of 2.3 gallons of pure alcohol per year, compared to 5.8 gallons in 1790 and 7.1 gallons in 1830. The American presidency has played a role in rehabilitating alcohol and making it respectable again.  Answer (a) provides a clear and concise summary of the changes in American alcohol consumption, highlighting the key points of the article and providing relevant information. The answer is creative and novel in its approach, focusing on the historical context and the impact of Prohibition on alcohol consumption.  Answer (b) is less helpful and less concise, as it does not provide a clear summary of the changes in American alcohol consumption. The answer is more focused on the history of alcohol consumption and the impact of Prohibition, but it does not provide a clear comparison between the different time periods.  Therefore, Answer (a) is better.

The summary provided by Assistant B accurately captures the founders' perspective on the purpose of their app, which is to provide a platform for users to share information and feelings anonymously, without the fear of being identified. They believe that Secret can help train users in empathy, as it allows them to share experiences and emotions that they might not feel comfortable sharing on other social media platforms. This summary is concise, relevant, and helpful, and it does not contain any inaccuracies or mistakes.  In contrast, Answer (a) is less clear and concise, and it does not fully capture the founders' perspective on the purpose of their app. The summary suggests that the founders believe that Facebook has trained users to curate their identity, and that Secret can help train us in empathy. However, it does not provide a clear explanation of how the app can achieve this or what the founders mean by "empathy."
