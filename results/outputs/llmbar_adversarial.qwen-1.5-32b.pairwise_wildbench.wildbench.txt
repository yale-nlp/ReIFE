However, some facts might be less well-known or potentially misleading, such as 'The average cat has ten lives' which is a common expression rather than a factual statement. Additionally, the claim that cats are almost immune to rabies is not entirely accurate, as they can contract the disease but are less susceptible than some other animals.",     "reason of A=B": "Both responses provide a list of ten items, are factually correct, and pertain specifically to cats.",     "reason of A>B": "Response A covers a wider range of aspects, including hunting, climbing, and anatomy, which might be more interesting to a general audience. The language used in Response A is slightly more concise and clear.",     "reason of B>A": "Response B includes some less common facts, like cats' ability to walk on walls and their vertical iris, which might be more surprising and engaging for the user. However, it also contains a potentially misleading statement about cats having 'ten lives' and an imprecise statement about their immunity to rabies.",     "choice": "Response (A)" }
