Front (TPLF), a dominant political party in Tigray, was sidelined by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who took office in 2018. Abiy pursued reforms, but when Tigray resisted, a political crisis ensued. The crisis can be traced back to Ethiopia's federal system, which was set up by the TPLF. Tigray's leaders see Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralize power and destroy the federal system. The feud escalated when Tigray held its own regional election in September, defying the central government, which had postponed national elections due to the coronavirus. The rift grew in October when the central government suspended funding and cut ties with Tigray. Tensions increased, leading to military confrontation in November when Abiy ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray.  # Output (b): The conflict between the Ethiopian government and the Tigray region is rooted in a power struggle, political reforms, and an election. The TPLF, a key political party in Tigray, was marginalized by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who took office in 2018. Abiy's reforms led to a political crisis, as Tigray resisted them. The crisis is linked to Ethiopia's federal system, established by the TPLF. Tigray's leaders view Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralize power. The situation worsened when Tigray held its own regional election in September, defying the central government's postponement of national elections due to the coronavirus.

However, Output (a) provides slightly more detail about the specific consequences Meena faced, such as threats and the need to repay a loan. This additional information makes Output (a) more comprehensive and precise in summarizing the aftermath of sexual harassment on Meena. Although Output (b) captures the emotional impact well, it lacks the specificity of Output (a) in terms of the practical consequences Meena encountered.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Differences Identification: 1. Output (a) focuses on Meena losing her job and suffering from depression and nightmares, while Output (b) includes fear, depression, shame, guilt, and financial struggles as the aftermath of sexual harassment.  Explanation and Rationale: Both Output (a) and Output (b) address the summary requirement by mentioning the aftermath of sexual harassment on Meena. However, Output (b) provides a more comprehensive and detailed summary by including a wider range of emotional and financial consequences that Meena faced. It captures the multifaceted impact of sexual harassment on her life, which is crucial for understanding the gravity of the situation. Although Output (a) mentions losing her job, it does not convey the full extent of Meena's suffering.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (b) is better.

Output (a): - The Theatre (1576): First purpose-built theatre in Britain since Roman times, located in Shoreditch. Believed to be where Romeo and Juliet was first performed. - The Curtain (1577): Built 100 yards south of The Theatre. Excavation work revealed foundations, and Hackney Council approved redevelopment including a permanent display. - Globe Theatre (1599): Shakespeare's theatre group established it south of the river. The original site was identified in 1980s and is now a car park with a plaque. The reconstructed Shakespeare's Globe is nearby. - The Rose (1587): Opened before the Globe, believed to have hosted Titus Andronicus. Foundations flooded in 1989 to preserve them.  All theatres were destroyed by Puritans in the 1640s, the Great Fire of 1666, World War II bombing, and general indifference.  Output (b): - The Theatre (1576): First purpose-built theatre in Britain since Roman times, located in Shoreditch. Believed to be where Romeo and Juliet was first performed. A new 235-seat theatre is proposed as part of the site's redevelopment. - The Curtain (1577): Built 100 yards south of The Theatre.

Output (a) mentions that The Theatre's site is believed to be where Romeo and Juliet was first performed, while Output (b) mentions a new 235-seat theatre proposed for the site's redevelopment.  Explanation and Rationale: The instruction asks for a summary of the old London theatres in a timeline. Output (a) provides a concise summary of the key information about each theatre, including their establishment, notable plays, and ultimate destruction. This output closely executes the instruction by providing a clear and focused timeline. On the other hand, Output (b) omits the information about the destruction of the theatres, which is an important aspect of their history. Additionally, the inclusion of the new 235-seat theatre proposal for The Theatre's site adds unnecessary detail that deviates from the focus on old London theatres. Therefore, Output (a) is better.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Output (a): - 1576: The Theatre, the first purpose-built home for drama in Britain since Roman times, was built in Shoreditch. - 1599: Shakespeare's theatre group, the Chamberlain's Men, moved to the Globe theatre in Southwark. - 1587: The Rose theatre was opened in 1587, predating the Globe. - 1640s: The theatres were destroyed by Puritan distaste for theatre. - 1666: The Great Fire of London further destroyed the theatres. - World War II bombing caused more damage to the sites.

Explanation and Rationale: Both Output (a) and Output (b) provide a timeline summarizing the information about the old London theatres. However, Output (a) places more emphasis on the chronological order of events, starting with the construction of The Theatre in 1576, which was the first purpose-built home for drama in Britain since Roman times. This is an important detail that sets the context for the subsequent developments in the timeline.  Output (b) rearranges the order of events slightly, placing the opening of The Rose theatre before the establishment of the Globe theatre by Shakespeare's theatre group. While this does not change the overall understanding of the timeline, it slightly alters the emphasis on the significance of the Globe theatre, which is arguably the most well-known of the three theatres mentioned.  Considering the differences and the overall clarity and coherence of the timeline, Output (a) provides a more focused and contextually accurate summary of the information about the old London theatres.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.

will include steering people towards more apprenticeships, rather than directing them towards university or unskilled jobs. The scheme has been budgeted at £50m. UKIP has pledged to introduce an option for students to take an apprenticeship (with a qualification at the end) instead of four non-core GCSE subjects. The employers they work with will be qualified to test and grade the apprentices, and the students can carry on working with them through their A-levels. The party has also promised to scrap the target of 50% of school leavers going on to university, while scrapping tuition fees for some students taking degrees in high-demand vocational subjects like maths, technology, engineering, medicine and science - so long as they live, work and pay taxes in the UK for five years after they graduate. The Green Party hasn't published a specific policy on apprenticeships, but told Newsbeat: "[We] would expand apprenticeships by increasing funding. "We would ensure the government provides an apprenticeship to all qualified young people aged 16-25 who do not have one and want one. "{We would implement] a qualifications framework that would allow a real choice of academic and vocational areas, or a mixture of both. "With students encouraged to have an understanding of a wide range of subjects, and allowed to pursue areas where their talents lie, they will have the best possible start to their careers." The SNP has pledged to provide 125,000 "modern" apprenticeships in the next parliament, while also promising that every 16 to 19-year-old in the country who's out of work or training will be offered a place on a training or learning scheme. The party has broken this down into at least 30,000 new apprenticeships every year, with a specific campaign on getting more women into vocational training. The party has suggested it wants as many of the new jobs as possible to be in emerging high-tech industries such as renewable energy and life sciences. Plaid Cymru has pledged to support the European Union's Youth Jobs Guarantee that will provide training or employment to any young person under 25 who has been out of work for more than four months in an effort, they say, to tackle the root of youth unemployment. They want to promote higher level apprenticeships and in-work learning, both for young people and adults.  # Output (b): The article discusses the opinions and ideas of different political parties regarding apprenticeships. The Conservatives plan to create 16,000 new apprenticeships and aim to create an additional three million 'training places' if they remain in power. Labour has pledged to create 80,000 more apprenticeships, with 33,000 coming from the High Speed 2 rail line project. UKIP proposes an option for students to take an apprenticeship instead of four non-core GCSE subjects, and the Green Party intends to expand apprenticeships by increasing funding.

on sales of goods already in the UK at the point of sale, raising an anticipated £300m every year. "Many EU businesses which currently sell goods to UK customers will have already registered for UK VAT under existing rules and HMRC is working very closely with those who haven't to ensure they can comply with the changes."  Tackling evasion Adam French, Which? consumer rights expert, said consumers would be "frustrated" if the new VAT rules were applied in a way that causes significant inconvenience. "It's vital the government makes it clear to consumers as well as traders what the changes as a result of Brexit mean for them and how they shop. It should also work to ensure UK consumers can retain access to a wide range of competitively priced and quality goods."  Campaigner Richard Allen, founder of Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, told the BBC that the massive increase in international online shopping had led to VAT evasion on a huge scale. He said the new HMRC rules were aimed at tackling that, but it was unclear how firms who failed to register for UK VAT would be dealt with.  Dutch Bike Bits said it had many customers within the UK and would like to be able to trade with them. "Not being able to send parcels to the UK does not work in any way in our favour and it is not what we wanted," the firm added.  Temporary? Other firms held out the hope that their ban on exports to the UK might prove to be temporary. Scandinavian Outdoor, which is based in Finland and sells outdoor clothing and equipment, posted a message on its homepage saying: "No delivery to UK just now." In a further message explaining its decision, it said: "Due to Brexit, we have temporarily closed our store from UK-based customers. Ordering will be possible as soon as our UK VAT registration and the overall process of selling to the UK post-Brexit has been sorted out."  Meanwhile, mail and freight company TNT has said it is now imposing a surcharge of £4.31 on all shipments between the UK and the EU. TNT is now owned by Federal Express, which has also "updated" its charges, a spokesperson for the two companies said.  Rivals DHL and UPS have also taken similar measures.  # Output (b): Some EU specialist online retailers, such as Dutch Bike Bits and Belgium-based Beer On Web, have stopped delivering to the UK due to tax changes that came into effect on 1 January. These changes require overseas retailers sending goods to the UK to register for UK VAT and account for it to HMRC if the sale value is less than €150 (£135). This has led to increased costs and bureaucracy for these companies, resulting in some refusing to ship to the UK. Additionally, international shipping companies like Federal Express and TNT have imposed additional charges on shipments between the UK and the EU to cover the costs of adjusting their systems to cope with Brexit.  Explanation and Rationale:  Differences Identification: 1. Output (a) includes more specific examples of companies affected by the tax changes (Dutch Bike Bits, Belgium-based Beer On Web, and Scandinavian Outdoor), while Output (b) only mentions Dutch Bike Bits and Belgium-based Beer On Web. 2. Output (a) provides more context about the reasons behind the tax changes, while Output (b) focuses on the direct impact of the changes on the retailers. 3. Output (a) mentions additional companies and their reactions to the tax changes (TNT, Federal Express, DHL, and UPS), while Output (b) only briefly mentions TNT and Federal Express.  Explanation and Rationale: The instruction asks for a summary of the measures retailer companies have taken to cope with Brexit. Both outputs provide information on the tax changes and the reactions of the companies. However, Output (b) is more concise and directly addresses the impact of the tax changes on the retailers, which is the main focus of the instruction. It also mentions the additional charges imposed by shipping companies, which is relevant to the overall context of the retailers coping with Brexit.  On the other hand, Output (a) includes more specific examples of companies and additional context about the tax changes, but this information is not as closely related to the main focus of the instruction. Additionally, Output (b) is more coherent and easier to read, as it stays focused on the main topic without going into too much detail.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (b) is better.

" He also included definitions of connive, a synonym of collude. An inquiry into the death of Billy Wright took issue with the emphasis on connivance and proposed a narrower definition of collusion, focusing on an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose. Nuala O'Loan, the first police ombudsman for Northern Ireland, adopted the definitions of Lord Stevens and Peter Cory to examine whether there had been collusion in the murder of Raymond McCord jnr. Al Hutchinson, O'Loan's successor, applied a less broad definition of collusion in his report on the attack on McGurk's Bar. In his review of the murder of Pat Finucane, Sir Christopher de Silva adopted a "working definition" of collusion that was less broad than Judge Cory's and more in line with the Billy Wright inquiry panel. Irish judge Peter Smithwick gave a similar definition of collusion to that of Peter Cory, emphasizing that it should also be considered in terms of an omission or failure to act.  # Output (b): The article talks about the various definitions of collusion given by different people. Sir John Stevens, the then Metropolitan Police Commissioner, defined collusion as actions ranging from the wilful failure to keep records to agents being involved in murder.

It provides the quantities of metals that can be extracted, which is directly related to the instruction's requirement. Additionally, it mentions the timeline for the potential issuance of licenses, which is relevant to understanding the potential of deep sea mining. The mention of the plan's goal to provide incentives for operators and ensure developing countries receive a share of the profits adds context to the potential benefits. While Output (b) touches on the environmental impact, it does not directly address the instruction's requirement and is less detailed in discussing the potential benefits of deep sea mining.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better. """
Differences Identification: 1. Output (a) mentions specific metals that can be extracted, including gold, copper, manganese, cobalt, and other metals, while Output (b) only mentions manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt. 2. Output (a) provides specific quantities of metals that can be extracted, while Output (b) does not mention any quantities. 3. Output (a) mentions the United Nations' International Seabed Authority and the sharing of proceeds with developing countries, while Output (b) does not mention these aspects.  Explanation and Rationale: Output (a) closely executes the instruction by summarizing the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It provides specific details about the estimated quantities of various metals, which is helpful for understanding the scale of the potential benefits. Additionally, it mentions the involvement of the United Nations' International Seabed Authority and the sharing of proceeds with developing countries, which adds context to the summary.  On the other hand, Output (b) does not mention specific quantities of metals that can be extracted, which is a crucial aspect of the potential benefits. It also does not mention the United Nations' International Seabed Authority or the sharing of proceeds, which are important aspects of the management of deep sea mining. While Output (b) does mention concerns about the environmental impact, these are not part of the summary requirement and can be addressed separately.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Differences Identification: 1. Output (a) mentions specific metals that can be extracted (gold, copper, manganese, cobalt, and other metals) and provides estimated quantities, while Output (b) only mentions manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt without providing estimated quantities.  Explanation and Rationale: The instruction asks for a summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. Output (a) closely executes the instruction by mentioning specific metals and providing estimated quantities, which gives a clearer understanding of the potential benefits of deep sea mining. On the other hand, Output (b) only mentions a few of the metals and does not provide any information on quantities, making it less informative and less precise in addressing the instruction.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.
or "Therefore, Output (b) is better." verbatim):  Differences Identification: 1. Output (a) mentions the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted, while Output (b) only mentions the types of metals. 2. Output (a) specifies the location of the assessment (eastern Pacific's Clarion-Clipperton Zone), while Output (b) does not mention the location. 3. Output (a) includes information about the United Nations' International Seabed Authority working on managing the extraction and sharing the proceeds with developing countries, while Output (b) only mentions the UN's plan for managing the extraction.  Explanation and Rationale: Output (a) provides a more detailed summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining by including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted, as well as specifying the location of the assessment. Additionally, Output (a) mentions the United Nations' International Seabed Authority's role in managing the extraction and sharing the proceeds with developing countries, which adds context to the summary. Output (b), on the other hand, only provides a brief overview of the potential benefits without including the specific quantities of metals or the United Nations' involvement in managing the extraction.  Final Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.
