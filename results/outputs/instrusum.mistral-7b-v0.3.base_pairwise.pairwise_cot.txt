The article provides a detailed account of the factors leading to the conflict between the Ethiopian government and forces in the Tigray region. Both outputs (a) and (b) attempt to summarize these factors, but Output (a) provides a more comprehensive and accurate summary.  Output (a) correctly identifies the power struggle, political reforms, and an election as key factors leading to the conflict. It also mentions the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) being sidelined by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, which is a crucial aspect of the conflict's origins. Furthermore, Output (a) explains the sequence of events leading to the conflict more accurately, such as the Tigray's defiance of the central government by holding its own regional election in September, which the central government deemed illegal, and the subsequent suspension of funding and cutting of ties between the two sides.  On the other hand, Output (b) omits several important factors and events, such as the power struggle, political reforms, and the election in Tigray. It also incorrectly states that the conflict started with the Tigrayan forces attacking a military base, when in fact, the conflict began with Abiy ordering a military offensive in response to the Tigrayan forces attacking a military base.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.

Therefore, Output (a) is better.
In this case, both outputs (a) and (b) provide a summary of Professor Suzuki's opinions, but they are not exactly the same. Output (a) accurately states that Professor Suzuki believes the number of thyroid cancer cases found in children after the Fukushima disaster is not related to the nuclear incident, and that the large-scale survey conducted in Japan has never been done before, leading to an increase in detected cases. It also correctly mentions that Prof. Suzuki and other experts think there will be very few or even zero extra childhood cancers due to Fukushima.  On the other hand, Output (b) contains some inaccuracies. It states that Professor Suzuki believes that the cases of thyroid cancer in Fukushima are not related to the nuclear disaster, and that the children of Fukushima are not at risk of developing cancer from the exposure to radiation. However, the article does not support this claim. While Professor Suzuki does say that the cases are not related to the nuclear disaster, he also explains that the increase in cases is due to the large-scale survey and the use of more sensitive equipment.
