While it mentions the general elements of collusion, it does not specify the key figures involved in providing the definitions, nor does it emphasize the importance of deliberate acts or omissions.  However, it is important to consider the purpose of the summary. If the goal is to provide a quick overview of the main points without delving into the specifics of who provided the definitions, Output (b) might be more suitable. It captures the essence of the definitions without overwhelming the reader with details.  Given the requirement to summarize the similarities of the definitions provided by different people, Output (a) is more appropriate as it directly addresses the key figures and their definitions. Therefore, Output (a) is better.

While Output (b) is informative and includes additional details, it is slightly more repetitive and less focused on the core similarities.  However, I would like to question the Scientist's argument regarding the inclusion of additional details in Output (b). The instruction asks for a summary of the similarities, and Output (b) does include additional details that are relevant to the core similarities. These details, such as the withholding of intelligence and evidence, the failure to keep records, and the failure to take action against known wrongdoing, are all part of the broader context of the definitions of collusion.
