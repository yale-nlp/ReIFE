Output (b) uses words like "recent raise," "small increase," and "manage expectations," which are more negative and dismissive. 3. Content: Output (a) congratulates the employee and acknowledges their hard work and contributions, while Output (b) only mentions the raise and implies that the employee's efforts were not significant enough to warrant a higher raise.  Explanation and Rationale: Output (a) better addresses the instruction by acknowledging the employee's impressive performance and expressing appreciation for their hard work. The tone is positive and supportive, which is more in line with the spirit of a passive-aggressive note. Output (b), on the other hand, has a dismissive and sarcastic tone, which is not appropriate for a passive-aggressive note.  Moreover, Output (a) provides a clear explanation of the raise, emphasizing the value the employee brings to the company and expressing confidence in their future contributions. Output (b), however, only mentions the raise in a dismissive manner and does not provide any context or explanation for the raise's size.  Therefore, Output (a) is better.
