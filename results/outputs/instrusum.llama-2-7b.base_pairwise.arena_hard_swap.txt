Therefore, Answer (a) is better.  Based on the information provided in the article, I found that Whisper and Secret are the two main apps that are focused on providing anonymity on the internet. Both apps have raised significant amounts of funding and have gained popularity among users. However, there are some concerns about the potential for users to be identified and for legal issues to arise.  Whisper, co-founded by Michael Heyward, allows users to post anonymous statements and has raised over $60m since its founding two years ago. The app uses a similar concept to a Catholic confession, where users can share their thoughts and feelings without being identified. This app seems to be more focused on providing a platform for users to share their personal thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment or reprisal.  On the other hand, Secret, founded by two former Google employees, Chrys Bader-Wechseler and David Byttow, accesses users' phone contacts and only shows them secrets from friends or friends of friends. This app seems to be more focused on providing a platform for users to share news and information without revealing their identities.  Breakr, founded by Dil-Domine Leonares, allows users to anonymously join chatrooms based on their location. This app seems to be more focused on providing a platform for users to connect with others in a specific location without revealing their identities.  Overall, both Whisper and Secret seem to be focused on providing a platform for users to share information and connect with others without revealing their identities. However, Whisper seems to be more focused on providing a platform for personal thoughts and feelings, while Secret seems to be more focused on providing a platform for news and information. Therefore, I believe that Whisper is the better app of the two.
Therefore, Answer (a) is better.  The article provides a comprehensive overview of various apps that offer anonymity on the internet. The summary highlights the key features of each app, including Whisper's ability to post anonymous statements and Secret's access to phone contacts to show Secrets from friends or friends of friends. The article also raises important questions about the promises of anonymity and the potential legal issues that could arise.  While Answer (b) provides some additional information about the increasing desire for anonymity on the internet and the potential legal issues surrounding it, the summary does not provide a clear and concise overview of the different apps mentioned in the article. Answer (a) provides a more detailed and organized summary of the information, making it easier to understand and compare the different apps.  In conclusion, Answer (a) provides a better summary of the information in the article due to its clear and concise organization, making it easier to understand and compare the different apps mentioned.
Therefore, Answer (a) is better.  Based on the information provided in the article, the two apps that stand out as offering the most significant level of anonymity are Whisper and Secret. Both of these apps allow users to post anonymous statements, and they have raised significant amounts of money since their inception. Whisper has raised over $60m since being founded two years ago, while Secret has raised $11.5m.  However, the article also highlights the limitations of these apps. For example, Whisper's reliance on users to download the app and post anonymous statements means that there is no guarantee of anonymity. Additionally, the article notes that promises of anonymity are essentially a marketing gimmick because if asked or required, the makers of these applications will hand over your information to law enforcement.  In contrast, Secret's access to users' phone contacts and show only Secrets from friends or friends of friends provides a higher level of anonymity. This is because it is more difficult for law enforcement or other third parties to identify users who are posting anonymous statements.  Overall, while both Whisper and Secret offer some level of anonymity, Secret's approach to accessing users' phone contacts and showing only Secrets from friends or friends of friends provides a higher level of anonymity and is therefore better.

Therefore, Answer (a) is better.  Both assistants provide a summary of the "One Ford Plan" and its implications for Ford's operations in the UK. However, Assistant A provides a more detailed and accurate summary of the plan and its impact on the Bridgend engine plant. Assistant A mentions that the plan led to a more challenging landscape for the plant, as it had to compete globally, and that the site is massive and it would become increasingly hard for local managers to argue the case that the plant makes economic sense to global Ford. This information is important and relevant to the user's prompt, as it highlights the challenges facing the Bridgend engine plant in the context of the "One Ford Plan."  On the other hand, Assistant B's summary is more general and lacks specific details about the impact of the "One Ford Plan" on the Bridgend engine plant.

Therefore, Answer (b) is better.  Both assistants provided a summary of the "One Ford Plan" and its implications for Ford's operations in the UK. However, Assistant B provided a more detailed and nuanced explanation of the plan and its impact on Ford's operations in the country.  Assistant B noted that the "One Ford Plan" was a decision made in 2008 to centralize Ford's operations, creating a global company with the same models selling worldwide and investments going to the most efficient plants.

Therefore, Answer (a) is better.  In this article, several individuals provided their definitions of collusion, and I evaluated each definition based on the given requirement. The definitions provided by Sir John Stevens, Peter Cory, Nuala O'Loan, Al Hutchinson, and Peter Smithwick all cover the key aspects of collusion, including agreement, intent, and concealment. However, upon closer analysis, I found that Stevens' and Cory's definitions are more comprehensive and better capture the essence of collusion.  Stevens' definition encompasses a wide range of actions and omissions, from the wilful failure to keep records to the extreme of agents being involved in murder. This broad definition allows for a more nuanced understanding of collusion, recognizing that it can take many forms and can be perpetrated through various means. Cory's definition, on the other hand, highlights the importance of secrecy and understanding in collusion, emphasizing that it involves an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose.  In contrast, the definitions provided by O'Loan, Hutchinson, and Smithwick are less comprehensive and focus more on specific aspects of collusion, such as the requirement of deliberate ignorance or inaction. While these definitions are useful in certain contexts, they do not fully capture the complexity and scope of collusion as defined by Stevens and Cory.  Therefore, based on the given requirement and the definitions provided in the article, I conclude that Answer (a) is better, as it provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of collusion.
Therefore, Answer (a) is better.  In this article, several individuals provided their definitions of collusion, and I evaluated each definition based on the given requirement. Sir John Stevens, Peter Cory, Nuala O'Loan, Al Hutchinson, and Peter Smithwick are the people who gave their definitions of collusion in the article. Each definition provided by these individuals is comprehensive and covers various aspects of collusion.  Sir John Stevens' definition of collusion is broad and covers a wide range of actions, including the wilful failure to keep records, the absence of accountability, the withholding of intelligence and evidence, and the extreme of agents being involved in murder. This definition is inclusive and captures the essence of collusion.  Peter Cory's definition of collusion is also comprehensive and highlights the importance of having a secret understanding. He emphasizes that connivance is a synonym of the verb collude and includes definitions such as "to deliberately ignore" and "to turn a blind eye." This definition is detailed and provides a clear understanding of the term collusion.  Nuala O'Loan adopted the definitions of Lord Stevens and Peter Cory, concluding that there had been collusion in the murder of Raymond McCord jnr. Her definition is similar to that of Stevens and Cory, and she emphasizes the importance of accountability and the withholding of intelligence and evidence.  Al Hutchinson applied a less broad definition of collusion in his report on the attack on McGurk's Bar. He emphasizes that the essence of collusion requires that a number of elements be present, including an agreement between two or more parties and evidence that the act or omission complained of was deliberate. This definition is more specific and focuses on the intentional actions of individuals or organizations.  Peter Smithwick gave a similar definition of collusion to that of Peter Cory, stating that it generally means the commission of an act but can also involve an omission or failure to act. This definition is inclusive and covers both active and passive forms of collusion.  After evaluating each definition provided by these individuals, I conclude that Sir John Stevens' definition is the most comprehensive and inclusive. It covers a wide range of actions and emphasizes the importance of accountability and the withholding of intelligence and evidence. Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
Therefore, Answer (a) is better.  The definitions of collusion provided in the article are generally consistent with each other, with most of them focusing on the idea of an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose. These definitions also highlight the importance of deliberate actions or omissions in determining whether collusion has occurred.  Answer (a) effectively summarizes these definitions and highlights their key elements. It emphasizes that collusion involves both positive actions and deliberate omissions, and that both should be considered when determining whether collusion has occurred. This is a comprehensive and accurate summary of the definitions provided in the article.  Answer (b), on the other hand, provides a more detailed list of the different definitions of collusion proposed by different people in the article. While this answer is more thorough in its examination of the various definitions, it does not provide a clear and concise summary of the key elements of collusion as Answer (a) does.  Therefore, based on the requirements of the prompt and the quality of the answers provided, I conclude that Answer (a) is better.
Therefore, Answer (b) is better.  Both Answer (a) and Answer (b) provide similar definitions of collusion, emphasizing an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose, and the deliberate ignoring or turning a blind eye to a known wrongdoing or misbehavior. However, Answer (b) provides a more comprehensive and nuanced definition of collusion, acknowledging that it may also involve deliberate omissions or failures to act, rather than just positive acts.  Furthermore, Answer (b) highlights the importance of considering both active and passive forms of collusion, recognizing that the latter can be just as harmful as the former. This broader definition of collusion is more in line with the findings of many investigations into paramilitary gangs, security forces, and intelligence agencies in Northern Ireland, which have consistently shown that collusion was a widespread and systemic problem.  In contrast, Answer (a) seems to be more focused on the idea of an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations, and may not fully capture the complexity and scope of collusion in certain contexts. While it is true that some definitions of collusion emphasize the importance of an agreement or understanding, it is equally important to recognize that collusion can also involve deliberate omissions or failures to act, as well as a culture of impunity and complicity that allows such behavior to persist.  In conclusion, while both Answer (a) and Answer (b) provide useful definitions of collusion, I believe that Answer (b) is more comprehensive and accurate, and better captures the complexities and nuances of this concept. Therefore, I conclude that Answer (b) is better.
Therefore, Answer (b) is better.  The definitions of collusion provided by different people in the article share several similarities, including the presence of secret agreements or arrangements between individuals or organizations to achieve unlawful or improper purposes, the act of deliberately ignoring or turning a blind eye to wrongful acts, and the consideration of both active acts and omissions or failures to act as forms of collusion. These similarities suggest that the definitions are reasonably broad and encompass a range of behaviors and actions that could be considered collusion.  In contrast, some of the definitions provided are more narrow and focused on specific aspects of collusion, such as the use of the verb "connive" or the withholding of intelligence and evidence. While these definitions may be useful in certain contexts, they do not capture the full range of behaviors and actions that could be considered collusion.  Overall, the definitions of collusion provided in the article are complex and multifaceted, and there is no single definition that fully captures the concept. However, the definitions provided in Answer (b) are more comprehensive and encompass a broader range of behaviors and actions that could be considered collusion. Therefore, Answer (b) is better.
