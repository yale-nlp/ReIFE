Answer (b) is more general and focuses on the potential benefits of deep sea mining in general, without providing specific details. Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
After evaluating both answers, I find that Answer (a) is better. Answer (a) provides a more comprehensive summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It also mentions the role of the United Nations' International Seabed Authority in managing the extraction of these nodules and sharing the proceeds with developing countries. Answer (b) is less specific and does not provide any information about the quantities of metals that can be extracted or the role of the International Seabed Authority. Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
After evaluating both answers, I find that Answer (a) is better. Answer (a) provides a more concise and relevant summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It directly addresses the given requirement and provides specific information from the article.  Answer (b), on the other hand, is less concise and does not provide specific information about the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It focuses more on the potential environmental impact of deep sea mining, which is not the main focus of the given requirement.  Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
Both answers (a) and (b) provide a good summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. However, answer (a) is more concise and clear in its presentation of the information, making it easier for the reader to understand the main points. Answer (b) is also helpful and relevant, but it is slightly less concise and could be improved by removing some unnecessary repetition. Therefore, Answer (a) is better.
