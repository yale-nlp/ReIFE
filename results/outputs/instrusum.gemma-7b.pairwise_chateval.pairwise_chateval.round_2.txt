General Public: **Evaluation:**    The option of building more properties on green belt land is a controversial solution to London's housing crisis.

In Output (a), the author clearly states Bardon's stance against abortion and the basis for his position. He emphasizes the safetyguarded lives of sick pregnant women in Malta and argues that the child should not be sacrificed, even in cases of rape. While he acknowledges the tragedy of rape and the need to protect victims, he emphasizes the controversial nature of abortion and the society's stance against killing a child.    In contrast, Output (b) focuses primarily on the legal aspects of abortion in Malta and does not delve into Bardon's personal views as clearly. It mentions the "double effect" law and the potential consequences for pregnant women who seek abortions abroad. While it does touch upon the issue of rape, it does not delve deeply into Bardon's argument against abortion in such cases.    Therefore, I believe that Output (a) is better as it more effectively summarizes Bardon's stance against abortion and provides a more comprehensive overview of the issue, including his personal views and the broader societal context.

General Public: **Evaluation:**    Output (a) is better. Quantum computers have the potential to solve complex computational problems much faster than conventional computers due to the unique properties of qubits. Qubits can be in two states at the same time, allowing for a vast number of calculations to be performed simultaneously. Additionally, qubits can influence each other even when they're not physically connected, giving them the ability to make logical leaps that conventional computers cannot. However, the challenge is the fragility of quantum itself, as qubits are highly unstable and prone to interference.

General Public: **Evaluation:**    The definitions of collusion provided by different people in the article share several similarities. These include the presence of secret agreements or arrangements between individuals or organizations to achieve unlawful or improper purposes, the act of deliberately ignoring or turning a blind eye to wrongful acts, and the consideration of both active acts and omissions or failures to act as forms of collusion.    However, there are some minor differences between the definitions. For example, some definitions include the withholding of intelligence and evidence as a form of collusion, while others do not. Similarly, some definitions include the failure to keep records or to take action against a known wrongdoing as a form of collusion, while others do not.
