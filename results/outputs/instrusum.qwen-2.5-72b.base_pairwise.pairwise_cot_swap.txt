Output (a), while mentioning the potential for extracting large quantities of metals, does not provide specific figures and also includes information about the environmental impact, which is not part of the summary requirement. Therefore, Output (b) is better.
Output (a) provides a more detailed and specific summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It also mentions the eastern Pacific as a specific area with a high concentration of these resources. Output (b) is more general and does not provide the same level of detail. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Output (a) provides a more detailed and specific summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It also mentions the role of the United Nations' International Seabed Authority in managing the extraction and sharing the proceeds with developing countries. Output (b) is more general and does not provide the specific quantities of metals that can be extracted. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Output (a) provides a more detailed and specific summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It directly addresses the summary requirement by mentioning the specific assessment of the eastern Pacific's Clarion-Clipperton Zone and the estimated quantities of metals. Output (b), while mentioning the potential for extracting valuable metals, does not provide the specific details required by the instruction. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
Both outputs provide a summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. However, Output (a) is more precise in mentioning the specific area, the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, and the role of the International Seabed Authority in managing the extraction and sharing the proceeds with developing countries. Output (b) does not mention the specific area or the role of the International Seabed Authority. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
