Overall, Output (b) is the more complete and helpful response, meeting all the key instructions and constraints provided by the user.
After evaluating both outputs based on the aspects provided, I conclude that Output (a) is better. The output is concise, efficient, and follows all the instructions provided. It uses the datetime module to create a date object and then accesses the day of the week using the weekday() method. This approach is accurate, efficient, and meets all the criteria provided. Additionally, Output (a) is more informative and user-friendly, as it directly prints the day of the week without any additional processing.  Output (b) is also a valid solution, but it is less efficient and does not follow all the instructions provided. The function uses multiple if-else statements to determine the day of the week based on the day number, which is less efficient than the datetime module used in Output (a). Additionally, the function does not directly answer the question as asked and does not follow the output format specified by the user.  In conclusion, Output (a) is more accurate, efficient, and informative than Output (b), and it follows all the instructions provided. Therefore, I conclude that Output (a) is better.
