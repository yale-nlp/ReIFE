Therefore, Output (a) is better. Output (a) demonstrates a higher level of text quality, with better organization, fluency, and coherence. It also provides significantly more information and accuracy, addressing the user's intention more effectively. Output (a) fully follows the instruction by providing a comprehensive analysis of how life stages shape our understanding of time and mortality, while Output (b) is brief and lacks detail, making it less informative and complete.
Therefore, Output (b) is better.  Output (b) is more accurate in its calculation of the probability, which is a critical aspect of the given instruction. While Output (a) provides a more detailed explanation and lists all possible outcomes, its conclusion regarding the probability being certain (1) is incorrect due to the oversight of the single outcome (1,1) that results in a total of 2. Output (b) correctly computes the probability as approximately 97.22%, adhering to the principles of probability. In this context, accuracy in the probability calculation outweighs the additional detail in Output (a), making Output (b) the better choice overall.
Therefore, Output (a) is better.  Output (a) provides a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of the key components and considerations for a solar-powered water heating system, making it more informative and suitable for someone seeking a thorough understanding of the topic.
