The statements are also well-structured and easy to understand.  On the other hand, Output (b) contains some inaccuracies and omissions. For example, the statement "The average cat has ten lives" is a myth with no scientific basis, and "Cats purr to communicate with each other" is not entirely accurate, as purring can also be a sign of relaxation or self-soothing. Additionally, the statement "Cats have a reputation for being aggressive, but in reality they are much more likely to flee than fight" is not a fact about cats but rather a generalization about their behavior.  Therefore, Output (a) is better. It provides a complete, accurate, and relevant response to the user's question, meeting all the key instructions and explicit constraints provided by the user.
