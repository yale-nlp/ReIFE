Output (b) also provides accurate information, but it lacks the specificity and detail of Output (a).  5. Completeness of Instruction Following: The instruction requires a summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. Output (a) provides a complete and accurate summary of this information, while Output (b) provides a more general overview that lacks the specific details requested in the instruction.  Overall, Output (a) provides a more detailed and accurate summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. Output (a) also follows the instruction more closely and provides a clearer and more concise summary of the information requested. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
1. Text Quality: Output (a) is well-structured and easy to read, with a clear and concise summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining. Output (b) is also well-written, but it includes a few extra sentences that are not directly related to the summary requirement, which slightly detracts from its overall quality.  2. Information Richness: Output (b) provides more information than Output (a), including the fact that the United Nations has published its first plan for managing the extraction of minerals and that companies could apply for licences from as soon as 2016. However, Output (a) still provides a clear and concise summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted.  3. User Intention Inference: Neither Output (a) nor Output (b) requires any inference of the user's intention, as the summary requirement is clearly stated.  4. Accuracy: Both Output (a) and Output (b) accurately summarize the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted.  5. Completeness of Instruction Following: Both Output (a) and Output (b) follow the instruction to summarize the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. However, Output (b) includes a few extra sentences that are not directly related to the summary requirement, which slightly detracts from its completeness.  Overall, while both outputs are well-written and accurate, Output (a) is slightly more concise and focused on the summary requirement, making it a better choice. Therefore, Output (a) is better.
