Therefore, Output (a) is better.|||General Public:Output (a) is better because it precisely executes the instruction by finding common elements in two arrays without using any extra data structures. It employs a generator function with two pointers, which is an efficient approach that doesn't require storing the common elements in a list. In contrast, Output (b) uses a list to store common elements and modifies the second array, violating the instruction's requirement. Therefore, Output (a) is better.|||Scientist:As a Scientist, I evaluate the two outputs based on their adherence to the instruction and their efficiency. Output (a) implements a program that finds common elements in two arrays without using extra data structures by utilizing a generator function with two pointers. This approach effectively compares elements from both arrays and yields common elements on the fly, thus conserving memory and precisely executing the instruction.  On the other hand, Output (b) employs a nested loop and a list to store common elements.
