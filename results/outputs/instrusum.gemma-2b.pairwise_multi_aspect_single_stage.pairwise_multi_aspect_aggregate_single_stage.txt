**Output (a) is better.**    The article clearly demonstrates that the Puritans were not as opposed to alcohol as many people believe. They saw it as a good creature of God and allowed its consumption in moderation. However, by the early 1800s, alcoholism was becoming a serious problem in America, leading to Prohibition in 1917. The cost of enforcement eventually became prohibitive, and in 1933, Prohibition was ended. Since then, America has had a mishmash of local, state, and federal controls on alcohol.
