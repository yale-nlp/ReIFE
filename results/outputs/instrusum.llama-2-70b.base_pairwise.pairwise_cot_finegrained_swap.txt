could destabilise the region. The United Nations has called for restraint. The African Union has urged both sides to negotiate. The European Union has expressed its "deep concern". The United States has urged "all parties to avoid further violence and to pursue peaceful resolution". The UK has called for "an immediate end to hostilities". The conflict in Ethiopia is a complex one, with deep historical, political and ethnic roots. It will take more than a ceasefire to resolve it.  Output (a): The conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region is a complex one, with deep historical, political, and ethnic roots. The current crisis began on November 4, when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray. This move was prompted by an attack on a military base housing government troops in Tigray. The conflict has escalated, with both sides accusing each other of aggression. The roots of this crisis can be traced back to Ethiopia's system of government, which has been in place since 1994. The system is based on a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) was a dominant political party in the coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991. However, the party was sidelined by Prime Minister Abiy, who took office in 2018 after anti-government protests. The TPLF has resisted the prime minister's reforms, which they see as an attempt to centralize power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system. The conflict has caused significant displacement and loss of life, with reports of a civilian massacre. The international community has called for restraint and negotiations. The conflict in Ethiopia is a complex one, and it will take more than a ceasefire to resolve it.

10% of smallholder farmers have any kind of certificate documenting their ownership rights. Nearly two-thirds of the rural population in sub-Saharan Africa live on less than $1.25 a day. 80% of traditional chiefs are interested in Landmapp's service. Freshmarte's app is currently being trialled in southern Nigeria by British American Tobacco, and goes live country-wide in November. WeFarm's algorithm routes questions to the most relevant farmers, based on their location and expertise. Each farmer receives on average three to five answers within a couple of hours. Farmers from other countries begin sending in advice within 24 hours. Rural farmers typically rely on government field officers for assistance if they have a problem with their crops or livestock. Visits to rural villages from these officers are often only once a month. Kenny Ewan, WeFarm's founder and chief executive, says that technology opens up lots of opportunities for smallholders. Ross Baird, chief executive of investment and business training organisation, Village Capital, says that improving farmers' access to financial services - and financial security - also needs to be a priority for technical innovation. Village Capital recently ran a business accelerator in East Africa focusing on these challenges. He says Africa needs better infrastructure, and preferably free internet, if farmers are to benefit fully from new technology.  Differences Identification: 1.

Fermi Paradox. Some scientists argue that the window of opportunity for similar technology is incredibly small, while others suggest that intelligence may lead to self-destruction. The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the conditions for life on Earth are unique, making intelligent life rare. Dr. Drake believes that we just haven't looked hard enough yet. The article also mentions the possibility of humans living in a computer simulation created by superior beings.
. The Fermi Paradox, posed by physicist Enrico Fermi in 1950, juxtaposes the high estimates of intelligent life and the lack of evidence put forward. The article also mentions the Rare Earth hypothesis, which argues that the conditions that allow for life on Earth are so unique that intelligent life is unlikely to exist elsewhere.

The article also mentions the Fermi Paradox, which asks why we haven't found any evidence of alien life if there are so many civilizations out there. Some scientists suggest that the window of opportunity for communication is very small, as civilizations may not have the same technology as us, or they may be too far away. Others suggest that intelligent life may be rare in the universe, or that we are just not looking for it in the right way. Dr. Drake, a pioneer in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, suggests that we need to keep looking and that we might find evidence of alien life eventually.

ways to level the playing field for women in the workplace.  And here are two AI chatbot outputs:  Output (a): There are several ways to level the playing field for women in the workplace, including enforcing paternity leave, subsidizing childcare, allowing babies in the office, letting parents work from home, and giving women a pay rise. Enforcing paternity leave ensures that men take time off work to cover childcare, allowing women to return to work and earn more money. Subsidizing childcare can help low-income families afford childcare costs, making it easier for mothers to work. Allowing babies in the office can help mothers balance work and family responsibilities. Letting parents work from home can also help reduce the burden of childcare and allow parents to work more flexibly. Finally, giving women a pay rise can help close the gender pay gap.  Output (b): To level the playing field for women in the workplace, several steps can be taken. Firstly, paternity leave should be enforced to encourage men to take on childcare responsibilities, allowing women to return to work and earn a higher income. Secondly, childcare costs should be subsidized to help low-income families afford quality childcare, making it easier for mothers to work. Thirdly, babies should be allowed in the office to help mothers balance work and family responsibilities.

pools. United Utilities, one of the UK's largest water companies, is in the process of rolling out 102,000 sensors across its network in the north west of England. The firm has installed 46,000 already, covering 10% of its pipe network. The sensors use accelerometers and acoustic loggers to detect leaks. United Utilities is working with Fido Tech to refine an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can pick out leaks with more than 90% accuracy. The system uses thousands of recordings to identify leaks. Southern Water is rolling out 700 NB-IoT acoustic logger sensors around its network in Southampton. The sensors record audio from a pipe and transmit it to a central system. The system calculates the position of the leak based on the speed at which sound travels through the pipe's material. SES Water is upgrading its sensors to use NB-IoT so that data from them can be transmitted every 15 minutes rather than once per hour. The system is due to be launched later this year.

The United States has urged "all parties to avoid further violence and to pursue peaceful resolution". The UK has called for "an immediate end to hostilities". The conflict in Ethiopia is a complex one, with deep historical, political and ethnic roots. It will take more than a ceasefire to resolve it.  Output (a): The conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region is a complex one, with deep historical, political, and ethnic roots. The current crisis began on November 4, when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray. This move was prompted by an attack on a military base housing government troops in Tigray. The conflict has escalated, with both sides accusing each other of aggression. The roots of this crisis can be traced back to Ethiopia's system of government, which has been in place since 1994. The system is based on a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) was a dominant political party in the coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991. However, the party was sidelined by Prime Minister Abiy, who took office in 2018 after anti-government protests. The TPLF has resisted the prime minister's reforms, which they see as an attempt to centralize power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system. The conflict has caused significant displacement and loss of life, with reports of a civilian massacre. The international community has called for restraint and negotiations.

Output (a): The conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region is a complex one, with deep historical, political, and ethnic roots. The current crisis began on November 4, when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray. This move was prompted by an attack on a military base housing government troops in Tigray. The conflict has escalated, with both sides accusing each other of aggression. The roots of this crisis can be traced back to Ethiopia's system of government, which has been in place since 1994. The system is based on a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) was a dominant political party in the coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991. However, the party was sidelined by Prime Minister Abiy, who took office in 2018 after anti-government protests. The TPLF has resisted the prime minister's reforms, which they see as an attempt to centralize power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system. The conflict has caused significant displacement and loss of life, with reports of a civilian massacre. The international community has called for restraint and negotiations.

with the average person drinking 5.8 gallons of pure alcohol per year. This was largely due to the fact that alcohol was integrated into daily life and was seen as a good creature of God. However, as time went on, attitudes towards alcohol began to change. In 1830, consumption peaked at 7.1 gallons per year, and drinking became a moral issue. The temperance movement gained popularity, and ultimately led to Prohibition in 1919. During this time, many famous figures emerged, including Al Capone. However, after Prohibition was repealed in 1933, alcohol consumption did not return to its previous levels. Today, Americans consume an average of 2.3 gallons of pure alcohol per year, a significant decrease from the early days of America.  # Output (a): The history of alcohol consumption in America has been a tumultuous one.

apps that offer anonymity to users, such as Secret, Whisper, and Breakr. Secret and Whisper allow users to post anonymous statements, while Breakr allows users to join anonymous chatrooms based on their location. The founders of these apps argue that they offer a way for people to express themselves without fear of reprisal, and that they can help train people in empathy. However, technologist Runi Sandvik notes that promises of anonymity are often a marketing gimmick, as apps can still hand over user information to law enforcement if required. University of Maryland law professor James Grimmelman also notes that apps that promise anonymity can get into legal issues, such as leaking trade secrets.

possible solution to London's housing crisis is to build more properties on green belt lands.

measures to ensure safe tourism, such as limiting opening times and conditions in pubs and clubs, and banning nightclubs in certain areas. The pandemic has accelerated a shift towards less nightlife and more daytime experiences, and the government is promoting a move upmarket, focusing on quality tourism rather than mass tourism. The industry leaders recognize that Covid-19 may make crowding a taboo for all future visitors, and technology can be used to control numbers and improve hygiene in all hospitality areas. However, not everyone is supportive of the return of tourists, as the sector has transformed the archipelago's landscape, creating low-paid and seasonal employment, and driving the population towards unsustainability and environmental collapse. The future of tourism in the Balearic Islands is uncertain, as the industry is vulnerable to instability and the working class and small businesses are benefiting less from it.  # Output (a): The Balearic Islands are facing a critical moment in their tourism industry due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

UK have reached high levels, with parts of north-west Norfolk hitting level 10 on the Department of the Environment's one-to-10 scale. The rest of the country is also experiencing high levels of pollution, with London, the Midlands, and Yorkshire and Humberside reaching pollution levels of five. The pollution is caused by a combination of factors, including dust from storms in the Sahara, industrial pollution from Europe, and residential emissions. The World Health Organization (WHO) uses PM10 levels to measure pollution, and the UK is currently exceeding the safe limit for air pollution. The EU is taking legal action against the UK for persistently over the safe limit for air pollution, particularly levels of nitrogen dioxide. Air pollution is a serious problem, responsible for seven million premature deaths a year around the world, and the UK is not alone in struggling with air quality issues.

is severe, with parts of England reaching high levels of pollution, exceeding the safe limit for air pollution, and breaching WHO recommended limits. The pollution is caused by various substances, including nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ammonia, which form particles in the atmosphere. The two most common measurements are particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometres or less (PM2.5) and larger particles measuring 10 micrometres (PM10). The WHO recommends mean exposure over 24 hours to PM2.5 of no more than 10 micrograms/m3, and to PM10 of no more than 25. The UK is not alone in its air pollution struggles, as most EU countries also have serious air quality problems. The EU is taking legal action against the UK for persistently over the safe limit for air pollution, particularly levels of nitrogen dioxide. Diesel vehicles are a major contributor to the UK's pollution woes, producing a lot of nitrogen dioxide. Air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths a year around the world, and 30,000 people in the UK die prematurely every year from problems associated with air pollution. The UK's air quality still routinely breaches WHO recommended limits, even at times of lower pollution.  Therefore, Output (b) is better.

) Quantum computers have the potential to solve complex computational problems much faster than conventional computers. They can be used for various applications such as drug discovery, cryptography, material design, climate modeling, and artificial intelligence. Quantum computers use qubits, which can be in multiple states at once, allowing them to perform multiple calculations simultaneously. This can lead to exponential increases in computing power. Additionally, qubits can influence each other even when they are not physically connected, allowing for logical leaps that conventional computers cannot make. However, qubits are highly unstable and prone to errors, so the race is on to find a way to stabilize them for mass production.  # Output (a) Quantum computers have the potential to solve complex computational problems much faster than conventional computers.

schools should be teaching. - The biggest changes are likely to be in secondary schools where subjects will be incorporated into six "areas of learning and experience". - The curriculum sets out "what matters" and "progression steps" for each learning area. - The six areas of learning and experience are: 1. Maths and numeracy, 2. Languages, literacy and communication, 3. Health and well-being, 4. Humanities, 5. Science and technology, and 6. Expressive arts. - Education Minister Kirsty Williams said she expected to publish the curriculum's implementation plan after Easter. - An extra inset training day has been introduced this academic year and for the next two years to help schools prepare, along with £39m for training teachers. - The only mandatory subjects in the curriculum are: Head teachers and nurseries will have discretion over how much English children learn up to the age of seven after Welsh language campaigners and unions raised concerns about a previous plan to make English compulsory in Welsh-medium nurseries. - There will still be annual national reading and numeracy tests for seven to 14-year-olds. - Watchdog Qualifications Wales is consulting on "reshaping qualifications to complement the new curriculum" until February 7, and there are major questions about how exams at 16 will work in the context of the broader sort of education the new curriculum is meant to introduce. - One of the "pioneer schools" which has been trialing ideas for the new curriculum is Maesteg School. - Penny Pearson, a trained art teacher, is working on a project that incorporates creative writing, music, and art, such as creating a wound using clay and paints. - Eleven-year-old Harvey explained how they had been using flour, jelly and food coloring to create bite marks on their arms. - Evan, also aged 11, particularly enjoyed creating music to "defeat" the zombies. - Head teacher Helen Jones is enthusiastic about the new curriculum and the chance to experiment with new ways of teaching, but said she was aware of the need to get pupils ready for their GCSE exams. - Sheridan Edwards, a parent of four children, provisionally liked the sound of the reforms based on the experience of her older son and daughter. - Ms. Edwards thought the reforms could make school more fun and inviting and help children with subjects they were less interested in. - Ms. Edwards said she was "all for" getting children ready for real life after school. - Is there anything you would like to know about the new curriculum?

political consultant, said Mr Ignatieff had to seize the opportunity in the debates to demonstrate that he has leadership qualities and to use the auditor general's report as a "springboard" to raise questions in voters' minds about the Conservatives' honesty and spending. "He needs to show a broader performance, a deeper knowledge of the issues, maybe deliver some soaring rhetoric," Mr Bonner said.  John Ivison, a National Post political columnist, said the Liberals were trying to take advantage of the crowded and divided opposition to attract leftist New Democrat voters. "Their platform is becoming virtually identical to the NDP's," he said. "There's a lot of promises of money for childcare, family care and post-secondary education - all the things NDP voters care about."  Rex Murphy, one of Canada's best known TV and radio political commentators, said the election had been fought over trivial matters rather than substantive issues - the format of the debate and Mr Ignatieff's political style, for example, rather than the global economy, Japan, Libya and energy policy.

Please compare the following two outputs:  Output (a): The number of UK fire and rescue staff taking long-term sick leave due to mental illness has risen by nearly a third over the last six years, figures show.  Output (b): The number of UK fire and rescue staff taking long-term sick leave due to mental illness has risen by nearly a third over the last six years, figures show. By George Greenwood and Laura Harmes 5 live Investigates In London, the figure has doubled since 2011-12. Some 103 London fire staff have taken mental health leave this year, some after working at Grenfell Tower. The Home Office said it was the responsibility of fire services to put wellbeing services in place. Two-thirds of fire services provided data following a Freedom of Information request submitted by 5 live Investigates. They reveal the number of firefighters and other staff taking long-term mental health leave rose from 600 to 780 over the last six years. At least 126 staff have left the service due to mental health issues since 2011. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service only provided comparable figures for one full year. In 2016-17, 97 Scottish fire staff took long-term mental health sick leave while in Northern Ireland that figure was 111. Andy Graham, 52, is a former firefighter, who served in the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. He has suffered from PTSD for the last 30 years. Mr. Graham, who has a son and a daughter, retired last year and now trains others in mental health first aid. "When I started in the fire service in 1987 there was no proper debriefing system in place," he explained. "The first fatal incident I attended was a particularly traumatic suicide. "Within a matter of weeks, I started suffering from nightmares and panic attacks, and it snowballed from there, after attending more fatal incidents." He said that he was afraid to go to bed at night because of the nightmares. "It meant I started staying up late, drinking alcohol to help me sleep. "Through the daytime, there would be triggers that would set me off having flashbacks and panic attacks. Those triggers were blue lights, sirens, loud bangs. Seeing certain situations being depicted on TV even would set me off." Suppressed issues His son, John, was only five when his father had a breakdown. "It's horrible to bring it back, being so young and coming through the front door and seeing your dad lying on the couch with a blank look on his face, someone that you're so used to being bubbly and happy, and he doesn't even say hello to you." Andy explained that he tried to keep a lid on his issues for years. "But they were always there, bubbling under the surface. When you're in the fire service, you're told that you're the strong one, the one there to help others. "So it goes really against the grain to be asking for help. "I've been in therapy four times now, and I'm in a better place than I have been for 29 years. "Fire services have better debriefing systems than they used to, but the support is not where it needs to be yet." Richard Welch, London Fire Brigade commander for Lambeth said that following the incident at Grenfell Tower, 200 of their staff have received counseling - and that 80 were still seeing counselors. Sean Starbuck, mental health lead for the Fire Brigades Union said: "The stigma attached to mental health needs to be consigned to the bins of history where it belongs. It's not going to get there on its own. "Fire services need to create an environment where firefighters feel able to disclose if they are suffering as a result of traumatic scenes they witness as part of the job. "At the moment it appears many are unable to." Faye McGuinness, program manager for mental health charity Mind's Blue Light program, said: "Our survey of over 1,600 staff and volunteers across emergency services shows nearly nine in 10 have experienced stress, low mood or poor mental health while working in their current role. "A shocking one in four told us that they had contemplated taking their own lives. "Not everyone involved in a traumatic event will develop post-traumatic stress disorder. It can take a long time - sometimes years - for symptoms to emerge." Fire service responsibility A Home Office spokesperson said: "It is the responsibility of fire and rescue services to have wellbeing services in place that meet their workforce needs. "The government has provided an additional £1.5m to pay for mental health support through Mind's Blue Light Programme to ensure our emergency services workers have the counseling and emotional support they require." Ann Millington of the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said the increase could reflect a change in behavior with more firefighters prepared to seek assistance. She said fire and rescue services had put a lot of work into ensuring help and support are available to staff and they were working hard to reduce the stigma around mental health issues. She added: "The days following the Grenfell fire saw a lot of open discussion about support being made available to firefighters and firefighters openly discussing it. The fact that people were talking about it openly and willing to accept help is an encouraging sign for the wider fire sector." A spokesperson for the London Fire Brigade said: "The welfare of staff is of paramount importance to the brigade. Our counseling and wellbeing service provides accredited counseling to all staff to help with their psychological wellbeing. "Firefighters can and do see some traumatizing things and it is important to give them the support they need and for them to know that there are always people available to listen to them. "Seeing an increase in the number of people coming forward because they need help is positive, as rather than suppressing their feelings, staff want to seek help and use the services available to them." The service says that of the 103 staff members identified in 5 live's FOI figures, five were as a result of the Grenfell Tower disaster. All of these staff members are continuing to receive occupational health and counseling support. 5 live Investigates: Firefighter Mental Health is broadcast on BBC Radio 5 live on Sunday, 17 September at 11:00 BST.

"Seeing an increase in the number of people coming forward because they need help is positive, as rather than suppressing their feelings, staff want to seek help and use the services available to them." The service says that of the 103 staff members identified in 5 live's FOI figures, five were as a result of the Grenfell Tower disaster. All of these staff members are continuing to receive occupational health and counseling support. 5 live Investigates: Firefighter Mental Health is broadcast on BBC Radio 5 live on Sunday, 17 September at 11:00 BST.

By George Greenwood and Laura Harmes 5 live Investigates In London, the figure has doubled since 2011-12. Some 103 London fire staff have taken mental health leave this year, some after working at Grenfell Tower. The Home Office said it was the responsibility of fire services to put wellbeing services in place. Two-thirds of fire services provided data following a Freedom of Information request submitted by 5 live Investigates. They reveal the number of firefighters and other staff taking long-term mental health leave rose from 600 to 780 over the last six years. At least 126 staff have left the service due to mental health issues since 2011. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service only provided comparable figures for one full year. In 2016-17, 97 Scottish fire staff took long-term mental health sick leave while in Northern Ireland that figure was 111. Andy Graham, 52, is a former firefighter, who served in the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. He has suffered from PTSD for the last 30 years. Mr. Graham, who has a son and a daughter, retired last year and now trains others in mental health first aid. "When I started in the fire service in 1987 there was no proper debriefing system in place," he explained. "The first fatal incident I attended was a particularly traumatic suicide. "Within a matter of weeks, I started suffering from nightmares and panic attacks, and it snowballed from there, after attending more fatal incidents." He said that he was afraid to go to bed at night because of the nightmares. "It meant I started staying up late, drinking alcohol to help me sleep. "Through the daytime, there would be triggers that would set me off having flashbacks and panic attacks. Those triggers were blue lights, sirens, loud bangs. Seeing certain situations being depicted on TV even would set me off." Suppressed issues His son, John, was only five when his father had a breakdown. "It's horrible to bring it back, being so young and coming through the front door and seeing your dad lying on the couch with a blank look on his face, someone that you're so used to being bubbly and happy, and he doesn't even say hello to you." Andy explained that he tried to keep a lid on his issues for years. "But they were always there, bubbling under the surface. When you're in the fire service, you're told that you're the strong one, the one there to help others. "So it goes really against the grain to be asking for help. "I've been in therapy four times now, and I'm in a better place than I have been for 29 years. "Fire services have better debriefing systems than they used to, but the support is not where it needs to be yet." Richard Welch, London Fire Brigade commander for Lambeth said that following the incident at Grenfell Tower, 200 of their staff have received counseling - and that 80 were still seeing counselors. Sean Starbuck, mental health lead for the Fire Brigades Union said: "The stigma attached to mental health needs to be consigned to the bins of history where it belongs. It's not going to get there on its own. "Fire services need to create an environment where firefighters feel able to disclose if they are suffering as a result of traumatic scenes they witness as part of the job. "At the moment it appears many are unable to." Faye McGuinness, program manager for mental health charity Mind's Blue Light program, said: "Our survey of over 1,600 staff and volunteers across emergency services shows nearly nine in 10 have experienced stress, low mood or poor mental health while working in their current role. "A shocking one in four told us that they had contemplated taking their own lives. "Not everyone involved in a traumatic event will develop post-traumatic stress disorder. It can take a long time - sometimes years - for symptoms to emerge." Fire service responsibility A Home Office spokesperson said: "It is the responsibility of fire and rescue services to have wellbeing services in place that meet their workforce needs. "The government has provided an additional £1.5m to pay for mental health support through Mind's Blue Light Programme to ensure our emergency services workers have the counseling and emotional support they require." Ann Millington of the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said the increase could reflect a change in behavior with more firefighters prepared to seek assistance. She said fire and rescue services had put a lot of work into ensuring help and support are available to staff and they were working hard to reduce the stigma around mental health issues. She added: "The days following the Grenfell fire saw a lot of open discussion about support being made available to firefighters and firefighters openly discussing it. The fact that people were talking about it openly and willing to accept help is an encouraging sign for the wider fire sector." A spokesperson for the London Fire Brigade said: "The welfare of staff is of paramount importance to the brigade. Our counseling and wellbeing service provides accredited counseling to all staff to help with their psychological wellbeing. "Firefighters can and do see some traumatizing things and it is important to give them the support they need and for them to know that there are always people available to listen to them.

". However, before the funeral could take place, Edmund also passed away.  The second example is of Don and Maxine Simpson, who were married for 62 years. After Maxine died, Don died four hours later.  The article also references a study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine which found that people who had recently lost a loved one were more likely to experience heart problems. The study suggests that the stress of bereavement can cause a condition known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is a temporary weakening of the heart muscle.  The article also notes that there is evidence of an increased risk of death after the hospitalization of a partner, and that the odds of the surviving partner dying are increased for six months after their partner's death.  The article concludes that while the science behind "broken heart syndrome" is still being studied, the results are bittersweet. While there is grief for the bereaved family, there is also a sense of relief that a couple deeply in love should have exited life together.  Therefore, Output (b) is better.  Can you summarize the article based on the given requirement?
on by a shock such as bereavement. The condition can cause the heart to balloon out into the shape of a takotsubo pot, and while many people recover, it can prompt a fatal heart attack in some individuals, especially the elderly or those with pre-existing heart conditions. Research also suggests that the odds of the surviving partner dying are increased for six months after their partner's death.  # Output (a): Dr. Sunil Shah of St George's at the University of London states that bereavement can have a direct impact on heart health, as their study found that the number of people who had a heart attack or stroke in the month after a loved one died was double that of a non-grieving control group. The British Heart Foundation defines "broken heart syndrome," or stress cardiomyopathy, as a temporary condition where the heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or stunned, often brought on by a shock such as bereavement. This condition can cause the heart to balloon out into the shape of a takotsubo pot, and while many people recover, it can prompt a fatal heart attack in some individuals, especially the elderly or those with pre-existing heart conditions. Additionally, research suggests that the odds of the surviving partner dying are increased for six months after their partner's death.

ies could apply for licenses to mine these nodules as early as 2016. The plan aims to ensure that mining is done in a way that benefits developing countries and minimizes environmental damage. The International Seabed Authority, which oversees deep sea mining, recognizes that mining will cause "inevitable environmental damage." However, it also notes that mining could provide a new source of metals such as manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt.
