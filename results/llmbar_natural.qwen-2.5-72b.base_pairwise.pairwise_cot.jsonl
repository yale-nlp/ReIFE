The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\n# Instruction:\nis it possible for a planet to have life, but lack the resources for achieving space flight? I am looking to write a sci-fi story. The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.

A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).", "instruction": "is it possible for a planet to have life, but lack the resources for achieving space flight?

Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\n# Instruction:\nSummarize the following content.\n\nI'm a student in Ireland. I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here? I don't really know anything about finance, or what's actually going on. I really want to help my parents, but at the same time I have to protect myself too.\n\n# Output (a):\nI'm a student in Ireland. I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy mom asked me to hide her \u20ac12,000 savings from the bank so that the bank doesn't know about it. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster. Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "After giving a brief explanation, select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\n# Instruction:\nHow do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity? \n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems.

He laughed when he said he might buy a pizza. We went to the right nearby place. He had won the contest and enjoyed dinner.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere were just six people at the dinner. The show's DJ was very inviting, but only for one person. He played a duet with a few other people.

Before kicking off a new week of clues and answers, The Big Bang Theory alum attended the 27th Critics' Choice Awards on Sunday night, and she opened up about what her future on Jeopardy! might look like.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

We have been in a relationship for 2 years and have been best friends for 2 before that. He loves always having plans and hanging out with people, which I also sometimes enjoy doing but I also need nights where we can just stay in and watch movies or do nothing. Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns.

He thinks I'm being lazy and doesn't understand why I need a night in.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend is an extrovert and loves to hang out with friends, I am an introvert and need nights alone to relax. He doesn't understand my need for a night in, and it puts me under stress. How do I get him to understand?\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\n# Instruction:\nCreate a neural network for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs.\n\n# Output (a):\nSure! Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Output (b):\nA neural network can be used for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs. The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training. Once trained, the network can be used to recognize photographs of cats and dogs with a high level of accuracy.\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "After giving a brief explanation, select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\n# Instruction:\nExplain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Output (b):\nSelf-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 1, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

It should have a well-organized layout with a consistent color scheme that aligns with the brand's identity. The website should also have a responsive design, meaning it should look good and function well on all devices.\n\nIn terms of feel, the website should be user-friendly and intuitive. The website should also make users feel secure, especially if they're required to enter personal information or make a purchase.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe ideal website content should be engaging, relevant, and tailored to the intended audience. It should offer high-quality, original information that is regularly updated to remain current. Multimedia elements like images, videos, and infographics should complement the text to enhance understanding and retain user interest. Clear, concise language and well-structured formatting, including short paragraphs, bullet points, and subheadings, make the content easily digestible. Above all, the content should provide genuine value to the user, addressing their needs or queries while maintaining authenticity and credibility.\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\n# Instruction:\nDescribe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Output (b):\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "Output (b) provides a more comprehensive and accurate description of the differences between Shakespearean and modern English.

modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.", "output_2": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.

Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there?

Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world.

It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (a):\nThese people can\u2019t be trusted whatsoever, you should make a scene at his school to show people the consequences of their ill behavior.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit?

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\n# Instruction:\nCompare and contrast the languages spoken in the United States, following the common requirements of writing a compare-and-contrast essay\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe United States is a linguistically diverse country with over 350 languages spoken. The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "After giving a brief explanation, select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\n# Instruction:\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nDo you know of anyone who was unable to become an engineer despite getting the degree and their best efforts? Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "Output (b) provides a more comprehensive and structured response, addressing the user's concerns about networking, skill enhancement, and the consideration of a CAD operator position.

Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons.

However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\n# Instruction:\nI work at a fully remote software company that has multiple, functional departments that work on different projects that span across the organization. One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops.

There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events. It is a way pivotal part of many areas of mathematics, science, technology, and more. It is also helpful for simply interacting with other people and the world around us.

This sentence also reveals the person's lack of interest in shopping, which could be due to financial or time constraints.\n\n# Output (b):\nThis sentence is an example of an excuse.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

Going for a walk, either alone or with friends.\n2. Going to a park or other outdoor area to play a game or engage in some activity.\n3. Getting some fresh air or sunshine. \n4.

Leaving the house and coming back inside.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe instruction \"Go outside\" can have different meanings depending on the situation. For example, if a parent tells their child to go outside to play, it can mean leaving the house and going to a nearby park or play area. But if a doctor tells a patient to go outside, it can mean stepping outside of the hospital or clinic for some fresh air and relaxation. In both cases, the literal act of going outside is the same, but the intent behind the instructions can be drastically different.\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

When a customer requests a taxi, the system needs to determine which taxi to send to the customer to minimize the total journey time for all customers. The taxi with the shortest estimated total journey time can be given the highest priority and served first.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "After giving a brief explanation, select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\n# Instruction:\nWhat is the best way to defeat a demon? I believe in Jesus Christ\n\n# Output (a):\nThe best way to defeat a demon is to use the power of God. Jesus Christ has the authority and power to defeat demons and to set the captive free. The Bible teaches us to pray to God for help in times of trouble, and to seek His will in our lives. God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful. But God is greater than any demon, and He has the power to defeat them. Trust in God and He will help you.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe best way to defeat depression can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their condition. However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, don't hesitate to seek help.\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it.
