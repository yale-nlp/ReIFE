She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years.

I am looking to write a sci-fi story. The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\nThe output provides relevant scientific information about the gravitational potential well of a planet and how it affects the size of rockets needed for space flight.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the\nbetter.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.\n\nYou should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.

Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\nThe output demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem and uses algebraic steps to solve it.

Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\nThe output partially addresses the instruction by providing information about a possible combination of engineering and physics in the form of an engineering physics degree. It also shares some personal experience and job market insights. However, it lacks a direct answer to the specific concerns about balancing engineering studies with a passion for physics, and it does not address the question about pursuing physics as a standalone career option to help the family financially. The output could have been more precise by directly addressing the balance between engineering and physics studies, and offering more guidance on potential career paths in physics that might alleviate the financial concerns.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\nThe output partially executes the instruction by addressing the aspect of combining engineering and physics. It provides some useful information about the potential for a dual degree or engineering physics program, which could be helpful for the student. However, the response is not entirely precise, as it incorrectly states that IT is not engineering, which might confuse the reader. Additionally, the output does not directly address the concern about managing time for the student's passion for physics while pursuing engineering (IT) and does not provide any specific advice on how to balance the two or explore career options that might satisfy both interests. The response would be stronger if it acknowledged the time management challenge and offered more personalized advice on balancing studies, pursuing passions, and considering potential career paths in both fields.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "Output (b) is better because it provides more relevant information about a specific degree program that combines engineering and physics, which is closer to the instruction's request for advice on pursuing both interests.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the\nbetter.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.\n\nYou should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.

The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems.

It conveys the parent's disapproval based on the boyfriend's ethnicity, the upcoming visit, and the dilemma the individual faces about whether to inform their parents or not. The summary maintains the essential context and the core question the individual is seeking advice on. Therefore, the output follows the instruction by precisely executing it, maintaining helpfulness, and being accurate. There are no critical drawbacks in this output that violate the evaluation rules provided.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\nThe output summarizes the main point of the content by mentioning the visit of the user's boyfriend and the uncertainty about informing the parents. However, it does not retain the context that the parents' disapproval is due to cultural differences or that the user has been dating for two years with the knowledge of their parents for one year. Additionally, it misses the aspect of the internship abroad and the potential impact on the relationship's seriousness.

It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2.

It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\nThe output accurately and precisely explains the differences between Shakespearean and modern English, highlighting the unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation of the former, as well as the simplification and standardization of the latter.

Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\nThe output is mostly sarcastic and\u8d34\u8fd1 the \"mean girl\" tone requested, which makes it engaging and humorous.

It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world.

He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit?

However, it does not directly address the core concern about the school's responsibility in managing the child's peanut allergy and ensuring a safe environment. The output partially executes the instruction by offering an alternative approach but misses the focus on evaluating the school's actions and their duty to accommodate the child's allergy.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\nThe output does not precisely execute the instruction as it does not provide advice that is helpful or constructive for the situation described. Instead, it suggests making a scene at the school, which is not a professional or productive approach to addressing the issue. The response lacks empathy and understanding of the situation, and it does not offer any actionable steps or strategies to ensure the child's safety in school. The evaluation rule (1) is not met, as the output does not honestly and precisely address the instruction.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts.

However, it does not precisely execute the instruction because it does not handle the year and month of the input date. The function `date.day()` is used, which implies that the input is a `date` object, but no method to create a `date` object from the provided \"5th January, 2021\" is included. To fix this, the function should accept a date string as input and convert it to a `date` object before determining the day of the week. Additionally, the instruction asks for a program, which typically includes a way to call or execute the function, such as a test case or main block.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\nThe output precisely executes the instruction by creating a Python program that determines the day of the week for the given date (5th January, 2021). It uses the `datetime` module to create a date object and then retrieves the day of the week using the `weekday()` method, which returns a number representing the day of the week (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, and so on). The output is helpful as it not only provides the numerical representation (1) but also gives the corresponding day (Tuesday) in a comment. The code is concise, accurate, and harmless. There are no critical drawbacks in this output based on the evaluation rules provided.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "Therefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"Therefore": -0.022959938272833824}, {",": 0.0}, {" Output": -1.1920928244535389e-07}, {" (": 0.0}, {"a": -1.0132738680113107e-05}, {")": 0.0}, {" is": 0.0}, {" better": 0.0}, {".": -0.00015078838623594493}, {"<|im_end|>": -2.6702524337451905e-05}], "tokens": ["Therefore", ",", " Output", " (", "a", ")", " is", " better", ".", "<|im_end|>"]}], "data": {"output_1": "import datetime\ndate = datetime.date(2021, 1, 5)\nday = date.weekday()\nprint(day) # 1 (meaning Tuesday)", "output_2": "def getDayOfWeek(date): \n    day = date.day() \n    if day == 6:\n        return \"Sunday\"\n    elif day == 5:\n        return \"Monday\"\n    elif day == 4:\n        return \"Tuesday\"\n    elif day == 3:\n        return \"Wednesday\"\n    elif day == 2:\n        return \"Thursday\"\n    elif day == 1:\n        return \"Friday\" \n    else:\n        return \"Saturday\"", "instruction": "Create a program that determines the day of the week for a given date.\nDate: 5th January, 2021.", "winner": 1}, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 1}
