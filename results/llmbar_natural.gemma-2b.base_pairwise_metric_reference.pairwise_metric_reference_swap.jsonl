We have gone down the job route, to the point that she was offered the job here, but the employer failed to get a license to issue Visas on very petty grounds.\nI (and others) have suggested getting married. It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years. We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\n\n# Output (a):\nMy girlfriend's visa to stay in the UK expires in a few months, and she wants to stay here, but she won't get married until she goes back to Malaysia.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How does the author's perspective on the situation differ from that of the other individuals involved? \n\n\n 2.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nHow many integers are in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10 ? \n\n# Output (b):\nThe list of integers that satisfy the inequality |x + 5| < 10 contains -4, -3, -2, -1 , 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Any integer smaller than -4 or larger than 4 will violate the inequality. Therefore, there are a total of 9 integers that satisfy |x + 10| < 5.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe inequality |x + 5| < 10 means that the absolute value of x + 5 is less than 10.\nSince the absolute value is always non-negative, this is equivalent to -10 < x + 5 < 10.\nSubtracting 5 from all parts, we get -15 < x < 5.\nTherefore, the solution set contains all integers between -15 and 5, exclusive. \nThere are 5 - (-15) - 1 = 19 integers in the solution set.\n\nSo the number of integers in the solution is 19\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How many distinct integers are present in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10? \n\n\n 2.

The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Does the scenario provide a clear and concise explanation of why a civilization might lack the resources to build a rocket? \n\n\n 2.

essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.

Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.", "output_2": "You can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).", "instruction": "is it possible for a planet to have life, but lack the resources for achieving space flight?

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nExplain: Pathos, Ethos, Logos \n\n# Output (b):\nPathos is a tool of persuasion that is used to appeal to readers' emotions by arousing positive or negative feelings. It can be used in rhetoric, literature, film, and other forms of expression. While pathos is used to draw an emotional response, the other rhetorical appeals appeal to credibility and logic, respectively. Ethos is the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution. It is often evident as facts, numbers, or statistics and is used to convince an audience of an argument.\n\n# Output (a):\nEthos is the ethical appeal, which is used to convince an audience of the author's credibility or character. Pathos is the emotional appeal, which is used to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions. Logos is the appeal to logic and is used to convince an audience by the use of logic and reason.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately identify the three elements of Pathos, Ethos, and Logos? \n\n\n 2. Does the output provide a clear and concise explanation of each element? \n\n\n 3. Does the output provide additional context or relevant information that would be helpful for understanding the instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n**Pathos:** Pathos is the ability to evoke emotions in the audience through storytelling, vivid imagery, and emotional language. \n\n **Ethos:** Ethos is the credibility and integrity of the speaker or writer. It is built on honesty, trustworthiness, and adherence to ethical principles. \n\n **Logos:** Logos is the use of logic and reason to persuade the audience.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nSome people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus stop, half of the people got down and 4 more people got in.

If there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal? \n\n# Output (b):\nLet's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. \n\nAt the first stop, half of the people got down, so there were x/2 people left on the bus. Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here? I don't really know anything about finance, or what's actually going on. I really want to help my parents, but at the same time I have to protect myself too.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy mom asked me to hide her \u20ac12,000 savings from the bank so that the bank doesn't know about it.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nI don't want to be an engineer, I like physics. Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster. Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How can you ensure that your engineering coursework will still allow you to delve into and learn about atomic and cosmological physics? \n\n\n 2. What specific courses or projects would you recommend to take within the engineering program that would allow you to explore and apply your passion for physics? \n\n\n 3. How can you effectively manage the time and workload required to pursue both your engineering studies and your passion for physics?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, here's some advice on balancing your passion for physics and engineering: \n\n **1. Explore the overlap between physics and engineering:** \n\n - Look for courses or projects that combine both subjects, such as engineering mechanics or computational physics. \n - Take electives or participate in extracurricular activities related to both fields. \n\n **2. Discuss your aspirations with your parents:** \n\n - Explain your passion for physics and its importance to you. \n - Emphasize that engineering can still be intellectually challenging and rewarding. \n - Discuss the potential for career growth and financial stability in both fields. \n\n **3. Seek guidance from mentors or professionals:** \n\n - Talk to engineers or physicists who can provide insights and guidance. \n - Attend career fairs or industry events to network and learn about the industry. \n\n **4. Prioritize communication and time management:** \n\n - Explain your passion for physics to your parents and demonstrate its value to them. \n - Set realistic expectations and timelines for balancing both academic pursuits. \n\n **5. Consider a dual-degree program:** \n\n - Some universities offer programs that allow you to pursue two degrees simultaneously. \n - This can provide a structured approach to learning and balancing your responsibilities. \n\n **6. Explore freelance or part-time opportunities:** \n\n - While pursuing your engineering degree, you can explore freelance or part-time physics projects or internships. \n - These can help you stay engaged with physics while earning income. \n\n **7. Be open to alternative career paths:** \n\n - While engineering may not be your first choice, it can still be a fulfilling career path. \n - Explore other engineering specializations, such as software engineering or data science. \n\n **8. Remember that passion is a journey, not a destination:** \n\n - Don't feel pressured to make a final decision right away. \n - Allow yourself to explore different options and find your true calling. \n\n **9. Focus on your strengths and interests:** \n\n - While you may have a passion for physics, it's important to find a field of engineering that aligns with your strengths and interests. \n\n **10. Seek support from your school counselor or career advisor:** \n\n - They can provide guidance and support in navigating your career path.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Does the output provide a real-world example of how herd immunity can protect a community from an infectious disease? \n\n\n 3. How does the output address the question of why vaccination is important for protecting individuals and communities from infectious diseases?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, here's a concise explanation of how vaccinations work and the concept of herd immunity: \n\n **How vaccinations work:** \n\n 1. **Immunity response:** When you get vaccinated, your immune system recognizes the foreign pathogen (virus or bacteria) and responds by producing antibodies and memory cells. These antibodies help your body fight off the infection if you are ever exposed to the real disease in the future. \n 2. **Activation of immune cells:** Antibodies bind to specific antigens (molecules on the surface of the pathogen) and activate immune cells, such as T cells and B cells. These cells recognize and attack the pathogen, destroying it or preventing it from multiplying. \n 3. **Memory formation:** In addition to producing antibodies, your immune system also forms memory cells. These cells \"remember\" the pathogen and can quickly produce antibodies and mount a more robust immune response if you are exposed to the real disease in the future. \n\n **Herd immunity:** \n\n Herd immunity refers to the indirect protection that is provided to unvaccinated individuals when a large proportion of the population is vaccinated. When a high percentage of people are vaccinated, it creates a barrier or \"herd immunity\" that prevents the pathogen from spreading and infecting those who are unvaccinated. \n\n **Benefits of herd immunity:** \n\n * Reduced spread of diseases: Herd immunity helps control the spread of infectious diseases by preventing them from spreading from vaccinated individuals to unvaccinated individuals. \n * Protection for vulnerable populations: Individuals with weakened immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and people with chronic diseases, are more vulnerable to severe illness. Herd immunity provides them with additional protection. \n * Economic benefits: Herd immunity can reduce the need for expensive medical care and reduce the economic burden associated with infectious diseases. \n\n **It's important to note that vaccinations are an essential public health tool for preventing and controlling infectious diseases. Getting vaccinated can help protect yourself, your loved ones, and your community from preventable diseases.**\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.", "instruction": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?

We have been in a relationship for 2 years and have been best friends for 2 before that. He loves always having plans and hanging out with people, which I also sometimes enjoy doing but I also need nights where we can just stay in and watch movies or do nothing. Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns. How do I get him to see my point of view?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend is an extrovert and loves to hang out with friends, I am an introvert and need nights alone to relax.

He thinks I'm being lazy and doesn't understand why I need a night in.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How can you effectively communicate your need for a night in to your boyfriend without feeling guilty or selfish? \n\n\n 2.

Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns.

The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training. Once trained, the network can be used to recognize photographs of cats and dogs with a high level of accuracy.\n\n# Output (a):\nSure! Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nExplain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\n# Output (b):\nSelf-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately identify the different parts of the instruction (e.g., \"self-supervised learning,\" \"Natural Language Processing,\" \"NLP\")? \n\n\n 2. Does the output provide a clear and concise explanation of how self-supervised learning contributes to NLP? \n\n\n 3. Does the output offer a specific and relevant example of how self-supervised learning is used in NLP?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, here's why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP): \n\n **1. Reduced Annotation Burden:** \n Self-supervised learning eliminates the need for manual human annotation, which can be expensive and time-consuming. This allows NLP models to be trained on a wider range of data, including unlabeled or semi-labeled examples. \n\n **2. Data Representation Learning:** \n Self-supervised tasks force models to learn representations of the data, capturing both semantic and syntactic relationships between words. This enhances the model's ability to understand and generate natural language text. \n\n **3. Robustness to Data Quality:** \n Self-supervised learning is less sensitive to data quality issues. It can handle noisy or incomplete data, making it suitable for real-world NLP applications. \n\n **4. Unsupervised Learning Capabilities:** \n Self-supervised tasks can be used for unsupervised learning, where the model learns meaningful representations from unlabeled data. This is particularly useful for NLP tasks where labeled data is scarce. \n\n **5. Improved Model Generalization:** \n Self-supervised learning can help improve the generalization ability of NLP models. By exposing them to diverse unlabeled data, models learn to make robust predictions across different tasks and domains. \n\n **6. Scalability:** \n Self-supervised learning can be scaled to large datasets, making it suitable for handling massive amounts of text data. \n\n **7. Applications in Various Domains:** \n Self-supervised learning has proven effective in various NLP tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering. \n\n Overall, self-supervised learning is a valuable technique that reduces annotation burden, enhances data representation learning, improves robustness to data quality, enables unsupervised learning, improves model generalization, and is scalable for large datasets.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Data Representation Learning:** \n Self-supervised tasks force models to learn representations of the data, capturing both semantic and syntactic relationships between words. This enhances the model's ability to understand and generate natural language text. \n\n **3. Robustness to Data Quality:** \n Self-supervised learning is less sensitive to data quality issues. It can handle noisy or incomplete data, making it suitable for real-world NLP applications. \n\n **4. Unsupervised Learning Capabilities:** \n Self-supervised tasks can be used for unsupervised learning, where the model learns meaningful representations from unlabeled data. This is particularly useful for NLP tasks where labeled data is scarce. \n\n **5. Improved Model Generalization:** \n Self-supervised learning can help improve the generalization ability of NLP models. By exposing them to diverse unlabeled data, models learn to make robust predictions across different tasks and domains. \n\n **6. Scalability:** \n Self-supervised learning can be scaled to large datasets, making it suitable for handling massive amounts of text data. \n\n **7. Applications in Various Domains:** \n Self-supervised learning has proven effective in various NLP tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering. \n\n Overall, self-supervised learning is a valuable technique that reduces annotation burden, enhances data representation learning, improves robustness to data quality, enables unsupervised learning, improves model generalization, and is scalable for large datasets.", "metric": "1.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nWhat is the purpose of the `key` argument in the Python sorted() function and what should I pass as inputs?\n\n# Output (b):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to specify a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the input iterable. The items are then sorted based on the values returned by this function.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to define a key for sorting. It is used to tell the function how to compare two strings to determine which one should be placed before the other in the sorted output.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. What are the different types of arguments that can be passed to the `key` argument in the `sorted()` function? \n\n\n 2. How does the order of the arguments affect the sorting behavior? \n\n\n 3. What are some valid and invalid values for the `key` argument, and how do they affect the sorting outcome?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, here's a concise explanation of the `key` argument in the Python `sorted()` function: \n\n **Purpose:** \n\n The `key` argument specifies a function that returns a single value for each element in the iterable. This value is used to determine the order of the elements in the sorted output. \n\n **Arguments:** \n\n The `key` argument takes a function as its argument. The function should take an element from the iterable as its input and return a single value. This value can be any data type, but it will be converted to a string before sorting. \n\n **Example:** \n\n ```python \n data = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9] \n\n # Sort the data in ascending order based on the key function \n sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x) \n\n # Print the sorted data \n print(sorted_data) \n ``` \n\n **Output:** \n\n ``` \n [1, 2, 5, 8, 9] \n ``` \n\n **Additional Notes:** \n\n * The `key` argument can also be a complex function that combines multiple values into a single output. \n * The `key` function is called on each element in the iterable before the elements are sorted. \n * The `key` function is responsible for generating the order of the elements in the sorted output. \n * The `key` argument is optional, but it is often used to provide a way to control the sorting order. \n\n I hope this explanation is helpful.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How would you introduce yourself in a lecture on a topic related to your expertise? \n\n\n 2. What are the key points you would cover in your introduction? \n\n\n 3. How would you ensure that your introduction effectively captures the attention of your audience?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nMy name is Sarah, and I am a passionate advocate for lifelong learning and personal growth.

It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n**Question 1:** \n How does the use of the word \"royal\" in Shakespearean English differ from its use in modern English?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, here's a concise description of the differences between Shakespearean and modern English: \n\n **Shakespearean English:** \n\n * **Complex syntax:** Shakespearean English has complex sentence structures with multiple clauses and subordinate clauses. \n * **Use of figurative language:** Shakespearean English often uses metaphors, similes, and personification to create vivid imagery and emotional impact. \n * **Emphasis on rhyme and meter:** Shakespearean English has strict adherence to rhyme schemes and meter, which can be challenging for modern speakers to adhere to. \n\n **Modern English:** \n\n * **Simplified syntax:** Modern English has simpler sentence structures with fewer clauses and more straightforward word order. \n * **Less use of figurative language:** Modern English uses simpler and more direct language, with less emphasis on metaphors and similes. \n * **Relaxation of rhyme and meter:** Modern English allows for more flexibility in rhyme schemes and meter, making it easier for modern speakers to read. \n\n **Example:** \n\n **Shakespearean:** \n > \"The course of true love never did run smooth.\" \n\n **Modern:** \n > \"True love's course is rarely smooth.\" \n\n In summary, Shakespearean English is characterized by its complex syntax, use of figurative language, and strict adherence to rhyme and meter. Modern English, on the other hand, is simpler, more straightforward, and less restrictive in its syntax.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)? Your response should be either \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\":", "role": "user"}], "reference": "Sure, here's a concise description of the differences between Shakespearean and modern English: \n\n **Shakespearean English:** \n\n * **Complex syntax:** Shakespearean English has complex sentence structures with multiple clauses and subordinate clauses. \n * **Use of figurative language:** Shakespearean English often uses metaphors, similes, and personification to create vivid imagery and emotional impact. \n * **Emphasis on rhyme and meter:** Shakespearean English has strict adherence to rhyme schemes and meter, which can be challenging for modern speakers to adhere to. \n\n **Modern English:** \n\n * **Simplified syntax:** Modern English has simpler sentence structures with fewer clauses and more straightforward word order. \n * **Less use of figurative language:** Modern English uses simpler and more direct language, with less emphasis on metaphors and similes. \n * **Relaxation of rhyme and meter:** Modern English allows for more flexibility in rhyme schemes and meter, making it easier for modern speakers to read. \n\n **Example:** \n\n **Shakespearean:** \n > \"The course of true love never did run smooth.\" \n\n **Modern:** \n > \"True love's course is rarely smooth.\" \n\n In summary, Shakespearean English is characterized by its complex syntax, use of figurative language, and strict adherence to rhyme and meter.

Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How did the Russian Revolution impact the social class system in Russia? \n\n\n 2. What were some of the most outrageous and ridiculous things the Soviet government did during the Revolution? \n\n\n 3. How did the Russian Revolution affect the lives of ordinary people in Russia?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSo, the Russian Revolution was basically this huge rebellion where the people were like, \"Screw the Tsar! We're taking back our country!\" and then they just started throwing parties and stuff. It was pretty wild, honestly. And the worst part? They tried to overthrow the whole government with a giant cake. Like, a literal cake bomb. It was pretty epic, honestly.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit? The school might not see the problem with their actions, but their insurance might. Maybe submitting a claim would get their attention?\n\n# Output (a):\nThese people can\u2019t be trusted whatsoever, you should make a scene at his school to show people the consequences of their ill behavior.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the school have a clear and consistent policy regarding peanut allergies? \n\n\n 2. How does the school ensure that teachers are aware of and follow the school's peanut allergy policy? \n\n\n 3. How can the school better educate parents and students about the risks associated with peanut allergies?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, here's some advice on the situation: \n\n 1. **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed record of all the incidents, including dates, times, and specific details of what happened. This will be helpful if you need to take legal action or report the issue to the school board. \n\n\n 2. **Communicate Openly:** Talk to your son about the importance of being honest and telling the truth. Explain that lying can have serious consequences, not only for himself but also for others who may be allergic to peanuts. \n\n\n 3. **Educate the School Staff:** Provide the school staff with information about peanut allergies and educate them on how to handle them safely. This could include training on how to identify peanut traces, how to handle spills or accidents, and how to communicate with your son's classmates and teachers. \n\n\n 4. **Demand Change:** If the school is not willing to take the necessary steps to ensure your son's safety, you may need to consider speaking to the school board or seeking legal advice. \n\n\n 5. **Stay Calm and Composed:** It can be difficult to deal with a situation like this, but it's important to stay calm and composed. This will help you to think clearly and make rational decisions. \n\n\n 6. **Seek Support:** Talk to other parents of children with peanut allergies or seek support from support groups or online forums. Having a sense of community can be helpful during this difficult time.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Maybe submitting a claim would get their attention?", "instruction": "Provide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nSon has a peanut allergy, and the school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts. This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.", "winner": 2}, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 1}

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nCompare and contrast the languages spoken in the United States, following the common requirements of writing a compare-and-contrast essay\n\n# Output (b):\nThe United States is a linguistically diverse country with over 350 languages spoken. The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How does the structure of language used in the US compare to the structure of language used in other countries? \n\n\n 2. What are the key differences in the vocabulary used in the US and other countries? \n\n\n 3. How does the use of figurative language differ between the US and other cultures?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n**Comparison:** \n\n * **Number of languages:** The United States boasts over 300 languages, with the most common being English, Spanish, and Chinese. \n * **Official languages:** English is the official language in all 50 states, while Spanish is the official language in 29 states and territories. \n * **Regional languages:** Many regions have their own distinct languages, such as Appalachian English, Cajun French, and Hawaiian Creole. \n * **Language diversity:** The country is a melting pot of cultures and languages, with immigrants from various backgrounds contributing to its linguistic richness. \n\n **Contrast:** \n\n * **Historical origins:** English has a long and rich history in the United States, while Spanish arrived with the Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century. \n * **Socioeconomic factors:** English is often seen as a more prestigious language, while Spanish is more prevalent in working-class communities. \n * **Political and cultural influence:** English is the language of international diplomacy and business, while Spanish is the language of Latin America and the Caribbean. \n * **Standard vs. non-standard varieties:** English has several dialects and regional variations, while Spanish is relatively standardized. \n * **Influence on other languages:** English has had a significant influence on other languages spoken in the United States, such as Portuguese and Haitian Creole. \n\n **Conclusion:** \n\n The United States boasts a linguistic tapestry of languages, with English, Spanish, and Chinese being the most widely spoken. While English is the official language, Spanish is the most prevalent in certain regions and among immigrant communities. The country's linguistic diversity reflects its rich history, cultural heritage, and ongoing immigration.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nDo you know of anyone who was unable to become an engineer despite getting the degree and their best efforts? Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How did the candidate's lack of engineering experience impact their chances of securing an engineering position despite getting the degree? \n\n\n 2. What were the specific challenges and obstacles the candidate faced in their job search, particularly in the tech/CAD operator field? \n\n\n 3. How did the candidate's limited time frame for career development affect their decision-making process and priorities in seeking employment?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n**Seek Alternative Options:** \n\n * **Consider Pursuing a Different Engineering Path:** Explore other engineering specializations that might align with your interests and skills. \n * **Network with Professionals in the Industry:** Attend industry events, connect with engineers on LinkedIn, and reach out to alumni from your university. \n * **Volunteer or Intern in Engineering-Related Fields:** Gain practical experience and build your network. \n * **Explore Apprenticeship Programs:** These programs offer hands-on training and mentorship in the engineering field. \n * **Consider Pursuing a Degree in a Related Field:** A degree in computer science, mathematics, or a related field can provide a strong foundation for engineering. \n\n **Focus on Building Your Skills and Experience:** \n\n * **Take Online Courses or Bootcamps:** These programs can provide you with the necessary skills and knowledge to enter the engineering field. \n * **Volunteer or Intern in Engineering Firms:** Seek out opportunities to apply your skills and learn from experienced engineers. \n * **Build Your Portfolio:** Create a website or online portfolio showcasing your projects and skills. \n\n **Stay Positive and Persistent:** \n\n * **Remember that setbacks are part of the process.** \n * **Focus on your long-term career goals and don't give up on yourself.** \n * **Seek support from family, friends, and mentors.** \n\n **Additional Tips:** \n\n * **Update Your Resume and Cover Letter:** Highlight your relevant skills and experience. \n * **Practice Your Interview Skills:** Prepare for common engineering interview questions. \n * **Network with Professionals in the Industry:** Attend industry events, connect with engineers on LinkedIn, and reach out to alumni from your university.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How can we effectively identify and prioritize the most important dependencies between different departments within the company? \n\n\n 2. What innovative and creative solutions could we implement to address the issue of workflow bottlenecks across departments? \n\n\n 3. How can we track and measure the impact of these changes on the overall development process and team productivity?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\n**Organizational Change to Resolve Workflow Bottlenecks:** \n\n **1. Establish a Cross-Departmental Roadmap:** \n - Create a shared roadmap that outlines the overall project goals and dependencies between teams. \n - Use tools like Kanban boards or project management software to visualize the workflow and identify bottlenecks. \n\n **2. Foster Collaboration and Communication:** \n - Implement regular team meetings and cross-departmental workshops to promote communication and collaboration. \n - Encourage knowledge sharing and cross-team mentoring programs. \n\n **3.

The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops.

Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nGive me an example of a situation involving the use of a priority queue.\n\n# Output (b):\nA priority queue can be used in a taxi dispatch system. When a customer requests a taxi, the system needs to determine which taxi to send to the customer to minimize the total journey time for all customers. The taxi with the shortest estimated total journey time can be given the highest priority and served first. The system can serve the taxi with the highest priority first until one is served or the queue is empty.\n\n# Output (a):\nFor example, a total order of tasks can be established, with each task having a priority associated with it. Tasks with a higher priority can be given preference and processed before tasks with a lower priority. This ensures that the most important tasks are processed first.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How does the output handle empty input? \n 2. How does the output handle a situation where the input exceeds the maximum size allowed by the instruction? \n 3. How does the output handle a situation where the input is not a valid data type for the instruction?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, here's an example of a situation involving the use of a priority queue: \n\n **Scenario:** \n\n A hospital is implementing a new patient tracking system to improve patient safety and efficiency. The system uses a priority queue to manage the order in which patients are seen by medical professionals. \n\n * **Priority queue implementation:** \n     * Patients are added to the priority queue based on their urgency and medical importance. \n     * The system maintains a maximum capacity of 10 patients in the priority queue. \n     * When a new patient arrives, it is added to the end of the queue. \n     * The patient at the front of the queue is treated first. \n     * If the priority queue is full, the newest patient is added to the end of the queue, and any patients at the front of the queue are moved down one position. \n\n **Benefits of using a priority queue:** \n\n * **Improved patient care:** By prioritizing patients based on their urgency, the system ensures that the most critical patients receive care first. \n * **Reduced waiting times:** Patients are seen in the order they are added to the queue, reducing waiting times and improving patient satisfaction. \n * **Efficient resource allocation:** The system ensures that resources are allocated to patients in a way that optimizes patient care and reduces idle time. \n\n **Example:** \n\n A hospital receives 10 patients with different medical conditions and urgency levels. The system uses a priority queue to determine the order in which patients are seen by medical professionals. \n\n * Patient 1 has a life-threatening condition and is immediately added to the priority queue. \n * Patient 2 has a less critical condition and is added to the queue next. \n * Patient 3 is a high-priority patient with a stable condition. \n * Patient 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are added to the queue in order of decreasing urgency. \n * Patient 10 is added to the queue last, as there are no more beds available. \n\n **Conclusion:** \n\n The priority queue effectively manages the order of patient care in this scenario, ensuring that the most critical patients receive care first while minimizing waiting times and resource waste.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support.

God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you.

God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful.

Trust in God and He will help you.", "output_2": "The best way to defeat depression can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their condition. However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it.
