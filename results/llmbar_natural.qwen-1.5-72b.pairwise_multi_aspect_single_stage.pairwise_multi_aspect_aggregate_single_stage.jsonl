{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\nHer visa to stay here is coming to an end later this year, then she will be forced to return to Malaysia despite opting to stay here if she had the choice. We have gone down the job route, to the point that she was offered the job here, but the employer failed to get a license to issue Visas on very petty grounds.\nI (and others) have suggested getting married. It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy girlfriend's visa to stay in the UK expires in a few months, and she wants to stay here, but she won't get married until she goes back to Malaysia.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years. We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall.

Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

I had fun that day.\n\n# Output (b):\nWe were expecting a refund. the next week, the store had an iPad. The next week, the other kids were transferred to the store. We were all the best we had ever washed the car.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs attempt to continue the story, but Output (a) stays more relevant to the initial sentence by focusing on the couple's experience on the bench.\n\n4.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs complete a brief story, but Output (a) stays more focused on the given starting sentence, while Output (b) deviates significantly.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it maintains a clear connection to the initial sentence, has a coherent storyline, and is more relevant to the task of completing a brief story.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

I am looking to write a sci-fi story. The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is written in a conversational tone and is easy to understand, while Output (b) uses more technical language and might be less accessible to a general audience.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a broader perspective on the scenario, discussing the possibility of a civilization without fossil fuels and suggesting alternative technologies. Output (b) focuses on the scientific aspect, suggesting a way to make space flight more challenging by altering the planet's properties.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) addresses the user's intention by exploring the feasibility of the scenario and offering creative ideas for the story. Output (b) provides a scientific explanation but does not directly address the storytelling aspect.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their respective areas. Output (a) discusses the historical context of space exploration and the potential for alternative energy sources, while Output (b) presents a valid scientific concept about gravitational potential wells.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) directly answers the question and provides additional context, while Output (b) focuses on one aspect of the question but does not address the civilization's ability to synthesize necessary chemicals.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is more suitable for a sci-fi story context, providing a broader range of ideas and considerations for the scenario.

Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.

For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).", "instruction": "is it possible for a planet to have life, but lack the resources for achieving space flight?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her? Again, sorry for my bad english =/\n\n# Output (a):\nI want to tell my sister that she should avoid getting drunk with people she doesn't know or trust to avoid drowning risk, but I also want to make her aware that rape fear is a serious issue.\n\n# Output (b):\nI want to give some advice to my 17-year-old sister to avoid risky situations while drunk, without instilling rape fear or guilt in her. How would you advise me to phrase my advice?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Pathos is the emotional appeal, which is used to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions. Logos is the appeal to logic and is used to convince an audience by the use of logic and reason.\n\n# Output (b):\nPathos is a tool of persuasion that is used to appeal to readers' emotions by arousing positive or negative feelings. It can be used in rhetoric, literature, film, and other forms of expression. While pathos is used to draw an emotional response, the other rhetorical appeals appeal to credibility and logic, respectively. Ethos is the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution. It is often evident as facts, numbers, or statistics and is used to convince an audience of an argument.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

At the first bus stop, half of the people got down and 4 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal? \n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (b):\nLet's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. \n\nAt the first stop, half of the people got down, so there were x/2 people left on the bus. Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall.

Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here? I don't really know anything about finance, or what's actually going on. I really want to help my parents, but at the same time I have to protect myself too.\n\n# Output (a):\nI'm a student in Ireland. I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy mom asked me to hide her \u20ac12,000 savings from the bank so that the bank doesn't know about it. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (b) is better as it directly quotes the relevant part of the original content, maintaining the context and avoiding any misinterpretation.\n\n2.

User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) is better as it infers the user's concern about the legality of the situation and their uncertainty about what actions to take.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in summarizing the main issue, which is the user's concern about the legality of hiding money in their account.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) is better as it more closely follows the instruction by focusing on the user's question about the legality and their next steps.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it effectively captures the user's concern and the main action they are questioning, making it a more precise summary of the original content.

You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster. Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and clear, but it contains a factual error by stating that IT is not engineering. Output (b) is also well-structured, with a personal anecdote that adds relevance and credibility.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides information on the potential career paths and salaries, but it doesn't directly address the feasibility of pursuing both physics and engineering. Output (b) offers a specific example of a degree program (engineering physics) that combines both fields and shares personal experience, which is more informative.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) doesn't directly address the user's financial concerns or the possibility of balancing physics and engineering. Output (b) implies that it's possible to pursue both interests with a specific degree program, which is more relevant to the user's question.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is inaccurate in its statement about IT not being a form of engineering. Output (b) is accurate and provides a real-life example of a degree that combines physics and engineering.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs address the user's desire to pursue physics while considering engineering, but Output (b) provides a more direct answer to the question of feasibility.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it offers a more relevant and accurate response to the user's situation, providing a specific degree program that combines physics and engineering, and shares a personal experience that supports the feasibility of the user's aspirations.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -6.6756979322235566e-06}, {".":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nHow do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity? \n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Output (b):\nVaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of a virus or bacteria, or parts of its structure such as proteins, into a person's body. The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured, fluent, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. They are coherent with a clear flow of ideas.\n\n2.

Output (a) omits these details but still conveys the main idea.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs directly answer the question about how vaccinations work and explain herd immunity, which is the user's intention.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their explanations.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction by addressing both parts of the question.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it offers a more comprehensive

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

To maintain the sovereignty and well-being of this revered land, I solemnly pledge my sword and honor. Bound by the code of chivalry, I vow to uphold justice, bring solace to the distressed, and safeguard the realm for all present and future generations. I invite you to rejoice in our mutual fellowship and indulge in the festivities of this magnificent royal banquet.\n\n# Output (b):\nAs a medieval knight, I would introduce myself at a royal banquet with a deep bow and a respectful speech, acknowledging my humble origins and my loyalty to the crown. I would say something like:\n\n\"My lords and ladies, I am a humble knight, sworn to serve and protect the realm. I come from a long line of warriors who have fought to defend this kingdom for generations. I am honored to be here today, in the presence of such an esteemed company, and I hope to earn your trust and respect with my deeds and actions. I pledge my sword, my shield, and my life to the service of my king and my people.\"\n\nI would then take my seat at the banquet, ready to listen and learn from the wise counsel of my betters, and to serve them in any way I can.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more details about the knight's role, the code of chivalry, and the kingdom, making it more immersive.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I am now doing a short internship abroad for 3 months, and he is planning on visiting. Should I tell my parents about this visit, especially if it will upset them greatly and disapprove of our decision to get more 'serious'? I know the easier thing to do would be not never tell them he visited, and to enjoy his company without having to deal with family drama. But is this a cop-out?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy boyfriend is visiting me while I'm in Europe, and I don't know if I should tell my parents about it.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy Indian parents disapprove of my white boyfriend for his ethnicity and will probably be upset if he visits me while I'm abroad. Should I tell them about his visit, or just enjoy his company without dealing with family drama?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) better infers the user's dilemma by explicitly stating the choice between telling the parents or not to avoid family drama, which is not mentioned in Output (a).\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately capture the main points, but Output (b) is more precise in describing the parents' disapproval and the situation.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs summarize the content, but Output (b) includes more details from the original text, making it a more complete summary.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

He laughed when he said he might buy a pizza. We went to the right nearby place. He had won the contest and enjoyed dinner.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere were just six people at the dinner. The show's DJ was very inviting, but only for one person. He played a duet with a few other people. It ended up being good.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more details about the characters and their actions, while Output (b) focuses on the atmosphere and the show's DJ.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction is to complete a brief story, so user intention inference is not applicable.\n\n4.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

We have been in a relationship for 2 years and have been best friends for 2 before that. He loves always having plans and hanging out with people, which I also sometimes enjoy doing but I also need nights where we can just stay in and watch movies or do nothing. Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns. How do I get him to see my point of view?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy boyfriend and I are always busy and I need a night in. He thinks I'm being lazy and doesn't understand why I need a night in.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend is an extrovert and loves to hang out with friends, I am an introvert and need nights alone to relax. He doesn't understand my need for a night in, and it puts me under stress. How do I get him to understand?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs summarize the content while keeping the main points, but Output (b) provides a more comprehensive summary.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it offers a more complete and accurate representation of the situation, providing more context and clarity.

This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGenerate two rhymes for the following word.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is straightforward, and both outputs have accurately inferred and executed the task.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in terms of providing words that rhyme with \"Moon.\"\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) precisely follows the instruction by providing two rhymes, while Output (b) goes beyond the instruction by providing four rhymes.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it provides more options, even though it exceeds the requested number of rhymes.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGiven the following input statement, provide the type of sentiment in the statement and the extent of sentiment in terms of sentiment scores.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more information by specifying the sentiment as \"Positive\", which is helpful for understanding the sentiment type.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction asks for both the sentiment type and the sentiment score. Output (b) directly addresses both aspects, while Output (a) only provides the score.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in conveying a high sentiment score, but Output (b) is more precise with a score of 9.5.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) fully follows the instruction by providing both the sentiment type and the sentiment score, while Output (a) omits the sentiment type.\n\nOverall,

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Output (b):\nA neural network can be used for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs. The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training. Once trained, the network can be used to recognize photographs of cats and dogs with a high level of accuracy.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nExplain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Output (b):\nSelf-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 1, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4.

Output (b) correctly initializes 'total' to 0 before the loop.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it correctly initializes the sum variable, avoiding a potential error in the function execution.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs have good text quality, with fluent and coherent sentences. Output (a) has a more descriptive and engaging narrative, while Output (b) is more straightforward.\n\n2.

Output (b) is less rich in detail, focusing on the physical journey without as much description.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to create a 5-sentence story about a person walking through a forest. Both outputs fulfill this intention, but Output (a) adds a sense of discovery and reflection, which adds depth to the story.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in terms of describing a person walking through a forest.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs consist of exactly five sentences and adhere to the instruction of creating a story about a person in a forest.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it offers a more immersive and emotionally engaging story, with rich descriptions and a sense of discovery that aligns well with the instruction.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, and both outputs address it directly.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) accurately converts the date, while Output (a) only gives the difference in days without the actual Julian date.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction by converting the date, but Output (b) provides a more complete answer by giving the exact Julian date.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is more informative and directly answers the question by providing the Julian calendar equivalent of the given date.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is a code snippet without any explanation or comments, while Output (b) is a complete function with a descriptive name and a print statement.\n\n2.

User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) better infers the user's intention by allowing the user to specify the length of the array, which is not possible with Output (a).\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in generating random numbers between 1 and 100.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) is more complete as it provides a function that generates an array of random numbers, fulfilling the instruction. Output (a) is incomplete since it's a code snippet that doesn't create a function as requested.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it is a well-structured function that accurately and completely follows the instruction, allowing for the generation of a specified number of random numbers.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

She is having a hard time adjusting to her new surroundings and is feeling down in the dumps.\n\n# Output (b):\nA hypothetical situation in which a person is feeling sad could be an unexpected change at work, such as a reduction in pay or loss of a job. It could also be a sudden break-up with a partner or a death in the family. Other common triggers are feeling left out or neglected by friends, or feeling isolated and alone.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGive a helpful response to the following statement: My bag is lost.\n\n# Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried searching for it or notified authorities like the police?\n\n# Output (b):\nI'm sorry to hear about your loss.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) infers the user's need for guidance and offers practical advice, fulfilling the intention behind the statement. Output (b) does not infer any intention beyond acknowledging the loss.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth responses are accurate in their respective roles, with Output (a) providing accurate advice for dealing with a lost bag.\n\n5.

Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

Output (b) only gives the synonym without any additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs fulfill the user's intention of providing a synonym for 'deceptive', but Output (a) adds a level of clarity by explicitly stating it is a match.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) provide accurate synonyms for 'deceptive'.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs precisely answer the question by providing a synonym, but Output (a) provides more context, which is in line with the formal tone of the instruction.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is more comprehensive and informative, making it more suitable for a formal context. Therefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -2.264974000354414e-06}, {".": -2.7418097943154862e-06}, {" Text": -2.9802276912960224e-06}, {" Quality": -7.092700980138034e-05}, {":\n":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs have good text quality, with fluent and well-structured sentences. They are free of spelling and grammatical errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither output provides additional information beyond what is required by the instruction, as they are simply modified versions of the original function.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, which is to modify the function to accept and use two parameters. Both outputs have inferred this correctly.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately execute the modification by accepting two parameters and incorporating them into the greeting.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction by accepting two parameters, 'name' and 'customer', and concatenates them to the greeting. Output (b) also follows the instruction but uses 'name' and 'surname' as the parameters.\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\nBoth outputs effectively modify the function as instructed, but Output (b) is slightly better because it separates the customer's first name and surname, which is more informative and personalized than just using 'name' (Output (a)). This slight difference in context makes Output (b) more user-friendly in a customer service scenario.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -3.576272320060525e-06}, {".":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) presents a clear and straightforward headline, while Output (b) uses sensational language with \"Experts Baffled\" and \"Single Secret,\" which is more clickbait-like.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs are quite concise and don't provide much detail, which is expected for a headline. However, Output (a) implies a more practical approach, suggesting that small changes can make a difference, which might be more informative to readers.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to create a less clickbait headline. Output (a) achieves this by using a more straightforward and less sensational tone, while Output (b) still has elements of clickbait.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth headlines are vague, but Output (a) is less likely to create false expectations, as it doesn't claim to be a \"single secret\" or involve experts being \"baffled.\"\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs have rephrased the original clickbait headline, but Output (a) more successfully avoids clickbait language.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it adheres more closely to the instruction of creating a less clickbait headline, using a more honest and practical tone. Output (b) still contains elements of sensationalism, which goes against the instruction.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -3.4570634852570947e-06}, {".":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) has a well-structured sentence with proper grammar and a clear flow of ideas.

Information Richness:\nBoth outputs are simple sentences and do not provide additional information beyond the required words.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention was to construct a sentence using the given words, which both outputs have accomplished.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth sentences are accurate in their use of the words \"effervescence\", \"hesitant\", and \"integrity\".\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs precisely follow the instruction by incorporating all three words into a sentence.\n\nOverall, Output (a) has a more natural sentence structure and flow, while Output (b) has a less common word placement.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWrite an SQL query to find all words that start with the letter 'd'.\n\n# Output (a):\nSELECT word FROM words WHERE word = 'd';\n\n# Output (b):\nSELECT word FROM table WHERE word LIKE 'd%';\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are fluent and well-structured, with no spelling or grammatical errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither output provides additional information beyond what is required by the instruction.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) only retrieves words that exactly match 'd', which is not what the instruction asks for. Output (b) correctly uses the 'LIKE' operator with 'd%' to retrieve all words starting with 'd'.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) does not fully follow the instruction as it does not retrieve all words starting with 'd'. Output (b) accurately follows the instruction by using the correct pattern matching syntax.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is more accurate and closely follows the instruction, while Output (a) fails to fulfill the task as specified.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nDetermine the most common word in the text. Humans are created in the image of God, from a spiritual perspective and from a physical perspective.\n\n# Output (a):\n\"from\", \"a\", and \"perspective\"\n\n# Output (b):\nThe most common word in the text is \"humans\", which appears twice.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) presents a list of words without punctuation or context, while Output (b) provides a complete sentence.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) simply lists the common words without any context or explanation, while Output (b) gives the context by stating which word is the most common.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs directly answer the question, but Output (b) provides additional context by mentioning the frequency of the word.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) is inaccurate as \"humans\" is not the most common word; \"the\" and \"in\" are also common.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction by listing the most common words, but Output (b) incorrectly identifies the most common word.\n\nOverall, Output (b) has better text quality and provides more context, but its inaccuracy outweighs these advantages.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, and both outputs address it directly by providing the correction.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately identify the error and suggest the correct solution.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs fulfill the instruction by suggesting a correction to the given sentence.\n\nOverall, Output (a) directly provides the corrected sentence, which is more concise and directly answers the instruction.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

It should have a well-organized layout with a consistent color scheme that aligns with the brand's identity. The website should also have a responsive design, meaning it should look good and function well on all devices.\n\nIn terms of feel, the website should be user-friendly and intuitive. The website should also make users feel secure, especially if they're required to enter personal information or make a purchase.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe ideal website content should be engaging, relevant, and tailored to the intended audience. It should offer high-quality, original information that is regularly updated to remain current. Multimedia elements like images, videos, and infographics should complement the text to enhance understanding and retain user interest. Clear, concise language and well-structured formatting, including short paragraphs, bullet points, and subheadings, make the content easily digestible. Above all, the content should provide genuine value to the user, addressing their needs or queries while maintaining authenticity and credibility.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end.

The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Output (b):\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured, fluent, and free of errors. Output (b) provides a more engaging example, which makes it slightly more coherent.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) and Output (b) both cover the main differences in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Output (b) adds context by mentioning the time periods and provides a direct comparison through an example.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in describing the differences between Shakespearean and modern English.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs address the instruction by describing the differences and providing an example.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it not only provides the necessary information but also offers a more engaging and illustrative example, which better fulfills the instruction by demonstrating the differences in a more tangible way.\n\nTherefore, Output (b)

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) follows the instruction more closely by incorporating the requested sarcastic mean girl style throughout the story, while Output (a) focuses more on historical accuracy.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it successfully captures the requested tone and presents the story in a more engaging and creative way, even though it simplifies some historical details.

1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.", "output_2": "Oh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is a simple statement that suggests the next time slot, while Output (b) provides a more descriptive explanation of the code's purpose.\n\n2.

User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) attempts to understand the user's question by inferring that the code is related to a schedule, while Output (a) simply provides a continuation of the time slots without context.\n\n4.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (a):\nThese people can\u2019t be trusted whatsoever, you should make a scene at his school to show people the consequences of their ill behavior.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit?

Maybe submitting a claim would get their attention?", "instruction": "Provide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nSon has a peanut allergy, and the school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts. This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe United States is a linguistically diverse country with over 350 languages spoken. The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured, fluent, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. Output (b) provides a more detailed and coherent flow of ideas, discussing the regional aspects of language usage and the importance of indigenous languages.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) is more information-rich, providing details on the number of languages spoken, the prominence of English as the de facto national language, and the specific languages spoken within immigrant communities. Output (a) only mentions a few languages without going into as much detail.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs fulfill the user's intention of comparing and contrasting languages spoken in the US, but Output (b) does so more comprehensively, including aspects like regional variations and the role of English in daily life.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their information, but Output (b) is more precise, mentioning the number of languages spoken and the percentages of the population that speaks certain languages.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) follows the common requirements of a compare-and-contrast essay more closely by providing a detailed analysis of the languages, their usage, and their cultural significance. Output (a) is more concise and lacks the depth of comparison and contrast.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed comparison of the languages spoken in the United States, fulfilling the requirements of a compare-and-contrast essay more effectively. It offers a clearer picture of the linguistic landscape and the roles of different languages in American society.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -5.125986263010418e-06},

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nDo you know of anyone who was unable to become an engineer despite getting the degree and their best efforts? Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is concise and provides direct advice, while Output (b) is more detailed and structured, offering a comprehensive approach to the situation.\n\n2.

User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) better understands the user's concern and offers relevant advice, while Output (a) focuses more on the interview process.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their advice, but Output (b) covers a wider range of aspects that could be relevant to the user's situation.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs address the instruction by providing advice, but Output (b) offers a more complete and well-rounded response.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it provides a more detailed and well-structured analysis of the situation, offering multiple strategies to address the user's concerns.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

The Earth is surrounded by a gentle glow, emphasizing the importance of preserving our planet's resources.\n\n**Text Positions:**\n1. **Title:** Centered at the top of the poster in bold and vibrant letters:\n   \"Save Electricity, Illuminate Tomorrow\"\n\n2. **Slogan:** Just below the title, in a slightly smaller font:\n   \"Empower Change, Conserve Energy\"\n\n3. **Main Message:** Positioned in the middle of the poster, in a larger font:\n   \"Join the Movement! Be a Watt-saver.\"\n\n4. **Tips for Saving Electricity:** Aligned horizontally across the bottom of the poster, each tip bulleted:\n   - \"Switch off lights when not in use.\"\n   - \"Unplug chargers to prevent energy wastage.\"\n   - \"Use energy-efficient appliances.\"\n   - \"Opt for natural light during the day.\"\n\n\n# Output (b):\nSave Energy: Unplug unwanted electronics. Use energy-saving bulbs. Use natural light whenever possible. Turn off electronics and appliances when not in use. Turn down the thermostat a few degrees. The poster aims to quickly convey the message that individual actions to save electricity today contribute to a brighter and sustainable future for everyone. The split image visually contrasts the choices we make now with the positive outcomes we can achieve. Remember, a successful poster communicates the message clearly and concisely while capturing the viewer's attention. The \"Brighten Tomorrow, Conserve Today\" concept emphasizes the urgency and rewards of energy conservation in a visually impactful way.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs fulfill the instruction by combining the words, but Output (b) adds context, which could be inferred as the user wanting a meaningful sentence.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in combining the words as requested.\n\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide the requested information, which is a list of ten prime numbers sorted from smallest to largest.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) accurately lists the first ten prime numbers, starting with 2, which is the smallest prime number. However, Output (b) omits 2, the smallest prime number, and starts with 5.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction precisely by including the smallest prime number, 2, and listing the next nine primes. Output (b) fails to include the smallest prime number, which is a key part of the instruction.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is more accurate and closely follows the instruction by including the smallest prime number, 2.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

It was a danger that could not be ignored.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe warmth of the fire was comforting, filling the room with a pleasant orange glow. But despite its welcoming warmth, it also presented a danger.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs have good text quality, with fluent and well-structured sentences. Output (b) uses a slightly more varied sentence structure, which adds a bit more interest.\n\n2.

No additional information is needed or expected, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, and both outputs accurately follow this by forming a coherent paragraph. No inference is needed.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in preserving the content of the original sentences.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs successfully combine the sentences into a coherent paragraph, fulfilling the instruction.\n\nOverall, Output (b) has a slightly better text quality due to its varied sentence structure, which makes it more engaging to read.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nName three public figures and their occupation who support renewable energy\n\n# Output (a):\n1.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, environmentalist, and philanthropist.\n\n# Output (b):\nThree public figures who support renewable energy include Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed information about each public figure's occupation, while Output (b) is concise but less informative.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) is more information-rich as it specifies the roles of each individual, such as Al Gore being a climate change advocate and former vice-president, Elon Musk's multiple titles, and Mark Zuckerberg's environmentalist and philanthropic activities. Output (b) only lists their names and the most well-known occupation of Bill Gates.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs directly answer the question without inferring any additional information, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in listing public figures who support renewable energy.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs fulfill the instruction by naming three public figures and their occupations, but Output (a) provides more detail as per the Information Richness criterion.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it provides more detailed and specific information about the public figures and their occupations, which is more informative and helpful to the user

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWhat is an antonym for the word \"cogent\"?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe antonym of the word \"cogent\" is \"irrelevant\".\n\n# Output (b):\nunconvincing\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is straightforward, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs provide accurate antonyms for \"cogent\".\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs answer the question directly, but Output (a) adds a brief explanation, which is not explicitly required but adds more information.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is more informative and provides a clearer understanding of the antonym by giving a brief explanation.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Inflation\n\n# Output (a):\nInflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. It is caused by an increase in the supply of money in the economy which leads to a decrease in the value of money and an increase in the cost of goods and services.\n\n# Output (b):\nInflation is like when you're blowing up a balloon. The more air you put in, the bigger it gets. Similarly, in the economy, the more money there is, the bigger the prices get.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction does not specify a need for historical context, so both outputs infer the user's intention differently. Output (a) focuses on the practical aspect, while Output (b) offers a cultural reference.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their respective contexts.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs address the instruction, but Output (b) provides a more detailed answer.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it offers a more interesting and informative response, providing context to the phrase \"Who wears short shorts?\" that might be unknown to the user.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.", "output_2": "There are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.", "instruction": "I work at a fully remote software company that has multiple, functional departments that work on different projects that span across the organization.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall.

There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events. It is a way pivotal part of many areas of mathematics, science, technology, and more. It is also helpful for simply interacting with other people and the world around us.

Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, and both outputs have fulfilled it by providing a suitable synonym.\n\n4.

The choice between \"charitable\" and \"bountiful\" as a synonym for \"generous\" is subjective, and both words are appropriate in the given context. Therefore, the decision is based on a tie, and I will choose the output that maintains the original meaning of the sentence more closely.\n\n\"Generous\" implies a willingness to give freely, while \"charitable\" often conveys a sense of giving for the benefit of others. \"Bountiful\" suggests an abundance or plentiful supply, which can also convey the idea of generosity.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

They are more efficient than regular cars and produce fewer emissions.\n\n# Output (b):\nConsider taking public transportation or renting a car with fewer emissions when travelling. If you must take a plane, look for an airline with a lower carbon footprint.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Output (b) returns the day of the week as a string, making it more user-friendly.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) assumes the user wants the day of the week in human-readable form, which is a reasonable inference.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate, but Output (b) is more precise in fulfilling the user's likely intention.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) directly follows the instruction by providing the day of the week as an integer, while Output (b) adds an extra step by defining a function, which is not explicitly asked for.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it provides the day of the week in a more understandable format for the user, and it infers the user's likely intention, even though it goes beyond the exact instruction. The added function definition enhances usability.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -6.318072337307967e-06}, {".": -6.794906312279636e-06}, {" Text": -2.861018856492592e-06}, {"

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nAnalyze this sentence:\n\u201cShe didn't shop because she was too tired.\u201d\n\n# Output (a):\nThe sentence means that the person decided not to shop because they lacked the energy to do so. This shows that the person is either too busy or too exhausted to shop, indicating that they may be busy with other activities or just might not have the energy to shop. This sentence also reveals the person's lack of interest in shopping, which could be due to financial or time constraints.\n\n# Output (b):\nThis sentence is an example of an excuse. It suggests that someone did not do something because they were too tired, when in fact there may be other reasons why they did not shop. It could be interpreted as someone trying to avoid responsibility or justify their actions.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are fluent, well-structured, and free of errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a detailed interpretation of the sentence, including possible reasons for the person's fatigue and implications about their interest in shopping. Output (b) offers a different perspective, focusing on the sentence as an excuse and suggesting potential hidden motives.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction is to analyze the sentence, not infer the user's intention. Therefore, this criterion is not applicable to either output.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately analyze the sentence, though they present different interpretations.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs have fully addressed the instruction to analyze the sentence.\n\nOverall, Output (a) provides a more comprehensive analysis by exploring various possible reasons behind the person's fatigue, while Output (b) offers a more critical perspective on the sentence's potential implications. The choice between the two depends on the context and the desired depth of analysis. If a more in-depth exploration of possible scenarios is sought, Output (a) is better. If the focus is on understanding the potential hidden meaning or social dynamics, Output (b) is more suitable.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -3.3378546504536644e-06}, {".":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Going to work outside of the house or office.\n5. Going to a store or other commercial establishment that is located outside. \n6. Leaving the house and coming back inside.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe instruction \"Go outside\" can have different meanings depending on the situation. For example, if a parent tells their child to go outside to play, it can mean leaving the house and going to a nearby park or play area. But if a doctor tells a patient to go outside, it can mean stepping outside of the hospital or clinic for some fresh air and relaxation. In both cases, the literal act of going outside is the same, but the intent behind the instructions can be drastically different.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

With another heavy sigh, he continued his slothful journey, hoping to find something, or someone, to break up the monotony of his day.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe lazy elephant strolled through the jungle, avoiding the other animals by wishing them away with his trumpeting.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nReformat the sentence so it is a question: I was surprised by the outcome.\n\n# Output (a):\nWhat surprised you about the outcome?\n\n# Output (b):\nWhat was most surprising was the outcome.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately rephrase the original sentence into a question.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs precisely follow the instruction by reformulating the sentence into a question.\n\nOverall, both Output (a) and Output (b) effectively execute the task, but Output (a) directly asks a question, which is more in line with the original instruction to reformat the sentence as a question.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGiven a list of numbers and the letter \"a\", sort the list in the following order: All the even numbers followed by \"a\" followed by all the odd numbers.\nList of numbers: 5, 2, 9, 12, 8, 6, a, 11\n\n# Output (a):\n5, 8, 12, 2, 6, 11, a, 9, 1\n\n# Output (b):\n2, 12, 8, 6, a, 5, 9, 11\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are lists of numbers and a letter, so there is no text quality to evaluate.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nThe task does not require any additional information, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly stated, and both outputs have fulfilled it by sorting the numbers according to the given instruction.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) has sorted the list incorrectly, placing the odd number 1 before \"a\". Output (b) has correctly sorted the list with even numbers first, followed by \"a\", and then the odd numbers.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) has followed the instruction precisely, while Output (a) has made an error in the order.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it accurately follows the given instruction, ensuring that all even numbers are sorted first, followed by \"a\", and then the odd numbers. Output (a) fails to adhere to the instruction due to the placement of the number 1.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -7.152531907195225e-06}, {".": -3.576272320060525e-06}, {"

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWhat is the smallest positive integer number that is divisible by 5?\n\n# Output (a):\n5\n\n# Output (b):\n15 is the smallest positive integer number that is divisible by 5.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is accurate, but Output (b) is not, as the smallest positive integer divisible by 5 is 5, not 15.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs precisely answer the question asked.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is more accurate and directly follows the instruction by providing the correct smallest positive integer divisible by 5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

It is redundant.\n2. This sentence contains the word \"redundant\".\n3. Provide three example sentences that use the word \u201credundant\u201d.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) presents three well-structured sentences that use \"redundant\" in different contexts, demonstrating its meaning effectively. Output (b) has incomplete and awkwardly structured sentences.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides rich examples that illustrate the meaning of \"redundant\" in context, while Output (b) lacks context and depth.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) successfully fulfills the instruction by providing relevant example sentences, while Output (b) seems to misunderstand the task, repeating the instruction instead of providing examples.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) accurately uses \"redundant\" in each sentence, reflecting the intended meaning. Output (b) inaccurately represents the task's requirement.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) completely follows the instruction by giving three example sentences, while Output (b) fails to do so, essentially rephrasing the instruction.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it effectively demonstrates the meaning and usage of \"redundant\" in well-structured sentences, accurately follows the instruction, and provides rich information. In contrast, Output (b) is less coherent, less informative, and does not accurately execute the task.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -4.291525328881107e-06}, {".":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

It's the perfect way to unwind and get some exercise.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) assumes the user wants to know where Tom hikes, while Output (b) infers a broader interest in Tom's weekend activities and gets a more detailed response.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in terms of grammar and relevance to the instruction.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction doesn't specify a particular format or content, so both outputs are complete in this aspect.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it not only asks a question but also includes Tom's response, providing more information and a more engaging conversation.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention was to create an original proverb about friendship, and both outputs directly address this.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in conveying the essence of friendship.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to create an original proverb, and they are of similar lengths.\n\nIn this case, both Output (a) and Output (b) are equally effective in fulfilling the task.

In this context, the conciseness and similarity to the original sentence might be preferred.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -3.6954811548639555e-06}, {".":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

This ensures that the most important tasks are processed first.\n\n# Output (b):\nA priority queue can be used in a taxi dispatch system. When a customer requests a taxi, the system needs to determine which taxi to send to the customer to minimize the total journey time for all customers. The taxi with the shortest estimated total journey time can be given the highest priority and served first. The system can serve the taxi with the highest priority first until one is served or the queue is empty.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

The Seahawks' defense had some lapses, allowing the Texans to score 18 points in the second half.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe tone of this article is positive, emphasizing the Seahawks' defense as well as their ability to remain competitive against the Texans' offense. Its strong performance is quite impressive according to this article.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe tone of the article is mostly positive, with an emphasis on Seattle's strong performance in the first half. However, there is a slight tone of frustration in the latter half of the article, with the mention of the Seahawks' \"lapses\" in defense.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I believe in Jesus Christ\n\n# Output (a):\nThe best way to defeat a demon is to use the power of God. Jesus Christ has the authority and power to defeat demons and to set the captive free. The Bible teaches us to pray to God for help in times of trouble, and to seek His will in our lives. God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful. But God is greater than any demon, and He has the power to defeat them. Trust in God and He will help you.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe best way to defeat depression can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their condition. However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, don't hesitate to seek help.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you.

However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nComplete the following sentence: \"Yesterday it was raining, so I put on my ____.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nYesterday it was raining, so I put on my jacket to keep out the rain.\n\n# Output (b):\nYesterday it was raining, so I put on my raincoat.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in describing an appropriate action for rainy weather.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs precisely follow the instruction by completing the sentence without any omissions.\n\nOverall, both Output (a) and Output (b) effectively and accurately fulfill the task. However, Output (b) is more concise and directly focuses on the rain-related clothing item, while Output (a) adds the detail of the jacket's purpose, which, although helpful, is not strictly necessary for the sentence completion.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides the name of the restaurant (Kuma\u2019s Corner) and its address, while Output (b) gives the name (\"elephant + vine\") and address of a restaurant that is actually at the given location. Output (a) seems to be providing information for a nearby restaurant, while Output (b) might be suggesting a restaurant at the same address.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) might be inaccurate as it suggests a restaurant in Chicago, which might not be the nearest one to the given address in Evanston. Output (b) is more accurate as it suggests a restaurant with the same street name, which is likely to be closer.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs have followed the instruction by providing the name and address of a nearby restaurant.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is more accurate in providing information about a restaurant near the given address, even though it's at the same street number. Output (a) might have provided a restaurant that is farther away.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

It is a member of the Felidae family and is closely related to the jaguar. Despite its ferocious reputation, it is actually an extremely shy and elusive creature, typically avoiding contact with humans.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe Panther is a mostly solitary species of mammal found in Central and South America. It is distinguishable by its black-spotted coat and slender, sleek build.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. Output (a) provides a more vivid description, while Output (b) is more concise.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) offers more details about the Panther's behavior and reputation, making it more informative. Output (b) focuses on the Panther's habitat and physical appearance.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to identify the Panther, and both outputs provide relevant information, but Output (a) adds more context about the Panther's nature.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) inaccurately suggests that the Panther is a separate species, as it is actually a term used for melanistic individuals of other big cat species, like jaguars and leopards. Output (b) is more accurate in this regard.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs address the instruction by providing information on how to identify a Panther, but Output (b) is more precise in specifying the black-spotted coat and slender build.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is more accurate and directly addresses the key aspects of identifying a Panther, while Output (a) provides more context but contains an error.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Output (a) uses \"drenched\" and \"pouring\" to convey the intensity of the rain, while Output (b) uses \"soaked\" and \"sudden downpour\" to achieve the same effect.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither output adds extra information, as the task is to rewrite the sentence while keeping its meaning unchanged. Both are equally informative.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, and both outputs have accurately inferred it by rephrasing the original sentence.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs maintain the original meaning of the sentence, describing a situation where someone was caught in heavy rain.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs have successfully rewritten the sentence to be more expressive without altering its meaning.\n\nOverall, both Output (a) and Output (b) effectively
