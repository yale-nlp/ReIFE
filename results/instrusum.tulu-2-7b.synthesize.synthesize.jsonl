Fighting has been going on for almost two weeks, destabilising the populous country in East Africa, with reports of hundreds dead. A power struggle, an election and a push for political reform are among several factors that led to the crisis. Here, we've broken them down to explain how and why this conflict has flared. In simple chunks of 100, 300 and 500 words, this is the story of the crisis so far. The conflict started on 4 November, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray. He said he did so in response to an attack on a military base housing government troops in Tigray. The escalation came after months of feuding between Mr Abiy's government and leaders of Tigray's dominant political party. For almost three decades, the party was at the centre of power, before it was sidelined by Mr Abiy, who took office in 2018 after anti-government protests. Mr Abiy pursued reforms, but when Tigray resisted, a political crisis ensued. The roots of this crisis can be traced to Ethiopia's system of government. Since 1994, Ethiopia has had a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions. Remember that powerful party from Tigray? Well, this party - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - was influential in setting up this system. It was the leader of a four-party coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991, when a military regime was ousted from power. More on the Tigray crisis: Under the coalition, Ethiopia became more prosperous and stable, but concerns were routinely raised about human rights and the level of democracy. Eventually, discontent morphed into protest, leading to a government reshuffle that saw Mr Abiy appointed prime minister. Mr Abiy liberalised politics, set up a new party (the Prosperity Party), and removed key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression. Meanwhile, Mr Abiy ended a long-standing territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019. These moves won Mr Abiy popular acclaim, but caused unease among critics in Tigray. Tigray's leaders see Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralise power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system. The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the central government to hold its own regional election. The central government, which had postponed national elections because of coronavirus, said it was illegal. The rift grew in October, when the central government suspended funding for and cut ties with Tigray. Tigray's administration said this amounted to a \"declaration of war\". Tensions increased. Then, in what the International Crisis Group termed a \"sudden and predictable\" descent into conflict, Mr Abiy said Tigray had crossed a \"red line\". He accused Tigrayan forces of attacking an army base to steal weapons. \"The federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation,\" Mr Abiy said. Ethiopia, Africa's oldest independent country, has undergone sweeping changes since Mr Abiy came to power. A member of the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, Mr Abiy made appeals to political reform, unity and reconciliation in his first speech as prime minister. His agenda was spurred by the demands of protesters who felt Ethiopia's political elite had obstructed the country's transition to democracy. The Tigrayan politicians that led the ruling coalition for 27 years were deemed to be part of the problem. In the 1970s and 1980s their party, the TPLF, fought a war to wrest control of government from a military junta known as the Derg. The party succeeded, becoming a leading member of the coalition government that took power in 1991. The coalition gave autonomy to Ethiopia's regions, but retained a tight grip on central government, with critics accusing it of repressing political opposition. Now the party finds itself in opposition. In 2019, it refused to participate in Mr Abiy's new government and merge with his Prosperity Party. This snub was followed by further escalations. Tigray's decision to hold its own election in September, for example, was an unprecedented act of defiance against the central government. Since then, both governments have designated each other as \"illegitimate\". Tigray argues that the central government has not been tested in a national election since Mr Abiy's appointment as prime minister. Tigray has also called out the prime minister for his \"unprincipled\" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. There has long been animosity between Tigray and the government in Eritrea, which shares a border with the region. A dispute over territory along this border was the cause of a war fought between Ethiopia and Eritrea from 1998 until 2000. You may remember this dispute making headlines in 2018. That year, Mr Abiy signed a peace treaty with Eritrea's government, ending the territorial spat. A year later, Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize. Now it is war, not peace, that is drawing attention to Ethiopia. Thousands of civilians have been displaced since 4 November, when Mr Abiy ordered his military to strike forces in Tigray. Hundreds more are reported to have died, with reports of a civilian massacre. With the communications largely cut in Tigray, the exact number of casualties is not clear. The Ethiopian government has announced a six-month state of emergency in Tigray. A full-blown civil war could last far longer. \"Given the strength of Tigray's security forces, the conflict could well be protracted,\" International Crisis Group, a non-profit organisation, says. \"Tigray has a large paramilitary force and a well-drilled local militia, thought to number perhaps 250,000 troops combined.\" As Africa's second-most populous country, Ethiopia is pivotal to stability in the Horn of Africa. If the conflict intensifies, there are fears it could spill over into neighbouring countries. There have already been reports of missiles fired into Eritrea and 27,000 refugees fleeing to Sudan. There is also a concern that the conflict could exacerbate ethnic tensions elsewhere in Ethiopia.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the main factors that led to the conflict between the Ethiopian government and forces in the Tigray region.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The conflict between the Ethiopian government and forces in the Tigray region stems from several factors, including a power struggle, political reforms, and an election.

By Jane O'BrienBBC News, Washington The Puritans get a bad rap in America - especially when it comes to alcohol. They are generally blamed for putting the dampeners on any form of fun, and many people assume that it was the nation's puritanical roots coming to the surface when Prohibition was introduced in 1917. But while they weren't exactly party animals, a new exhibition at the US National Archives reveals that the Puritans actually approved of drink. \"One of the things we understand now is that the initial ship that came over from England to Massachusetts Bay actually carried more beer than water,\" says Bruce Bustard, senior curator of Spirited Republic: Alcohol in American History. In fact Increase Mather, a prominent Puritan minister of the period, delivered a sermon in which he described alcohol as being \"a good creature of God\" - although the drunkard was \"of the devil.\" Early Americans even took a healthful dram for breakfast, whiskey was a typical lunchtime tipple, ale accompanied supper and the day ended with a nightcap. Continuous imbibing clearly built up a tolerance as most Americans in 1790 consumed an average 5.8 gallons of pure alcohol a year. \"We think of that as an astounding amount - you would think people would be staggering around drunk, but most people were able to handle their alcohol because it was integrated into daily life.\" says Bustard. This was also a period when most people were working in the fields which presumably didn't require much focus. And living in a tight knit community meant people could keep an eye on each other and intervene if somebody was thought to be overdoing it. Even so, modern Americans look quite abstemious by comparison, consuming only two gallons of pure alcohol per year. In 1830, consumption peaked at 7.1 gallons a year and drinking became a moral issue. \"This was a time of great reform fervour,\" says Bustard. \"Think of the women's rights movement and anti-slavery movement. Another very popular and powerful movement was the temperance and ultimately Prohibition movement.\" Alcoholism - also known as dipsomania - was starting to have a serious impact on communities. Women and children might be in physical danger if the man of the house began drinking. If he became ill or lost his job through drink, there was no social safety net to support or protect his family. In 1862 the US Navy abolished the traditional half-pint daily rum ration for sailors, and by the late 19th Century support for Prohibition, banning the manufacture and sale of alcohol was overwhelming. On 16 January 1919, the 18th Amendment, which set Prohibition into law, became part of the Constitution. Many famous figures emerged from the era - the Chicago gangster boss Al Capone being the most notorious. But the National Archives exhibition reveals details of some lesser-known heroes who fought on the side of the law. Isidor \"Izzy\" Einstein was an immigrant from Austria-Hungary who had no experience in law enforcement. Nevertheless, he made his name arresting almost 5,000 people accused of bootlegging, and enjoyed a 95% conviction rate. Drinking Data The Founding Fathers liked a drink - Samuel Adams was a partner in his father's malt house and Thomas Jefferson was famed for importing European wines. By the late 19th Century, dipsomania, or alcoholism, was being treated as a disease. The first arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol was in 1897. In 1955 the first breathalyser was patented. Americans drink an average of 2.3 gallons of pure alcohol a year compared to 7.1 gallons in 1830. He and his partner Moe Smith often worked in disguise but also tipped off reporters in order to get favourable news coverage. That publicity and their lack of professional experience eventually led to both being dismissed. But prohibition did not ban alcohol consumption and many Americans found legal and not so legal ways to carry on drinking. The speakeasy was born, organised crime moved in and alcohol became big business. The cost of enforcing prohibition itself became prohibitive. By the 1930s it was widely believed that making alcohol legal again would provide much needed jobs and taxes during the Great Depression. And on 16 February 1933, the 21st Amendment ended Prohibition. \"America now has a mishmash of local, state and federal controls of alcohol and part of that is a legacy of Prohibition,\" says Bustard. \"The Prohibition movement was still quite strong after Prohibition ended and it led to a lot of local prohibition on alcohol and state level probation.\" The American presidency has done a lot to rehabilitate alcohol and make it respectable again. Betty, the wife of Gerald Ford may have given her name to an alcoholic treatment centre, but Presidents Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama can all be seen on film drinking socially and making official toasts with international dignitaries.

The journey has been fraught with difficulty for prospectors - but it looks like their investment may be about to pay off. By Magnus BennettBBC Scotland News Extracting gold from Cononish, near Tyndrum, in the west of Scotland was never going to be an easy proposition. The technical challenges - and costs - of accessing the precious metal from halfway up a mountain were a daunting prospect for those willing to try. But try they did. Early attempts from the mid-1980s saw prospectors come and go, as they struggled - and failed - to raise sufficient cash for what was always going to be a capital-intensive project. Their efforts to attract backers were also undermined by the volatility of the precious metals market, which often saw gold prices slump. By 2006, the mine had changed hands several times and was up for sale once more. That seemed to spell the end of Cononish and Scotland's hopes of producing its own gold for the first time. However, in 2007, Australian-listed firm Scotgold Resources entered the scene and revived the mine. It has been a rollercoaster ride ever since. By 2013, Scotgold had obtained planning permission and put a funding plan in place, only for the gold price to collapse, making the project less palatable for potential investors. Costs were also spiralling, as the mine had fallen by that point within the boundaries of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park, which meant much more stringent planning and environmental conditions. An earlier application had been turned down due to conservation concerns. The problems were compounded by the fact that Scotgold couldn't raise money from traditional banking sources, given its small-scale nature. That seemed to be that - until Edinburgh-born businessman Nat le Roux arrived on the scene and recapitalised the company in 2014. Since then, he has pumped in millions of pounds of his own money to keep the project alive. Mr le Roux, who is a former independent director of the London Metal Exchange, said there was \"a certain romance\" about the idea of a Scottish gold mine. \"But when the mine was brought to my attention seven years ago, it seemed to me to have interesting investment potential. \"When I came into it, the problem was one of finance. \"By world standards, this is a very small mine. At full production, we will be producing about 2,000 ounces of gold a month. \"At the same time, the amounts of money needed to finance the operation have been quite substantial.\" Scotgold anticipates that over the expected nine-year life of the mine it will cost about \u00a325m in capital expenditure and a further \u00a381m in operating costs. That's a whopping sum - but the owners still stand to make millions if all goes according to plan. Gold prices have soared from as low as \u00a3700 an ounce in 2015 to more than \u00a31,300 today. Scotgold believes it can recover 175,000 ounces in total from Cononish, worth \u00a3236m at current prices. Repeated feasibility studies have also shown gold deposits at Cononish to be high-grade - and its rarity as \"authentic Scottish gold\" has already attracted a premium from buyers. In 2016, the company auctioned off 10 limited edition 1oz fine Scottish gold rounds formed from initial extractions from the mine. They raised an average of more than \u00a34,550 per ounce - a premium of 378% over the then spot price of about \u00a3950. Scotgold chief executive Richard Gray has steered the company through turbulent times in recent years, but describes the team working on the project as \"inherent optimists\". \"There are always issues and problems to overcome but we have this belief that we will overcome them and the mine will be very profitable,\" he says. \"I have always been confident in the merits of the project. \"However, without the support of Scotgold's shareholders to stay the course, there was always a risk in the worst case scenario that the company would be forced to sell the asset to someone who would develop it and subsequently reap the rewards.\" There are still challenges ahead. These include the impact of Covid-19, which forced Scotgold to delay production of first gold earlier this year. The company is looking to increase its workforce from 25 to 70 as production ramps up, but finding the people to handle the highly technical aspects of gold extraction has also proven a problem. Mr Gray explains: \"Expertise is needed and you obviously can't find all the people already existing in the area. Some people will have to come from further afield and hopefully settle nearer by.\" Scotgold expects to produce 10,000oz of gold next year before ramping up production to an average of 23,500oz a year for the rest of the mine's life. Cononish may yet prove to be the start of a golden era for prospectors in Scotland. Scotgold remains optimistic that it will discover extensions to Cononish, which would lengthen the life of the mine. And it has identified potentially significant gold deposits in other areas of Scotland where it holds option agreements with Crown Estates Scotland. Mr le Roux says: \"It is not like Cononish is one fortuitous discovery in the middle of an otherwise barren landscape. \"My view, and that of others, is that we will end up with a number of gold mines in the west of Scotland, either on the same scale as Cononish or perhaps a little bit bigger, assuming the gold price holds up.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the history of the Cononish gold mine in bullet points.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "- Cononish is Scotland's first commercial gold mine.\n- Early attempts to extract gold from the mine in the mid-1980s failed due to lack of funding.\n- In 2007, Scotgold Resources revived the mine, but faced challenges such as collapsing gold prices and stringent planning and environmental conditions.\n- Edinburgh-born businessman Nat le Roux recapitalized the company in 2014 and has invested millions of pounds to keep the project alive.\n- The mine is expected to cost \u00a325m in capital expenditure and \u00a381m in operating costs over its nine-year life.\n- Scotgold anticipates recovering 175,000 ounces of gold worth \u00a3236m at current prices.\n- The mine has high-grade gold deposits and its rarity as \"authentic Scottish gold\" has attracted a premium from buyers.\n- Production was delayed due to Covid-19, but Scotgold expects to produce 10,000oz of gold next year and ramp up production to an average of 23,500oz a year.\n- Scotgold remains optimistic about discovering extensions to Cononish and potentially significant gold deposits in other areas of Scotland.", "output_2": "\u2022 The Cononish gold mine in Scotland has had a long and difficult journey since its first prospectors in the mid-1980s.\n\u2022 Several attempts to raise sufficient funds for the capital-intensive project were unsuccessful due to the volatility of the gold market.\n\u2022 In 2006, the mine was up for sale again, but was revived in 2007 by Australian-listed firm Scotgold Resources.\n\u2022 Planning permission was obtained in 2013, but the gold price collapse made the project less attractive to investors.\n\u2022 Costs were further increased due to the mine falling within the boundaries of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park.\n\u2022 In 2014, Edinburgh-born businessman Nat le Roux recapitalised the company and pumped in millions of his own money to keep the project alive.\n\u2022 Scotgold anticipates that over the expected nine-year life of the mine it will cost about \u00a325m in capital expenditure and a further \u00a381m in operating costs.\n\u2022 Gold prices have since soared from \u00a3700 an ounce in 2015 to more than \u00a31,300 today.\n\u2022 Scotgold believes it can recover 175,000 ounces in total from Cononish, worth \u00a3236m at current prices.\n\u2022 Scotgold is looking to increase its workforce from 25 to 70 as production ramps up.\n\u2022 Scotgold expects to produce 10,000oz of gold next year before ramping up production to an average of 23,500oz a year for the rest of the mine's life.\n\u2022 Scotgold remains optimistic that it will discover extensions to Cononish, and has identified potentially significant gold deposits in other areas of Scotland.", "winner": 1, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}
{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nHealth warnings have been issued for parts of England, as air pollution reaches high levels. So what exactly is the problem, and how serious is it? How bad is the pollution in the UK? By UK standards, air pollution levels are high. The Department of the Environment measures outdoor air pollution on a one-to-10 scale. Parts of north-west Norfolk hit level 10 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, levels were recorded at seven - meaning high - in towns and cities in East Anglia and rural parts of south-east England. Pollution levels of five were reached in London, the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside. What has caused it? The tipping point seems to have been dust from storms in the Sahara. Normally it settles in the countries of southern Europe - Spain, Malta and Greece, for example. However, winds from the south and east have brought the dust to the UK, along with industrial pollution from Europe. And because those weather conditions are stable and not changing, those particles are not being dispersed. But that is only part of the problem. Most air pollution in the UK comes from road transport and residential emissions. What is being measured? Leaving aside the Sahara dust, the pollution is made up of various substances, including nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ammonia. These form particles in the atmosphere. The two most common measurements are particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometres or less, known as PM2.5; and larger particles measuring 10 micrometres, known as PM10. The World Health Organization (WHO) uses PM10 levels to measure pollution, expressed in micrograms per cubic metre. It recommends mean exposure over 24 hours to PM2.5 of no more than 10 micrograms/m3, and to PM10 of no more than 25. PM2.5 particles are thought to be particularly damaging because they are so small, they can penetrate into the deepest parts of the lungs. WHO air quality guidelines Why is the UK doing so badly? Last month, the EU announced it was taking legal action against the UK because it was persistently over the safe limit for air pollution - in particular, levels of nitrogen dioxide. But the UK is not alone - most EU countries struggle to meet the targets, says Martin Adams of the European Environment Agency. In fact, the EU is currently taking action against 17 out of 28 member states with serious air quality problems. EU standards make allowances for natural sources of air pollution, including Saharan dust for Spain and ozone for coastal countries such as the UK. Frank Kelly, professor of Environmental Health at King's College London, puts the blame for the UK's pollution woes squarely on the shift to diesel vehicles over the past 10 years. Six out of 10 cars sold today in the UK are diesels, and these produce a lot of nitrogen dioxide, he says. King's College London air quality monitoring project (London only) How serious a problem is air pollution generally? In all, the WHO says air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths a year around the world. That includes indoor as well as outdoor pollution - typically, smoke from cooking stoves in developing countries. About 80% of deaths related to outdoor pollution are linked to heart disease and strokes, while 14% are due to lung or respiratory diseases, and 6% to cancer, estimates the WHO. But even at times of lower pollution, UK air quality still routinely breaches WHO recommended limits. Even when the air looks clean, it is not. WHO: Air pollution 'killed seven million' According to Joe Hennon, the European Commission's spokesman on pollution, around 30,000 people in the UK die prematurely every year from problems associated with air pollution. He describes it as an \"invisible killer\". \"Air pollution can be carcinogenic,\" he said. \"It also causes all kinds of respiratory problems, heart disease, [and] lung problems\". Some headlines have said the UK's air quality is worse than China - is that true? No, says Professor Kelly. When it comes to bad air quality, Beijing has few rivals. In February, at the height of a severe smog episode, the BBC's Jo Floto, in Beijing, wrote that the air quality in the city was \"so bad it's comparable to living near a forest fire\". The Chinese government has recently begun publishing air quality figures for the major cities, although the accuracy of these is sometimes contested. The US embassy in Beijing runs an air quality monitor and releases updates several times daily. At 21:00 (13:00 GMT) on Wednesday, it measured PM2.5 levels of 87 - more than eight times the WHO 24-hour limit. In February, levels soared to 15 times the WHO limit. Compare that with the UK - in the hour to 16:00 on Wednesday, the highest PM2.5 level recorded by the Department for the Environment was 57, in Rochester, Kent. UK air quality levels (Department for the Environment) What might help cut the air pollution? A change in the weather forecast for the end of the week is expected to bring some relief. When pollution measures soared last month, Paris imposed restrictions, banning cars with even-numbered plates from driving on one day, followed by a ban on odd-numbered plates the following day. The EU Environment Agency is awaiting data on whether the ban had much effect. In any case, London will not be following suit. Mr Hennon says the UK can learn from cities like Amsterdam, where there are traffic restrictions - including speed restrictions on motorways - as well as good public transport links and cycle lanes. But he warns there is no easy answer and a range of measures are needed to tackle the problem. A shift towards less polluting forms of transport will be necessary, believes Prof Kelly. In 10 years' time, diesel vehicles will have been largely replaced by low-emission vehicles.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nHealth warnings have been issued for parts of England, as air pollution reaches high levels. So what exactly is the problem, and how serious is it? How bad is the pollution in the UK? By UK standards, air pollution levels are high. The Department of the Environment measures outdoor air pollution on a one-to-10 scale. Parts of north-west Norfolk hit level 10 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, levels were recorded at seven - meaning high - in towns and cities in East Anglia and rural parts of south-east England. Pollution levels of five were reached in London, the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside. What has caused it? The tipping point seems to have been dust from storms in the Sahara. Normally it settles in the countries of southern Europe - Spain, Malta and Greece, for example. However, winds from the south and east have brought the dust to the UK, along with industrial pollution from Europe. And because those weather conditions are stable and not changing, those particles are not being dispersed. But that is only part of the problem. Most air pollution in the UK comes from road transport and residential emissions. What is being measured? Leaving aside the Sahara dust, the pollution is made up of various substances, including nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ammonia. These form particles in the atmosphere. The two most common measurements are particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometres or less, known as PM2.5; and larger particles measuring 10 micrometres, known as PM10. The World Health Organization (WHO) uses PM10 levels to measure pollution, expressed in micrograms per cubic metre. It recommends mean exposure over 24 hours to PM2.5 of no more than 10 micrograms/m3, and to PM10 of no more than 25. PM2.5 particles are thought to be particularly damaging because they are so small, they can penetrate into the deepest parts of the lungs. WHO air quality guidelines Why is the UK doing so badly? Last month, the EU announced it was taking legal action against the UK because it was persistently over the safe limit for air pollution - in particular, levels of nitrogen dioxide. But the UK is not alone - most EU countries struggle to meet the targets, says Martin Adams of the European Environment Agency. In fact, the EU is currently taking action against 17 out of 28 member states with serious air quality problems. EU standards make allowances for natural sources of air pollution, including Saharan dust for Spain and ozone for coastal countries such as the UK. Frank Kelly, professor of Environmental Health at King's College London, puts the blame for the UK's pollution woes squarely on the shift to diesel vehicles over the past 10 years. Six out of 10 cars sold today in the UK are diesels, and these produce a lot of nitrogen dioxide, he says. King's College London air quality monitoring project (London only) How serious a problem is air pollution generally? In all, the WHO says air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths a year around the world. That includes indoor as well as outdoor pollution - typically, smoke from cooking stoves in developing countries.

So what exactly is the problem, and how serious is it? How bad is the pollution in the UK? By UK standards, air pollution levels are high. The Department of the Environment measures outdoor air pollution on a one-to-10 scale. Parts of north-west Norfolk hit level 10 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, levels were recorded at seven - meaning high - in towns and cities in East Anglia and rural parts of south-east England. Pollution levels of five were reached in London, the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside. What has caused it? The tipping point seems to have been dust from storms in the Sahara. Normally it settles in the countries of southern Europe - Spain, Malta and Greece, for example. However, winds from the south and east have brought the dust to the UK, along with industrial pollution from Europe. And because those weather conditions are stable and not changing, those particles are not being dispersed. But that is only part of the problem. Most air pollution in the UK comes from road transport and residential emissions. What is being measured? Leaving aside the Sahara dust, the pollution is made up of various substances, including nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ammonia. These form particles in the atmosphere. The two most common measurements are particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometres or less, known as PM2.5; and larger particles measuring 10 micrometres, known as PM10. The World Health Organization (WHO) uses PM10 levels to measure pollution, expressed in micrograms per cubic metre. It recommends mean exposure over 24 hours to PM2.5 of no more than 10 micrograms/m3, and to PM10 of no more than 25. PM2.5 particles are thought to be particularly damaging because they are so small, they can penetrate into the deepest parts of the lungs. WHO air quality guidelines Why is the UK doing so badly? Last month, the EU announced it was taking legal action against the UK because it was persistently over the safe limit for air pollution - in particular, levels of nitrogen dioxide. But the UK is not alone - most EU countries struggle to meet the targets, says Martin Adams of the European Environment Agency. In fact, the EU is currently taking action against 17 out of 28 member states with serious air quality problems. EU standards make allowances for natural sources of air pollution, including Saharan dust for Spain and ozone for coastal countries such as the UK. Frank Kelly, professor of Environmental Health at King's College London, puts the blame for the UK's pollution woes squarely on the shift to diesel vehicles over the past 10 years. Six out of 10 cars sold today in the UK are diesels, and these produce a lot of nitrogen dioxide, he says. King's College London air quality monitoring project (London only) How serious a problem is air pollution generally? In all, the WHO says air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths a year around the world. That includes indoor as well as outdoor pollution - typically, smoke from cooking stoves in developing countries. About 80% of deaths related to outdoor pollution are linked to heart disease and strokes, while 14% are due to lung or respiratory diseases, and 6% to cancer, estimates the WHO. But even at times of lower pollution, UK air quality still routinely breaches WHO recommended limits. Even when the air looks clean, it is not. WHO: Air pollution 'killed seven million' According to Joe Hennon, the European Commission's spokesman on pollution, around 30,000 people in the UK die prematurely every year from problems associated with air pollution. He describes it as an \"invisible killer\". \"Air pollution can be carcinogenic,\" he said. \"It also causes all kinds of respiratory problems, heart disease, [and] lung problems\". Some headlines have said the UK's air quality is worse than China - is that true? No, says Professor Kelly. When it comes to bad air quality, Beijing has few rivals. In February, at the height of a severe smog episode, the BBC's Jo Floto, in Beijing, wrote that the air quality in the city was \"so bad it's comparable to living near a forest fire\". The Chinese government has recently begun publishing air quality figures for the major cities, although the accuracy of these is sometimes contested. The US embassy in Beijing runs an air quality monitor and releases updates several times daily. At 21:00 (13:00 GMT) on Wednesday, it measured PM2.5 levels of 87 - more than eight times the WHO 24-hour limit. In February, levels soared to 15 times the WHO limit. Compare that with the UK - in the hour to 16:00 on Wednesday, the highest PM2.5 level recorded by the Department for the Environment was 57, in Rochester, Kent. UK air quality levels (Department for the Environment) What might help cut the air pollution? A change in the weather forecast for the end of the week is expected to bring some relief. When pollution measures soared last month, Paris imposed restrictions, banning cars with even-numbered plates from driving on one day, followed by a ban on odd-numbered plates the following day. The EU Environment Agency is awaiting data on whether the ban had much effect. In any case, London will not be following suit. Mr Hennon says the UK can learn from cities like Amsterdam, where there are traffic restrictions - including speed restrictions on motorways - as well as good public transport links and cycle lanes. But he warns there is no easy answer and a range of measures are needed to tackle the problem. A shift towards less polluting forms of transport will be necessary, believes Prof Kelly. In 10 years' time, diesel vehicles will have been largely replaced by low-emission vehicles.

So what exactly is the problem, and how serious is it? How bad is the pollution in the UK? By UK standards, air pollution levels are high. The Department of the Environment measures outdoor air pollution on a one-to-10 scale. Parts of north-west Norfolk hit level 10 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, levels were recorded at seven - meaning high - in towns and cities in East Anglia and rural parts of south-east England. Pollution levels of five were reached in London, the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside. What has caused it? The tipping point seems to have been dust from storms in the Sahara. Normally it settles in the countries of southern Europe - Spain, Malta and Greece, for example. However, winds from the south and east have brought the dust to the UK, along with industrial pollution from Europe. And because those weather conditions are stable and not changing, those particles are not being dispersed. But that is only part of the problem. Most air pollution in the UK comes from road transport and residential emissions. What is being measured? Leaving aside the Sahara dust, the pollution is made up of various substances, including nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ammonia. These form particles in the atmosphere. The two most common measurements are particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometres or less, known as PM2.5; and larger particles measuring 10 micrometres, known as PM10. The World Health Organization (WHO) uses PM10 levels to measure pollution, expressed in micrograms per cubic metre. It recommends mean exposure over 24 hours to PM2.5 of no more than 10 micrograms/m3, and to PM10 of no more than 25. PM2.5 particles are thought to be particularly damaging because they are so small, they can penetrate into the deepest parts of the lungs. WHO air quality guidelines Why is the UK doing so badly? Last month, the EU announced it was taking legal action against the UK because it was persistently over the safe limit for air pollution - in particular, levels of nitrogen dioxide. But the UK is not alone - most EU countries struggle to meet the targets, says Martin Adams of the European Environment Agency. In fact, the EU is currently taking action against 17 out of 28 member states with serious air quality problems. EU standards make allowances for natural sources of air pollution, including Saharan dust for Spain and ozone for coastal countries such as the UK. Frank Kelly, professor of Environmental Health at King's College London, puts the blame for the UK's pollution woes squarely on the shift to diesel vehicles over the past 10 years. Six out of 10 cars sold today in the UK are diesels, and these produce a lot of nitrogen dioxide, he says. King's College London air quality monitoring project (London only) How serious a problem is air pollution generally? In all, the WHO says air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths a year around the world. That includes indoor as well as outdoor pollution - typically, smoke from cooking stoves in developing countries. About 80% of deaths related to outdoor pollution are linked to heart disease and strokes, while 14% are due to lung or respiratory diseases, and 6% to cancer, estimates the WHO. But even at times of lower pollution, UK air quality still routinely breaches WHO recommended limits. Even when the air looks clean, it is not. WHO: Air pollution 'killed seven million' According to Joe Hennon, the European Commission's spokesman on pollution, around 30,000 people in the UK die prematurely every year from problems associated with air pollution. He describes it as an \"invisible killer\". \"Air pollution can be carcinogenic,\" he said. \"It also causes all kinds of respiratory problems, heart disease, [and] lung problems\". Some headlines have said the UK's air quality is worse than China - is that true? No, says Professor Kelly. When it comes to bad air quality, Beijing has few rivals. In February, at the height of a severe smog episode, the BBC's Jo Floto, in Beijing, wrote that the air quality in the city was \"so bad it's comparable to living near a forest fire\". The Chinese government has recently begun publishing air quality figures for the major cities, although the accuracy of these is sometimes contested. The US embassy in Beijing runs an air quality monitor and releases updates several times daily. At 21:00 (13:00 GMT) on Wednesday, it measured PM2.5 levels of 87 - more than eight times the WHO 24-hour limit. In February, levels soared to 15 times the WHO limit. Compare that with the UK - in the hour to 16:00 on Wednesday, the highest PM2.5 level recorded by the Department for the Environment was 57, in Rochester, Kent. UK air quality levels (Department for the Environment) What might help cut the air pollution? A change in the weather forecast for the end of the week is expected to bring some relief. When pollution measures soared last month, Paris imposed restrictions, banning cars with even-numbered plates from driving on one day, followed by a ban on odd-numbered plates the following day. The EU Environment Agency is awaiting data on whether the ban had much effect. In any case, London will not be following suit. Mr Hennon says the UK can learn from cities like Amsterdam, where there are traffic restrictions - including speed restrictions on motorways - as well as good public transport links and cycle lanes.

So what exactly is the problem, and how serious is it? How bad is the pollution in the UK? By UK standards, air pollution levels are high. The Department of the Environment measures outdoor air pollution on a one-to-10 scale. Parts of north-west Norfolk hit level 10 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, levels were recorded at seven - meaning high - in towns and cities in East Anglia and rural parts of south-east England. Pollution levels of five were reached in London, the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside. What has caused it? The tipping point seems to have been dust from storms in the Sahara. Normally it settles in the countries of southern Europe - Spain, Malta and Greece, for example. However, winds from the south and east have brought the dust to the UK, along with industrial pollution from Europe. And because those weather conditions are stable and not changing, those particles are not being dispersed. But that is only part of the problem. Most air pollution in the UK comes from road transport and residential emissions. What is being measured? Leaving aside the Sahara dust, the pollution is made up of various substances, including nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ammonia. These form particles in the atmosphere. The two most common measurements are particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometres or less, known as PM2.5; and larger particles measuring 10 micrometres, known as PM10. The World Health Organization (WHO) uses PM10 levels to measure pollution, expressed in micrograms per cubic metre. It recommends mean exposure over 24 hours to PM2.5 of no more than 10 micrograms/m3, and to PM10 of no more than 25. PM2.5 particles are thought to be particularly damaging because they are so small, they can penetrate into the deepest parts of the lungs. WHO air quality guidelines Why is the UK doing so badly? Last month, the EU announced it was taking legal action against the UK because it was persistently over the safe limit for air pollution - in particular, levels of nitrogen dioxide. But the UK is not alone - most EU countries struggle to meet the targets, says Martin Adams of the European Environment Agency. In fact, the EU is currently taking action against 17 out of 28 member states with serious air quality problems. EU standards make allowances for natural sources of air pollution, including Saharan dust for Spain and ozone for coastal countries such as the UK. Frank Kelly, professor of Environmental Health at King's College London, puts the blame for the UK's pollution woes squarely on the shift to diesel vehicles over the past 10 years. Six out of 10 cars sold today in the UK are diesels, and these produce a lot of nitrogen dioxide, he says. King's College London air quality monitoring project (London only) How serious a problem is air pollution generally? In all, the WHO says air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths a year around the world. That includes indoor as well as outdoor pollution - typically, smoke from cooking stoves in developing countries. About 80% of deaths related to outdoor pollution are linked to heart disease and strokes, while 14% are due to lung or respiratory diseases, and 6% to cancer, estimates the WHO. But even at times of lower pollution, UK air quality still routinely breaches WHO recommended limits. Even when the air looks clean, it is not. WHO: Air pollution 'killed seven million' According to Joe Hennon, the European Commission's spokesman on pollution, around 30,000 people in the UK die prematurely every year from problems associated with air pollution. He describes it as an \"invisible killer\". \"Air pollution can be carcinogenic,\" he said. \"It also causes all kinds of respiratory problems, heart disease, [and] lung problems\". Some headlines have said the UK's air quality is worse than China - is that true? No, says Professor Kelly. When it comes to bad air quality, Beijing has few rivals. In February, at the height of a severe smog episode, the BBC's Jo Floto, in Beijing, wrote that the air quality in the city was \"so bad it's comparable to living near a forest fire\". The Chinese government has recently begun publishing air quality figures for the major cities, although the accuracy of these is sometimes contested. The US embassy in Beijing runs an air quality monitor and releases updates several times daily. At 21:00 (13:00 GMT) on Wednesday, it measured PM2.5 levels of 87 - more than eight times the WHO 24-hour limit. In February, levels soared to 15 times the WHO limit. Compare that with the UK - in the hour to 16:00 on Wednesday, the highest PM2.5 level recorded by the Department for the Environment was 57, in Rochester, Kent. UK air quality levels (Department for the Environment) What might help cut the air pollution? A change in the weather forecast for the end of the week is expected to bring some relief. When pollution measures soared last month, Paris imposed restrictions, banning cars with even-numbered plates from driving on one day, followed by a ban on odd-numbered plates the following day. The EU Environment Agency is awaiting data on whether the ban had much effect. In any case, London will not be following suit. Mr Hennon says the UK can learn from cities like Amsterdam, where there are traffic restrictions - including speed restrictions on motorways - as well as good public transport links and cycle lanes. But he warns there is no easy answer and a range of measures are needed to tackle the problem. A shift towards less polluting forms of transport will be necessary, believes Prof Kelly. In 10 years' time, diesel vehicles will have been largely replaced by low-emission vehicles.

So what exactly is the problem, and how serious is it? How bad is the pollution in the UK? By UK standards, air pollution levels are high. The Department of the Environment measures outdoor air pollution on a one-to-10 scale. Parts of north-west Norfolk hit level 10 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, levels were recorded at seven - meaning high - in towns and cities in East Anglia and rural parts of south-east England. Pollution levels of five were reached in London, the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside. What has caused it? The tipping point seems to have been dust from storms in the Sahara. Normally it settles in the countries of southern Europe - Spain, Malta and Greece, for example. However, winds from the south and east have brought the dust to the UK, along with industrial pollution from Europe. And because those weather conditions are stable and not changing, those particles are not being dispersed. But that is only part of the problem. Most air pollution in the UK comes from road transport and residential emissions. What is being measured? Leaving aside the Sahara dust, the pollution is made up of various substances, including nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ammonia. These form particles in the atmosphere. The two most common measurements are particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometres or less, known as PM2.5; and larger particles measuring 10 micrometres, known as PM10. The World Health Organization (WHO) uses PM10 levels to measure pollution, expressed in micrograms per cubic metre. It recommends mean exposure over 24 hours to PM2.5 of no more than 10 micrograms/m3, and to PM10 of no more than 25. PM2.5 particles are thought to be particularly damaging because they are so small, they can penetrate into the deepest parts of the lungs. WHO air quality guidelines Why is the UK doing so badly? Last month, the EU announced it was taking legal action against the UK because it was persistently over the safe limit for air pollution - in particular, levels of nitrogen dioxide. But the UK is not alone - most EU countries struggle to meet the targets, says Martin Adams of the European Environment Agency. In fact, the EU is currently taking action against 17 out of 28 member states with serious air quality problems. EU standards make allowances for natural sources of air pollution, including Saharan dust for Spain and ozone for coastal countries such as the UK. Frank Kelly, professor of Environmental Health at King's College London, puts the blame for the UK's pollution woes squarely on the shift to diesel vehicles over the past 10 years. Six out of 10 cars sold today in the UK are diesels, and these produce a lot of nitrogen dioxide, he says. King's College London air quality monitoring project (London only) How serious a problem is air pollution generally? In all, the WHO says air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths a year around the world. That includes indoor as well as outdoor pollution - typically, smoke from cooking stoves in developing countries. About 80% of deaths related to outdoor pollution are linked to heart disease and strokes, while 14% are due to lung or respiratory diseases, and 6% to cancer, estimates the WHO. But even at times of lower pollution, UK air quality still routinely breaches WHO recommended limits. Even when the air looks clean, it is not. WHO: Air pollution 'killed seven million' According to Joe Hennon, the European Commission's spokesman on pollution, around 30,000 people in the UK die prematurely every year from problems associated with air pollution. He describes it as an \"invisible killer\". \"Air pollution can be carcinogenic,\" he said. \"It also causes all kinds of respiratory problems, heart disease, [and] lung problems\". Some headlines have said the UK's air quality is worse than China - is that true? No, says Professor Kelly. When it comes to bad air quality, Beijing has few rivals. In February, at the height of a severe smog episode, the BBC's Jo Floto, in Beijing, wrote that the air quality in the city was \"so bad it's comparable to living near a forest fire\". The Chinese government has recently begun publishing air quality figures for the major cities, although the accuracy of these is sometimes contested. The US embassy in Beijing runs an air quality monitor and releases updates several times daily. At 21:00 (13:00 GMT) on Wednesday, it measured PM2.5 levels of 87 - more than eight times the WHO 24-hour limit. In February, levels soared to 15 times the WHO limit.

But the UK is not alone - most EU countries struggle to meet the targets, says Martin Adams of the European Environment Agency. In fact, the EU is currently taking action against 17 out of 28 member states with serious air quality problems. EU standards make allowances for natural sources of air pollution, including Saharan dust for Spain and ozone for coastal countries such as the UK. Frank Kelly, professor of Environmental Health at King's College London, puts the blame for the UK's pollution woes squarely on the shift to diesel vehicles over the past 10 years. Six out of 10 cars sold today in the UK are diesels, and these produce a lot of nitrogen dioxide, he says. King's College London air quality monitoring project (London only) How serious a problem is air pollution generally? In all, the WHO says air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths a year around the world. That includes indoor as well as outdoor pollution - typically, smoke from cooking stoves in developing countries. About 80% of deaths related to outdoor pollution are linked to heart disease and strokes, while 14% are due to lung or respiratory diseases, and 6% to cancer, estimates the WHO. But even at times of lower pollution, UK air quality still routinely breaches WHO recommended limits. Even when the air looks clean, it is not. WHO: Air pollution 'killed seven million' According to Joe Hennon, the European Commission's spokesman on pollution, around 30,000 people in the UK die prematurely every year from problems associated with air pollution. He describes it as an \"invisible killer\". \"Air pollution can be carcinogenic,\" he said. \"It also causes all kinds of respiratory problems, heart disease, [and] lung problems\". Some headlines have said the UK's air quality is worse than China - is that true? No, says Professor Kelly. When it comes to bad air quality, Beijing has few rivals. In February, at the height of a severe smog episode, the BBC's Jo Floto, in Beijing, wrote that the air quality in the city was \"so bad it's comparable to living near a forest fire\". The Chinese government has recently begun publishing air quality figures for the major cities, although the accuracy of these is sometimes contested. The US embassy in Beijing runs an air quality monitor and releases updates several times daily. At 21:00 (13:00 GMT) on Wednesday, it measured PM2.5 levels of 87 - more than eight times the WHO 24-hour limit. In February, levels soared to 15 times the WHO limit. Compare that with the UK - in the hour to 16:00 on Wednesday, the highest PM2.5 level recorded by the Department for the Environment was 57, in Rochester, Kent. UK air quality levels (Department for the Environment) What might help cut the air pollution? A change in the weather forecast for the end of the week is expected to bring some relief. When pollution measures soared last month, Paris imposed restrictions, banning cars with even-numbered plates from driving on one day, followed by a ban on odd-numbered plates the following day. The EU Environment Agency is awaiting data on whether the ban had much effect. In any case, London will not be following suit. Mr Hennon says the UK can learn from cities like Amsterdam, where there are traffic restrictions - including speed restrictions on motorways - as well as good public transport links and cycle lanes. But he warns there is no easy answer and a range of measures are needed to tackle the problem. A shift towards less polluting forms of transport will be necessary, believes Prof Kelly.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nHealth warnings have been issued for parts of England, as air pollution reaches high levels. So what exactly is the problem, and how serious is it? How bad is the pollution in the UK? By UK standards, air pollution levels are high. The Department of the Environment measures outdoor air pollution on a one-to-10 scale. Parts of north-west Norfolk hit level 10 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, levels were recorded at seven - meaning high - in towns and cities in East Anglia and rural parts of south-east England. Pollution levels of five were reached in London, the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside. What has caused it? The tipping point seems to have been dust from storms in the Sahara. Normally it settles in the countries of southern Europe - Spain, Malta and Greece, for example. However, winds from the south and east have brought the dust to the UK, along with industrial pollution from Europe. And because those weather conditions are stable and not changing, those particles are not being dispersed. But that is only part of the problem. Most air pollution in the UK comes from road transport and residential emissions. What is being measured? Leaving aside the Sahara dust, the pollution is made up of various substances, including nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ammonia. These form particles in the atmosphere. The two most common measurements are particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometres or less, known as PM2.5; and larger particles measuring 10 micrometres, known as PM10. The World Health Organization (WHO) uses PM10 levels to measure pollution, expressed in micrograms per cubic metre. It recommends mean exposure over 24 hours to PM2.5 of no more than 10 micrograms/m3, and to PM10 of no more than 25. PM2.5 particles are thought to be particularly damaging because they are so small, they can penetrate into the deepest parts of the lungs. WHO air quality guidelines Why is the UK doing so badly?

It lies just 5km (three miles) north of the sprawling complex that was once the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. By Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Fukushima, Japan You can see the tall white chimneys of the plant peaking over a low hill. I've been to Namie before. Each time I go back is like the first, so arresting is the scene that confronts you. For three years, time here has stood still. An old wooden house brought down by the earthquake still lies in the middle of a road. Through the broken window of a noodle shop I can see used bowls and chopsticks still lying on tables. I look through the windows of an old people's home. Beds lie unmade; laundry hangs from a drier. It's as if the residents have gone off for breakfast and at any moment they'll be shuffling back in. But no one is coming back. When explosions hit the nuclear plant the pall of radiation was blown right across this town. And so Namie remains utterly deserted, its residents scattered far and wide. In their exile they live in constant fear and anxiety. Fear of what the radiation may have done to their children and anxiety that they will never get their old lives back. 'Need to be sure' At a private hospital 60km from the plant I meet Miyuki Arakawa and her two little boys, five-year-old Ryota and three-year-old Haruto. The boys are changing in to hospital pyjamas. They giggle with the nurses. They've done all this before; it's no longer frightening. But it is for their mother. In a narrow room Haruto climbs in to a large blue machine that looks a bit like a bath. The big blue bathtub is the world's first and only infant full-body radiation scanner. Inside Haruto begins to fidget as the data starts to show on a nearby computer screen. \"After the Chernobyl disaster children were diagnosed many years later,\" Miyuki said. \"My boys may be fine now, but if there is any risk I need to find out as soon as possible.\" Her anxiety level has been raised further by the latest government findings. Since 2011 Japan has surveyed 260,000 Fukushima children. So far 33 cases of thyroid cancer have been confirmed; another 42 are suspected. \"The government gives us very little information,\" she said. \"I need to be completely sure my boys are fine. I want this hospital to follow up next year and the following year and the one after that.\" 'Not related' Look up \"Fukushima thyroid cancer\" on the internet and you will find a legion of horror stories, predictions that thousands of Fukushima children will get cancer. It's little wonder parents like Miyuki are scared. But should they be? At Fukushima University Medical School Professor Shinichi Suzuki leads the team studying the children of Fukushima. A cheerful round-faced man with a grey moustache, Prof Suzuki is frustrated by the constant likening of Fukushima to Chernobyl. \"The first thing to understand is that the amount of radiation released from Fukushima was much lower than at Chernobyl,\" he said. \"Second, the number of children in Fukushima who got a radiation dose above 50 millisieverts is very few, maybe as low as zero.\" In other words the highest level of exposure children at Fukushima are thought to have received (50 millisieverts) is at the very lowest end of exposure for children in Chernobyl. In that case how does Professor Suzuki explain the 33 confirmed cases of thyroid cancer his team have found? \"In Japan there has never been a survey on this scale done before,\" he said. \"Once you start using very sensitive equipment to check for thyroid cancer in a very large group of children then you will inevitably find an increase in the number of cases. That is why we are seeing the increase now. These cases are not related to the nuclear disaster.\" Prof Suzuki says his team will need to carry on their work for many more years to be sure that the children of Fukushima are in the clear. But he and other experts now say they think there will be very few, or even zero, extra childhood cancers because of Fukushima. 'Took everything' That does not mean that the Fukushima disaster is not taking lives. According to the government's own figures, in the last three years more than 1,600 Fukushima evacuees have died from causes that are \"related to the disaster\" On a freezing March morning I meet 56-year-old Hideko Takeda at a grave yard a few kilometres from the little town of Namie. She has come to burn incense on her father's grave. The black marble is still shiny and new. She has a photograph of him with her. He was tall for a Japanese farmer and at 80 still robust. Each day he still milked the cows and tended his fields. But then the disaster stuck and he was forced to flee, leaving his cows to starve to death in their shed. It broke him, Mrs Takeda says; his health collapsed, within two years he was dead. \"I blame the power company [Tepco] for his death,\" she said. \"They took everything from him, his dreams, his hope. They took his land and scattered his family far from home. Nothing will ever bring those back.\" There is also growing evidence of an increase in suicides among Fukushima evacuees. Mrs Takeda says she knows of several from the villages around her farm. \"One man I know went back to check his house,\" she said. \"When he didn't return his family went to find him. His car was parked outside. He had hanged himself. I think he'd given up, he couldn't see any future.\" So far no one has died from radiation in Fukushima. But unable to return to their homes, scattered in evacuations centres, perhaps lonely and depressed, a growing number of evacuees are dying from anxiety, from suicide or from simply losing the will to live.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize Professor Suzuki's opinions.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "Professor Shinichi Suzuki from Fukushima University Medical School believes that the number of thyroid cancer cases found in children after the Fukushima disaster is not related to the nuclear incident.

By Gabriella MulliganTechnology of Business reporter In Ghana, for example, only 10% of smallholder farmers have any kind of certificate documenting their ownership rights. Not only does this put them in a vulnerable position, it can often lead to disputes. And if your land is the main asset you want to borrow against, getting a loan can prove difficult, too. So tech company Landmapp has come up with an innovative mobile platform that uses GPS location functionality to map and survey smallholder farmers. Farmers receive a certified plan of the land and land tenure documentation signed by the surveyor, chiefs and high court. \"Land tenure insecurity is a core barrier to land investment and farming,\" explains Thomas Vaassen, Landmapp's co-founder and chief technical officer. \"Without proper documentation, there is a real risk of losing the rights to a land parcel. Also, without documentation it is often not possible to access financing, as the document is the only collateral at hand for most farmers.\" The company started operations in Ghana earlier this year and has already completed more than 1,000 land maps. It says 80% of traditional chiefs are interested in the service. Smart contracts Disputes can also occur between farmers and food companies who buy their produce. These arrangements have traditionally relied on a large element of trust on both sides. But sometimes producers don't get paid when food companies think farmers haven't delivered what they promised. So Freshmarte for Provenance has developed a mobile app that enables food companies and farmers to operate digital smart contracts based on blockchain, the technology underpinning the Bitcoin digital currency. These contracts are recorded in an encrypted, decentralised ledger that cannot be tampered with, so there can be no dispute about the agreements or whether the terms have been fulfilled or not. The app integrates satellite imagery to monitor the progress of farming projects. And following harvest, the price of produce is fairly determined by an algorithm. The tech has other uses, too. Freshmarte is based on open data, allowing anyone to view the source of the products being sold. Buyers can be sure that no child labour was used, for example, or that producers are receiving a fair wage. \"Our platform, with independent open data APIs [application programming interfaces], allows any concerned individual to research how, when, where, under which labour conditions, and price in respect to trade, the food on their table was grown, packaged, transported and delivered,\" explains founder Job Oyebisi. The app is currently being trialled in southern Nigeria by British American Tobacco, and goes live country-wide in November. A problem shared Of course, it's not just hi-tech solutions helping farmers. Lo-tech phones have given them better access to live market prices, weather forecasts, and, crucially, advice for many years now. One company, WeFarm, operates a peer-to-peer knowledge exchange service via SMS text message, allowing farmers to ask questions of other farmers. Its algorithm routes the question to the most relevant farmers, based on their location and expertise, for example. When Ugandan farmer Erick Beinenama's chickens were dying from coccidiosis, he turned to WeFarm in a bid to save them. Another chicken farmer saw his SMS, gave him advice, and Mr Beinenama managed to save his remaining 23 chickens. \"With farming, you need knowledge from other farmers for better yields,\" he says. \"Without the information from WeFarm, I would have lost all of my chickens.\" Each farmer receives on average three to five answers within a couple of hours, and often farmers from other countries begin sending in advice within 24 hours. Until now, rural farmers typically relied on government field officers for assistance if they had a problem with their crops or livestock. Visits to rural villages from these officers are often only once a month - enough time for all of a farmer's animals to die, or their crops to fail. \"Technology opens up lots of opportunities, whether that is solving a problem on their farm, finding a market for produce, or being able to enhance their resilience to climate change,\" says Kenny Ewan, WeFarm's founder and chief executive. \"These small differences can make a huge impact on smallholders' livelihoods.\" Finance for farming In the meantime, improving farmers' access to financial services - and financial security - also needs to be a priority for technical innovation, says Ross Baird, chief executive of investment and business training organisation, Village Capital. With around 33 million small farms producing up to 90% of Africa's entire agricultural output, Mr Baird argues it is important to help farmers build their wealth and achieve financial security. Nearly two-thirds of the rural population in sub-Saharan Africa live on less than $1.25 (95p) a day. \"Low-cost smartphones have given farmers access to financial services they never had before. But other tools, such as access to credit, savings, investments, and income-smoothing mechanisms require data that is currently too expensive for the plans that farmers have,\" Mr Baird says. Village Capital recently ran a business accelerator in East Africa focusing on these challenges. He says Africa needs better infrastructure, and preferably free internet, if farmers are to benefit fully from new technology. \"Ultimately, we will be successful when we see the average farmer earn a living wage and have financial security,\" he says.

These arrangements have traditionally relied on a large element of trust on both sides. But sometimes producers don't get paid when food companies think farmers haven't delivered what they promised. So Freshmarte for Provenance has developed a mobile app that enables food companies and farmers to operate digital smart contracts based on blockchain, the technology underpinning the Bitcoin digital currency. These contracts are recorded in an encrypted, decentralised ledger that cannot be tampered with, so there can be no dispute about the agreements or whether the terms have been fulfilled or not. The app integrates satellite imagery to monitor the progress of farming projects. And following harvest, the price of produce is fairly determined by an algorithm. The tech has other uses, too. Freshmarte is based on open data, allowing anyone to view the source of the products being sold. Buyers can be sure that no child labour was used, for example, or that producers are receiving a fair wage. \"Our platform, with independent open data APIs [application programming interfaces], allows any concerned individual to research how, when, where, under which labour conditions, and price in respect to trade, the food on their table was grown, packaged, transported and delivered,\" explains founder Job Oyebisi. The app is currently being trialled in southern Nigeria by British American Tobacco, and goes live country-wide in November. A problem shared Of course, it's not just hi-tech solutions helping farmers. Lo-tech phones have given them better access to live market prices, weather forecasts, and, crucially, advice for many years now. One company, WeFarm, operates a peer-to-peer knowledge exchange service via SMS text message, allowing farmers to ask questions of other farmers. Its algorithm routes the question to the most relevant farmers, based on their location and expertise, for example. When Ugandan farmer Erick Beinenama's chickens were dying from coccidiosis, he turned to WeFarm in a bid to save them. Another chicken farmer saw his SMS, gave him advice, and Mr Beinenama managed to save his remaining 23 chickens. \"With farming, you need knowledge from other farmers for better yields,\" he says. \"Without the information from WeFarm, I would have lost all of my chickens.\" Each farmer receives on average three to five answers within a couple of hours, and often farmers from other countries begin sending in advice within 24 hours. Until now, rural farmers typically relied on government field officers for assistance if they had a problem with their crops or livestock. Visits to rural villages from these officers are often only once a month - enough time for all of a farmer's animals to die, or their crops to fail. \"Technology opens up lots of opportunities, whether that is solving a problem on their farm, finding a market for produce, or being able to enhance their resilience to climate change,\" says Kenny Ewan, WeFarm's founder and chief executive. \"These small differences can make a huge impact on smallholders' livelihoods.\" Finance for farming In the meantime, improving farmers' access to financial services - and financial security - also needs to be a priority for technical innovation, says Ross Baird, chief executive of investment and business training organisation, Village Capital. With around 33 million small farms producing up to 90% of Africa's entire agricultural output, Mr Baird argues it is important to help farmers build their wealth and achieve financial security. Nearly two-thirds of the rural population in sub-Saharan Africa live on less than $1.25 (95p) a day. \"Low-cost smartphones have given farmers access to financial services they never had before. But other tools, such as access to credit, savings, investments, and income-smoothing mechanisms require data that is currently too expensive for the plans that farmers have,\" Mr Baird says. Village Capital recently ran a business accelerator in East Africa focusing on these challenges. He says Africa needs better infrastructure, and preferably free internet, if farmers are to benefit fully from new technology. \"Ultimately, we will be successful when we see the average farmer earn a living wage and have financial security,\" he says.

By Zoe MurphyBBC News He is one of a only handful of people to have survived Tuol Sleng prison, code-named S-21 - the regime's interrogation centre and site of torture and mass murder. Last year, from behind bullet-proof glass in a Phnom Penh courtroom, Chum Mey finally told his story to the world. He was a leading witness in the first trial of a senior Khmer Rouge figure, Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Comrade Duch. Duch was the head of Tuol Sleng, were as many as 17,000 men, women and children were detained and then killed. Chum Mey's testimony to the United Nations-backed court could perhaps help bring them a degree of long-delayed justice. Forced exodus In 1975, Chum Mey - originally from Prey Veng province - was working in Phnom Penh as a mechanic. He was married with three young children. Cambodia at that time was in political turmoil, with the leaders of a 1970 military coup locked in civil war against Pol Pot's forces. On 17 April 1975 the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh. \"When they entered everybody including myself raised a white flag to congratulate them; everybody cheered,\" Chum Mey told the war crimes tribunal. Just hours later, Khmer Rouge representatives went door-to-door telling people to evacuate to the countryside. Chum Mey said those who did not co-operate were shot dead. He gathered his wife and children and joined the exodus. His two-year-old son fell ill and died during the journey. Chum Mey was forced to bury him in a shallow grave and move on. Later, he was sent back to the capital by the Khmer Rouge to repair sewing machines for a co-operative manufacturing the new revolutionary uniform, black pyjamas. On 28 October 1978 he and other workers were told they were being sent to fix vehicles for an offensive against Vietnam. In reality, Chum Mey was about to enter the darkest period of his life, as he was taken to Tuol Sleng. Conspirator There he was imprisoned in a brick cell about two metres by one metre wide, blind-folded and shackled to the floor. For 12 days and nights, Chum Mey says he was tortured, as his interrogators tried to make him confess to spying for the US and Russia. \"If you refuse to confess I'll beat you to death. You must tell the truth then I won't kill you. If not I must kill you,\" he quoted his tormentors as saying. He was whipped repeatedly about the body with a switch of bamboo sticks. When he held up his hands to try to shield himself his fingers were broken. His toenails were pulled out with pliers while his legs were shackled. When he still refused to confess, the nails were twisted and pulled off his other foot. Finally, Chum Mey said he was subjected to electric shocks several times with a wire from a 220-volt wall socket. On each occasion he passed out. When he came round, he was asked again to confess. Eventually he said he confessed to anything so that the torture would be over. In his confession Chum Mey wrote that he was working for the CIA and had recruited dozens of agents in Cambodia. He gave the names of dozens of acquaintances, innocent men and women who, it is presumed, were later arrested, tortured and murdered. \"People who had been arrested and killed previously had implicated me, and I implicated others. So did other people. \"It was just like rear waves pushing the front waves forward. So people would die one after another, after another, after another,\" he said in a BBC interview in 2002. Further tragedy Chum Mey believes he was allowed to live because he was of use to the regime, fixing sewing machines in the prison workshop. At night he was chained to a long iron bar with 40 other prisoners. He says they were forced to live in silence. \"When I wept I could not make any noise. I wept a lot and I had no more tears to weep, I was only waiting for the day that I would be killed,\" he later told the war crimes trial. On 7 January 1979, Vietnamese troops captured Phnom Penh from the Khmer Rouge, and the prison staff fled. Chum Mey was marched at gunpoint by prison guards into the provinces, where he had a chance meeting with his wife, and held for the first time his fourth child - a boy, just two months old. For two days they travelled together to an isolated area with a group of other prisoners. They were then ordered to walk into a paddy field, where their captors opened fire on them. The soldiers shot dead his wife and baby. Chum Mey escaped alone and hid in a forest. Justice \"I cry every night. Every time I hear people talk about the Khmer Rouge it reminds me of my wife and children,\" Chum Mey told the public gallery at Duch's trial. He has said that only the court can help to \"wash away\" his suffering. Last year he was elected as the head of the newly-formed Association of Victims of the Khmer Rouge Regime. Speaking to the BBC just weeks before the verdict, Chum Mey said he hoped Duch would be sentenced to life in prison. But he said he felt cheated by the court, which he said seemed to place most of the responsibility for crimes committed on those perpetrators already dead, rather than focusing on the accused. Although the trial has not brought closure for Cambodians, he told the BBC's Guy De Launey he was satisfied that a judicial system was now in place. Most days Chum Mey can be found at the former prison, which is now a genocide museum, housing the photographs and written confessions of many of the victims. \"I come every day to tell the world the truth about the Tuol Sleng prison... so that none of these crimes are ever repeated anywhere in the world.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the experiences of Chum Mey in the 1970s with a timeline.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "Chum Mey was a Cambodian mechanic who was living in Phnom Penh in 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took over the city.

Forced exodus In 1975, Chum Mey - originally from Prey Veng province - was working in Phnom Penh as a mechanic. He was married with three young children. Cambodia at that time was in political turmoil, with the leaders of a 1970 military coup locked in civil war against Pol Pot's forces. On 17 April 1975 the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh. \"When they entered everybody including myself raised a white flag to congratulate them; everybody cheered,\" Chum Mey told the war crimes tribunal. Just hours later, Khmer Rouge representatives went door-to-door telling people to evacuate to the countryside. Chum Mey said those who did not co-operate were shot dead. He gathered his wife and children and joined the exodus. His two-year-old son fell ill and died during the journey. Chum Mey was forced to bury him in a shallow grave and move on. Later, he was sent back to the capital by the Khmer Rouge to repair sewing machines for a co-operative manufacturing the new revolutionary uniform, black pyjamas. On 28 October 1978 he and other workers were told they were being sent to fix vehicles for an offensive against Vietnam. In reality, Chum Mey was about to enter the darkest period of his life, as he was taken to Tuol Sleng. Conspirator There he was imprisoned in a brick cell about two metres by one metre wide, blind-folded and shackled to the floor. For 12 days and nights, Chum Mey says he was tortured, as his interrogators tried to make him confess to spying for the US and Russia. \"If you refuse to confess I'll beat you to death. You must tell the truth then I won't kill you. If not I must kill you,\" he quoted his tormentors as saying. He was whipped repeatedly about the body with a switch of bamboo sticks. When he held up his hands to try to shield himself his fingers were broken. His toenails were pulled out with pliers while his legs were shackled. When he still refused to confess, the nails were twisted and pulled off his other foot. Finally, Chum Mey said he was subjected to electric shocks several times with a wire from a 220-volt wall socket. On each occasion he passed out. When he came round, he was asked again to confess. Eventually he said he confessed to anything so that the torture would be over. In his confession Chum Mey wrote that he was working for the CIA and had recruited dozens of agents in Cambodia. He gave the names of dozens of acquaintances, innocent men and women who, it is presumed, were later arrested, tortured and murdered. \"People who had been arrested and killed previously had implicated me, and I implicated others. So did other people. \"It was just like rear waves pushing the front waves forward. So people would die one after another, after another, after another,\" he said in a BBC interview in 2002. Further tragedy Chum Mey believes he was allowed to live because he was of use to the regime, fixing sewing machines in the prison workshop. At night he was chained to a long iron bar with 40 other prisoners. He says they were forced to live in silence. \"When I wept I could not make any noise. I wept a lot and I had no more tears to weep, I was only waiting for the day that I would be killed,\" he later told the war crimes trial. On 7 January 1979, Vietnamese troops captured Phnom Penh from the Khmer Rouge, and the prison staff fled. Chum Mey was marched at gunpoint by prison guards into the provinces, where he had a chance meeting with his wife, and held for the first time his fourth child - a boy, just two months old. For two days they travelled together to an isolated area with a group of other prisoners. They were then ordered to walk into a paddy field, where their captors opened fire on them. The soldiers shot dead his wife and baby. Chum Mey escaped alone and hid in a forest. Justice \"I cry every night. Every time I hear people talk about the Khmer Rouge it reminds me of my wife and children,\" Chum Mey told the public gallery at Duch's trial. He has said that only the court can help to \"wash away\" his suffering. Last year he was elected as the head of the newly-formed Association of Victims of the Khmer Rouge Regime. Speaking to the BBC just weeks before the verdict, Chum Mey said he hoped Duch would be sentenced to life in prison. But he said he felt cheated by the court, which he said seemed to place most of the responsibility for crimes committed on those perpetrators already dead, rather than focusing on the accused. Although the trial has not brought closure for Cambodians, he told the BBC's Guy De Launey he was satisfied that a judicial system was now in place.

Every time I hear people talk about the Khmer Rouge it reminds me of my wife and children,\" Chum Mey told the public gallery at Duch's trial. He has said that only the court can help to \"wash away\" his suffering. Last year he was elected as the head of the newly-formed Association of Victims of the Khmer Rouge Regime. Speaking to the BBC just weeks before the verdict, Chum Mey said he hoped Duch would be sentenced to life in prison. But he said he felt cheated by the court, which he said seemed to place most of the responsibility for crimes committed on those perpetrators already dead, rather than focusing on the accused. Although the trial has not brought closure for Cambodians, he told the BBC's Guy De Launey he was satisfied that a judicial system was now in place. Most days Chum Mey can be found at the former prison, which is now a genocide museum, housing the photographs and written confessions of many of the victims. \"I come every day to tell the world the truth about the Tuol Sleng prison... so that none of these crimes are ever repeated anywhere in the world.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the experiences of Chum Mey in the 1970s with a timeline.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "In 1975, Chum Mey was working as a mechanic in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and was married with three young children. On April 17, 1975, the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh, and Chum Mey and his family were forced to evacuate to the countryside. During the journey, his two-year-old son fell ill and died. Later, Chum Mey was sent back to the capital to repair sewing machines for the Khmer Rouge. On October 28, 1978, he was taken to Tuol Sleng prison, where he was imprisoned, blindfolded, and shackled to the floor. For 12 days and nights, Chum Mey was tortured until he eventually confessed to spying for the US and Russia. He was allowed to live because of his usefulness in fixing sewing machines in the prison workshop. On January 7, 1979, Vietnamese troops captured Phnom Penh, and Chum Mey was marched at gunpoint into the provinces, where he was reunited with his wife and met his fourth child. Two days later, his wife and baby were shot dead by soldiers, and Chum Mey escaped alone. In 2009, Chum Mey testified at the trial of Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Comrade Duch, the head of Tuol Sleng prison.", "output_2": "In 1975, Chum Mey was working in Phnom Penh as a mechanic and was married with three young children.

You can see them but your brain cannot process the information - you don't know whether they are smiling, or understand their emotions. By Gabriela TorresBBC Mundo health reporter That is what happened to David Bromley, after he suffered a brain injury that left him with face blindness. David has prosopagnosia. People with this condition can see the eyes, the nose, and the mouth, what is known as the context - but they cannot see them as a whole. They do not recognise gestures or emotions. \"I can even recognise my wife if I walk into the house and know that she is there,\" says David. \"But if I'm in the street and she passes by and I don't know that she is going to be there, I wouldn't recognise her.\" David, who lives in Essex, had unknowingly been living with eye damage since birth - the arteries and veins were mixed up. This eventually caused a partial loss of sight and damage in the brain which caused the prosopagnosia. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of this condition is that people do not notice right away that something is wrong with them. 'Social embarrassment' He remembers when he realised there was a problem. \"I went to a reunion where I saw friends that I hadn't seen for 30 years. We were pretty close but we went our separate ways.\" On the way home, he told his brother-in-law: \"'Fran and Mickey haven't changed a bit, they are exactly the same!'. And then I said 'hold on, were they wearing tank tops?'\" What David was seeing was his memory of their friends back then. \"My brain was telling me that there they were and what they looked like, but that wasn't the reality\". After that, he discovered he was face blind. There are two main forms of prosopagnosia; developmental - where people fail to develop face processing abilities which is thought to affect around 2% of the population, and acquired, which develops after some form of brain injury and is much rarer. Dr Ashok Jansari, a cognitive neuropsychology expert from the University of East London said: \"Acquired prosopagnosia is extremely rare because the type of brain damage is very specific,. \"It can be caused by damage to the back of the brain on the right-hand side in an area known generally as the right occipito-temporal region.\" David said: \"I don't know what's worse - not being able to ever recognise people or at 56 years old - as it happened to me - suddenly not being able to recognise anybody\". He added that the worst part is the social embarrassment. \"We were on holiday in Cuba and I'd been snorkelling in the sea.

Even though her prosopagnosia is mild - she can recognise people she knew before her illness - she would rather not let people know because she does not want anyone to think she has some sort of incapacity. \"Life with prosopagnosia is very shameful,\" she says. She is teacher and at work almost nobody knows that she is face blind. \"If I see someone every day, I can recognise them. But if one of the children says hi to me on the street, I would know it is a student from the school, but I wouldn't know who. \"I don't say anything to the children, I just work every day to learn their faces.\" But she says: \"Perhaps the reason why I don't mention it is because I don't want them to think that I cannot do my job, because that's not true.

This condition has no cure. \"In the case of acquired prosopagnosia, once a part of the brain is damaged it is not going to 'grow' back, so it is impossible to fix the problem,\" he said. \"With developmental prosopagnosia, we don't know what causes it, but hypothetically in the future if they find that there is a genetic cause, that could be corrected - but that would be a very long way off.\" Even though people develop strategies to cope - because people change their appearance, they are not foolproof.

Meena (her name has been changed on request) is a 45-year-old domestic worker in the southern city of Bangalore. And she is a survivor of sexual harassment in the workplace. She cooks and cleans in three different homes, earning around 6,000 rupees ($84; $64) a month. She used to earn nearly three times as much. But she lost her job in several homes after she accused one of her employers of sexually harassing her. Meena said the harassment started after she borrowed 100,000 rupees for her older daughter's wedding from a couple in their early 70s. She had been working in their house for three years by then. She alleged the man would initially try and brush past her while she was sweeping or mopping the floor. Sometimes, she said, he would try and touch her casually or even tug on her sari. His wife, Meena said, was often asleep and didn't seem to know about her husband's inappropriate behaviour. Meena said she tried to resist his advances. But one evening his wife locked herself in the bedroom and went to sleep. That day, she alleged, he grabbed her and tried to pull her onto the sofa. Despite his age he was strong she said, but fortunately not stronger than her. She managed to push him away, and flee the house never to return. Meena did not file a police complaint because she assumed no-one would believe her. But then the couple started pressurising her to return the money she had borrowed, failing which they wanted her to return to work to pay off her debt. At first, they threatened her over the phone. Then, she alleged, they sent men to her home to intimidate her. The wife also blamed her for dressing \"provocatively\" and \"tempting\" her husband. Meena said she was scared, depressed and did not know what to do. She could not pay off her debt in full and returning to work in their home was not an option. In one of the other houses that she worked in, she felt comfortable enough to share her experience. This employer put her in touch with a domestic workers' union and another organisation that works on violence against women in Bangalore. The union representative spoke to the elderly couple and threatened police action if they did not stop harassing Meena. Meena had some money saved and decided to use it to pay off as much of the debt as she could. Her tribulations ended but she still struggles. Her daughter suffers from cerebral palsy and needs constant care, so she spends a significant portion of her savings taking her to school every day because she can't walk by herself. She is entitled to a disability allowance from the government but the payments are not regular. The incident also scarred Meena - she had nightmares, was afraid to take a job near the home of her previous employers and experienced shame and guilt. Informal workers like Meena - women employed as domestic workers, construction labour, garment workers and vendors - make up 94% of India's female workforce. But their experiences of sexual harassment or assault rarely come to light. And data is also hard to come by - scattered surveys of female workers in different parts of the country tell an incomplete but important story. Read more about the #MeToo movement in India A 2012 study by Oxfam of formal and informal workers in eight Indian cities showed that 17% of women were sexually harassed at work - the most vulnerable being female labourers (29%) and domestic workers (23%). A survey of domestic workers in 2018 in and around India's capital, Delhi, found that 29% of them were sexually harassed at work. These figures are low compared to studies from the formal sector where rates of reported harassment range from 88% in the BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) sector to 57% in the health sector. But this is because given their economic and social vulnerability, informal workers are less likely to report offences. Even if they do, these cases may never lead to justice for the victims because they may be eventually withdrawn fearing reprisals. There have been a few cases that have grabbed national attention. In 2017 for instance, domestic workers and their families stormed a posh apartment complex in Delhi alleging that a domestic worker had been beaten up by her employers; in 2011, a Bollywood actor was convicted for raping his maid. But these examples are few and far between. The #MeToo movement in India, which was preceded by LoSha (a crowd sourced list of Indian male academics who allegedly harassed students or colleagues), has named several high-profile figures, including filmmakers, actors, artists and journalists. But the face of #MeToo - both in India and globally - has been an urban, educated, articulate and privileged woman; the experiences of marginalised women are notably absent. While some of the more critical voices have pointed to the fact that Dalit (formerly known as untouchables) women and poor women have been left out of this movement, these voices have remained on the fringe. This is ironic because it was the gang rape of a Dalit development worker, Bhanwari Devi, in Rajasthan state that led to India's first law against sexual harassment at the workplace. India's sexual harassment laws mandate that in the absence of organisations, a Local Complaints Committee (LCC) headed by a district magistrate should address these complaints. But most cities or districts have no such committees. The #MeToo movement in India has several supporters with social, economic and cultural capital and has now found a voice in mainstream media. But we are yet to see them aligning closely with informal workers' rights groups. It is time for us to move from #MeToo to #UsAll.

Meena said the harassment started after she borrowed 100,000 rupees for her older daughter's wedding from a couple in their early 70s. She had been working in their house for three years by then. She alleged the man would initially try and brush past her while she was sweeping or mopping the floor. Sometimes, she said, he would try and touch her casually or even tug on her sari. His wife, Meena said, was often asleep and didn't seem to know about her husband's inappropriate behaviour. Meena said she tried to resist his advances. But one evening his wife locked herself in the bedroom and went to sleep. That day, she alleged, he grabbed her and tried to pull her onto the sofa. Despite his age he was strong she said, but fortunately not stronger than her. She managed to push him away, and flee the house never to return. Meena did not file a police complaint because she assumed no-one would believe her. But then the couple started pressurising her to return the money she had borrowed, failing which they wanted her to return to work to pay off her debt. At first, they threatened her over the phone. Then, she alleged, they sent men to her home to intimidate her. The wife also blamed her for dressing \"provocatively\" and \"tempting\" her husband. Meena said she was scared, depressed and did not know what to do. She could not pay off her debt in full and returning to work in their home was not an option. In one of the other houses that she worked in, she felt comfortable enough to share her experience. This employer put her in touch with a domestic workers' union and another organisation that works on violence against women in Bangalore. The union representative spoke to the elderly couple and threatened police action if they did not stop harassing Meena. Meena had some money saved and decided to use it to pay off as much of the debt as she could. Her tribulations ended but she still struggles. Her daughter suffers from cerebral palsy and needs constant care, so she spends a significant portion of her savings taking her to school every day because she can't walk by herself. She is entitled to a disability allowance from the government but the payments are not regular. The incident also scarred Meena - she had nightmares, was afraid to take a job near the home of her previous employers and experienced shame and guilt. Informal workers like Meena - women employed as domestic workers, construction labour, garment workers and vendors - make up 94% of India's female workforce. But their experiences of sexual harassment or assault rarely come to light. And data is also hard to come by - scattered surveys of female workers in different parts of the country tell an incomplete but important story. Read more about the #MeToo movement in India A 2012 study by Oxfam of formal and informal workers in eight Indian cities showed that 17% of women were sexually harassed at work - the most vulnerable being female labourers (29%) and domestic workers (23%). A survey of domestic workers in 2018 in and around India's capital, Delhi, found that 29% of them were sexually harassed at work. These figures are low compared to studies from the formal sector where rates of reported harassment range from 88% in the BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) sector to 57% in the health sector. But this is because given their economic and social vulnerability, informal workers are less likely to report offences. Even if they do, these cases may never lead to justice for the victims because they may be eventually withdrawn fearing reprisals. There have been a few cases that have grabbed national attention. In 2017 for instance, domestic workers and their families stormed a posh apartment complex in Delhi alleging that a domestic worker had been beaten up by her employers; in 2011, a Bollywood actor was convicted for raping his maid. But these examples are few and far between. The #MeToo movement in India, which was preceded by LoSha (a crowd sourced list of Indian male academics who allegedly harassed students or colleagues), has named several high-profile figures, including filmmakers, actors, artists and journalists. But the face of #MeToo - both in India and globally - has been an urban, educated, articulate and privileged woman; the experiences of marginalised women are notably absent. While some of the more critical voices have pointed to the fact that Dalit (formerly known as untouchables) women and poor women have been left out of this movement, these voices have remained on the fringe. This is ironic because it was the gang rape of a Dalit development worker, Bhanwari Devi, in Rajasthan state that led to India's first law against sexual harassment at the workplace. India's sexual harassment laws mandate that in the absence of organisations, a Local Complaints Committee (LCC) headed by a district magistrate should address these complaints. But most cities or districts have no such committees. The #MeToo movement in India has several supporters with social, economic and cultural capital and has now found a voice in mainstream media. But we are yet to see them aligning closely with informal workers' rights groups. It is time for us to move from #MeToo to #UsAll.

Meena (her name has been changed on request) is a 45-year-old domestic worker in the southern city of Bangalore. And she is a survivor of sexual harassment in the workplace. She cooks and cleans in three different homes, earning around 6,000 rupees ($84; $64) a month. She used to earn nearly three times as much. But she lost her job in several homes after she accused one of her employers of sexually harassing her. Meena said the harassment started after she borrowed 100,000 rupees for her older daughter's wedding from a couple in their early 70s. She had been working in their house for three years by then. She alleged the man would initially try and brush past her while she was sweeping or mopping the floor. Sometimes, she said, he would try and touch her casually or even tug on her sari. His wife, Meena said, was often asleep and didn't seem to know about her husband's inappropriate behaviour. Meena said she tried to resist his advances. But one evening his wife locked herself in the bedroom and went to sleep. That day, she alleged, he grabbed her and tried to pull her onto the sofa. Despite his age he was strong she said, but fortunately not stronger than her. She managed to push him away, and flee the house never to return. Meena did not file a police complaint because she assumed no-one would believe her. But then the couple started pressurising her to return the money she had borrowed, failing which they wanted her to return to work to pay off her debt. At first, they threatened her over the phone. Then, she alleged, they sent men to her home to intimidate her. The wife also blamed her for dressing \"provocatively\" and \"tempting\" her husband. Meena said she was scared, depressed and did not know what to do. She could not pay off her debt in full and returning to work in their home was not an option. In one of the other houses that she worked in, she felt comfortable enough to share her experience. This employer put her in touch with a domestic workers' union and another organisation that works on violence against women in Bangalore. The union representative spoke to the elderly couple and threatened police action if they did not stop harassing Meena. Meena had some money saved and decided to use it to pay off as much of the debt as she could. Her tribulations ended but she still struggles. Her daughter suffers from cerebral palsy and needs constant care, so she spends a significant portion of her savings taking her to school every day because she can't walk by herself. She is entitled to a disability allowance from the government but the payments are not regular. The incident also scarred Meena - she had nightmares, was afraid to take a job near the home of her previous employers and experienced shame and guilt. Informal workers like Meena - women employed as domestic workers, construction labour, garment workers and vendors - make up 94% of India's female workforce. But their experiences of sexual harassment or assault rarely come to light. And data is also hard to come by - scattered surveys of female workers in different parts of the country tell an incomplete but important story. Read more about the #MeToo movement in India A 2012 study by Oxfam of formal and informal workers in eight Indian cities showed that 17% of women were sexually harassed at work - the most vulnerable being female labourers (29%) and domestic workers (23%). A survey of domestic workers in 2018 in and around India's capital, Delhi, found that 29% of them were sexually harassed at work. These figures are low compared to studies from the formal sector where rates of reported harassment range from 88% in the BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) sector to 57% in the health sector. But this is because given their economic and social vulnerability, informal workers are less likely to report offences. Even if they do, these cases may never lead to justice for the victims because they may be eventually withdrawn fearing reprisals. There have been a few cases that have grabbed national attention. In 2017 for instance, domestic workers and their families stormed a posh apartment complex in Delhi alleging that a domestic worker had been beaten up by her employers; in 2011, a Bollywood actor was convicted for raping his maid. But these examples are few and far between. The #MeToo movement in India, which was preceded by LoSha (a crowd sourced list of Indian male academics who allegedly harassed students or colleagues), has named several high-profile figures, including filmmakers, actors, artists and journalists. But the face of #MeToo - both in India and globally - has been an urban, educated, articulate and privileged woman; the experiences of marginalised women are notably absent. While some of the more critical voices have pointed to the fact that Dalit (formerly known as untouchables) women and poor women have been left out of this movement, these voices have remained on the fringe. This is ironic because it was the gang rape of a Dalit development worker, Bhanwari Devi, in Rajasthan state that led to India's first law against sexual harassment at the workplace. India's sexual harassment laws mandate that in the absence of organisations, a Local Complaints Committee (LCC) headed by a district magistrate should address these complaints. But most cities or districts have no such committees. The #MeToo movement in India has several supporters with social, economic and cultural capital and has now found a voice in mainstream media. But we are yet to see them aligning closely with informal workers' rights groups. It is time for us to move from #MeToo to #UsAll.

And data is also hard to come by - scattered surveys of female workers in different parts of the country tell an incomplete but important story. Read more about the #MeToo movement in India A 2012 study by Oxfam of formal and informal workers in eight Indian cities showed that 17% of women were sexually harassed at work - the most vulnerable being female labourers (29%) and domestic workers (23%). A survey of domestic workers in 2018 in and around India's capital, Delhi, found that 29% of them were sexually harassed at work. These figures are low compared to studies from the formal sector where rates of reported harassment range from 88% in the BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) sector to 57% in the health sector. But this is because given their economic and social vulnerability, informal workers are less likely to report offences. Even if they do, these cases may never lead to justice for the victims because they may be eventually withdrawn fearing reprisals. There have been a few cases that have grabbed national attention. In 2017 for instance, domestic workers and their families stormed a posh apartment complex in Delhi alleging that a domestic worker had been beaten up by her employers; in 2011, a Bollywood actor was convicted for raping his maid. But these examples are few and far between. The #MeToo movement in India, which was preceded by LoSha (a crowd sourced list of Indian male academics who allegedly harassed students or colleagues), has named several high-profile figures, including filmmakers, actors, artists and journalists. But the face of #MeToo - both in India and globally - has been an urban, educated, articulate and privileged woman; the experiences of marginalised women are notably absent. While some of the more critical voices have pointed to the fact that Dalit (formerly known as untouchables) women and poor women have been left out of this movement, these voices have remained on the fringe. This is ironic because it was the gang rape of a Dalit development worker, Bhanwari Devi, in Rajasthan state that led to India's first law against sexual harassment at the workplace. India's sexual harassment laws mandate that in the absence of organisations, a Local Complaints Committee (LCC) headed by a district magistrate should address these complaints. But most cities or districts have no such committees. The #MeToo movement in India has several supporters with social, economic and cultural capital and has now found a voice in mainstream media.

Meena (her name has been changed on request) is a 45-year-old domestic worker in the southern city of Bangalore. And she is a survivor of sexual harassment in the workplace. She cooks and cleans in three different homes, earning around 6,000 rupees ($84; $64) a month. She used to earn nearly three times as much. But she lost her job in several homes after she accused one of her employers of sexually harassing her. Meena said the harassment started after she borrowed 100,000 rupees for her older daughter's wedding from a couple in their early 70s. She had been working in their house for three years by then. She alleged the man would initially try and brush past her while she was sweeping or mopping the floor. Sometimes, she said, he would try and touch her casually or even tug on her sari. His wife, Meena said, was often asleep and didn't seem to know about her husband's inappropriate behaviour. Meena said she tried to resist his advances. But one evening his wife locked herself in the bedroom and went to sleep. That day, she alleged, he grabbed her and tried to pull her onto the sofa. Despite his age he was strong she said, but fortunately not stronger than her. She managed to push him away, and flee the house never to return. Meena did not file a police complaint because she assumed no-one would believe her. But then the couple started pressurising her to return the money she had borrowed, failing which they wanted her to return to work to pay off her debt. At first, they threatened her over the phone. Then, she alleged, they sent men to her home to intimidate her. The wife also blamed her for dressing \"provocatively\" and \"tempting\" her husband. Meena said she was scared, depressed and did not know what to do. She could not pay off her debt in full and returning to work in their home was not an option. In one of the other houses that she worked in, she felt comfortable enough to share her experience. This employer put her in touch with a domestic workers' union and another organisation that works on violence against women in Bangalore. The union representative spoke to the elderly couple and threatened police action if they did not stop harassing Meena. Meena had some money saved and decided to use it to pay off as much of the debt as she could. Her tribulations ended but she still struggles. Her daughter suffers from cerebral palsy and needs constant care, so she spends a significant portion of her savings taking her to school every day because she can't walk by herself. She is entitled to a disability allowance from the government but the payments are not regular. The incident also scarred Meena - she had nightmares, was afraid to take a job near the home of her previous employers and experienced shame and guilt. Informal workers like Meena - women employed as domestic workers, construction labour, garment workers and vendors - make up 94% of India's female workforce. But their experiences of sexual harassment or assault rarely come to light.

Yet one pleasure denied even the biggest Shakespeare fanatic will be to watch his work in a theatre which he wrote for or acted in. In London, no purpose-built theatres survive from his day. Where did they all go? By Vincent DowdBBC World Service Peter Sillitoe strides into New Inn Broadway, London EC2, aware that for a theatre-lover disappointment is about to follow. Nonetheless, he's used to explaining why this unloved little street in Shoreditch is vital to the history of drama. He's the perfect person to tour London's Shakespeare sites with. For two years Sillitoe worked on the ShaLT (Shakespearean London Theatres) project. It pulled together existing research about the playhouses of London during Shakespeare's career as a writer (roughly 1588 to 1612). From 1576 the street in Shoreditch was home to The Theatre, the first purpose-built home for drama in Britain since Roman times. As a hungry young actor, Shakespeare made his home there after moving from Warwickshire to London. \"Until that point performances were mainly in grand private homes or in taverns,\" says Sillitoe. \"There was just no concept of a theatre being a building in its own right. \"From the 1570s that started to change - possibly because London was growing, and there were more people demanding intelligent entertainment.\" Even the word theatre, as opposed to playhouse, may have evoked comparison with Greek and Roman culture. Sillitoe taps the shabby grey hoardings on New Inn Broadway which mask The Theatre's foundations, uncovered in 2008. \"Some scholars believe this may have been where Romeo and Juliet was first performed. \"It's not an easy connection to make these days, but I encourage people to use their mind's eye and conceive of how this area was when Shakespeare was a young man.\" Today, a new 235-seat theatre is proposed as part of the site's redevelopment. A year after The Theatre opened came The Curtain, built about 100 yards to the south. Three years ago, part of the Curtain's foundations were located during excavation work. Now a major redevelopment has been approved by Hackney Council that will include a permanent display of the Curtain's foundations. Sillitoe says there is increasing pressure to rebuild this part of London. \"The area went untouched for decades, but now we're discovering more about what lies beneath. \"Though I'm not sure much of what's going up will evoke the England of the 16th and early 17th Centuries.\" So he suggests a side trip to investigate where Shakespeare lived while he wrote. From the early 1600s, the writer lodged with a refugee Huguenot family in Silver Street, Cripplegate - now part of the Barbican. It is possible that while there he wrote King Lear and Macbeth. Legal documents mean we know more about his time in Silver Street than at any other London address. But Silver Street, like the theatres of Shoreditch, has effectively disappeared. The closest we get is the massive underground car park which lurks beneath London Wall on the same spot. Not inappropriately, hidden at its far end, is a chunk of London wall which may have stood close to where Shakespeare lodged. \"It's not much,\" admits Sillitoe. \"But outside of Stratford-upon-Avon it's the closest we get to anywhere Shakespeare slept and ate. It's frustrating.\" In 1599 Shakespeare's theatre group, the Chamberlain's Men, abandoned Shoreditch and headed south of the river to establish the Globe theatre. The site is just down river of where Southwark Bridge now stands. It is not to be confused with the reconstructed Shakespeare's Globe a few minutes away. Those who run the new theatre, opened in 1997, have always made clear it's not on the exact site of the original Globe, though many visitors assume otherwise. The location of the original Globe, off Park Street, was identified only in the late 1980s. Today it is indicated by a large plaque in the cobbles. Peter Sillitoe laments that the site, almost inevitably, is now a car park. \"At least this one isn't underground,\" he says. Almost opposite stand the far more extensive remains of The Rose, opened before the Globe in 1587. In 1989 the foundations were deliberately flooded to keep them from crumbling in the air. \"Maybe it's inevitable,\" Sillitoe continues, \"but Sam Wanamaker made such a success of Shakespeare's Globe that The Rose has sometimes been a bit forgotten. \"The Rose is a fascinating place and more intact than the sites north of the Thames. It's worth visiting and gives you a sense of what it must have been like in Shakespeare's time.\" It is thought The Rose played host to Titus Andronicus, one of Shakespeare's earliest plays. But Peter Sillitoe gives a warning: \"Academics debate endlessly where individual plays were acted, but the truth is the companies played wherever was available. \"Hamlet or King Lear didn't settle down for a nice six-month run somewhere. Actors were more like wandering minstrels.\" Any theatre fan would love to be able to walk into The Theatre or The Curtain or The Rose. \"But they were all destroyed, says Sillitoe. \"Partly by Puritan distaste for theatre in the 1640s, and then by the Great Fire of 1666. Later came World War II bombing and, I'm afraid, an indifference to the buildings' fate generally.\" To finish the tour, Peter Sillitoe takes me to Shakespeare's Globe. It is filled with visitors. \"No one really predicted it, but the success of a well-researched reconstruction like this has been a massive help to something like the ShaLT project,\" he says. \"A whole new public interest arose which simply hadn't been there. \"Compare today to where we were 30 years ago. We know a lot more about The Theatre and The Curtain and excavation has at least begun there. What survives of The Rose is open to view, and the public has taken Shakespeare's Globe to its heart in a way no one expected. \"The negative is that we don't have a Shakespearean theatre functioning on its exact original site. Probably we never will. \"But William Shakespeare would be amazed at what we can learn about his world all these centuries later, just by walking around London for three or four hours and taking careful note.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the information about the theatres mentioned in this article.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The article discusses the various theatres associated with William Shakespeare, including The Theatre, The Curtain, and The Rose.

Sillitoe taps the shabby grey hoardings on New Inn Broadway which mask The Theatre's foundations, uncovered in 2008. \"Some scholars believe this may have been where Romeo and Juliet was first performed. \"It's not an easy connection to make these days, but I encourage people to use their mind's eye and conceive of how this area was when Shakespeare was a young man.\" Today, a new 235-seat theatre is proposed as part of the site's redevelopment. A year after The Theatre opened came The Curtain, built about 100 yards to the south. Three years ago, part of the Curtain's foundations were located during excavation work. Now a major redevelopment has been approved by Hackney Council that will include a permanent display of the Curtain's foundations. Sillitoe says there is increasing pressure to rebuild this part of London. \"The area went untouched for decades, but now we're discovering more about what lies beneath. \"Though I'm not sure much of what's going up will evoke the England of the 16th and early 17th Centuries.\" So he suggests a side trip to investigate where Shakespeare lived while he wrote. From the early 1600s, the writer lodged with a refugee Huguenot family in Silver Street, Cripplegate - now part of the Barbican. It is possible that while there he wrote King Lear and Macbeth. Legal documents mean we know more about his time in Silver Street than at any other London address. But Silver Street, like the theatres of Shoreditch, has effectively disappeared. The closest we get is the massive underground car park which lurks beneath London Wall on the same spot. Not inappropriately, hidden at its far end, is a chunk of London wall which may have stood close to where Shakespeare lodged. \"It's not much,\" admits Sillitoe. \"But outside of Stratford-upon-Avon it's the closest we get to anywhere Shakespeare slept and ate. It's frustrating.\" In 1599 Shakespeare's theatre group, the Chamberlain's Men, abandoned Shoreditch and headed south of the river to establish the Globe theatre. The site is just down river of where Southwark Bridge now stands. It is not to be confused with the reconstructed Shakespeare's Globe a few minutes away. Those who run the new theatre, opened in 1997, have always made clear it's not on the exact site of the original Globe, though many visitors assume otherwise. The location of the original Globe, off Park Street, was identified only in the late 1980s. Today it is indicated by a large plaque in the cobbles. Peter Sillitoe laments that the site, almost inevitably, is now a car park. \"At least this one isn't underground,\" he says. Almost opposite stand the far more extensive remains of The Rose, opened before the Globe in 1587. In 1989 the foundations were deliberately flooded to keep them from crumbling in the air. \"Maybe it's inevitable,\" Sillitoe continues, \"but Sam Wanamaker made such a success of Shakespeare's Globe that The Rose has sometimes been a bit forgotten. \"The Rose is a fascinating place and more intact than the sites north of the Thames. It's worth visiting and gives you a sense of what it must have been like in Shakespeare's time.\" It is thought The Rose played host to Titus Andronicus, one of Shakespeare's earliest plays. But Peter Sillitoe gives a warning: \"Academics debate endlessly where individual plays were acted, but the truth is the companies played wherever was available. \"Hamlet or King Lear didn't settle down for a nice six-month run somewhere. Actors were more like wandering minstrels.\" Any theatre fan would love to be able to walk into The Theatre or The Curtain or The Rose. \"But they were all destroyed, says Sillitoe. \"Partly by Puritan distaste for theatre in the 1640s, and then by the Great Fire of 1666.

Later came World War II bombing and, I'm afraid, an indifference to the buildings' fate generally.\" To finish the tour, Peter Sillitoe takes me to Shakespeare's Globe. It is filled with visitors. \"No one really predicted it, but the success of a well-researched reconstruction like this has been a massive help to something like the ShaLT project,\" he says. \"A whole new public interest arose which simply hadn't been there. \"Compare today to where we were 30 years ago. We know a lot more about The Theatre and The Curtain and excavation has at least begun there. What survives of The Rose is open to view, and the public has taken Shakespeare's Globe to its heart in a way no one expected. \"The negative is that we don't have a Shakespearean theatre functioning on its exact original site. Probably we never will. \"But William Shakespeare would be amazed at what we can learn about his world all these centuries later, just by walking around London for three or four hours and taking careful note.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the information about the old London theatres in a timeline as mentioned in this article.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The first purpose-built theatre in Britain since Roman times, The Theatre, was built in Shoreditch in 1576.

By Emma HallettBBC News Born in Lockdown is the result of a writing project set up by Bristol novelist Emylia Hall, the founder of creative writing course Mothership Writers. \"The coronavirus pandemic has intensified what is already a challenging time, making the need for self-expression ever more vital,\" Mrs Hall said. \"The idea was to encourage writing for pleasure and purpose... and, together, to tell the story of what it was like to become a new mum in 2020.\" The mums were asked to write in fragments, each comprising of no more than a handful of sentences or 50 words, that could be scribbled during a night-feed or recorded as a voice note. 'Tears streamed' Mrs Hall said: \"They captured moments and emotions that were so raw, affecting, and inspiring, my tears streamed as I saved each one.\" She initially thought she would need around 20 mums to contribute, but as word spread, she ended up with 277 authors from across the UK. \"One of my favourite lines in our book is 'the very thing keeping you apart right now will one day bond you together'. \"Born in Lockdown was made in exactly that spirit,\" she said. Roxy Afzal, from Manchester, said the project gave her the chance to \"be really honest, but without moaning\". The 37-year-old had every reason to think 2020 would be one of the happiest years of her life with her first baby due in May. But the neonatal nurse found her pregnancy, birth and maternity leave all heavily impacted by the pandemic, with her baby shower cancelled, shops closed, and then in October, losing her father to Covid. \"We were really looking forward to being parents. I was looking forward to maternity leave, we were ready for it,\" she said. \"It really feels like I have been robbed.

Two months later, her father - who had not yet met his grandson - died. She said that \"tipped her over\" and she is now receiving treatment for postnatal depression. Born in Lockdown has given her an outlet to think about the best and worst moments of the last year, she added. For Lisa Bywater, writing is her way of \"capturing\" her life and having something to leave behind.

She gave birth to her daughter Connie six weeks prematurely in January. The 37 year-old, from Forest Hill in London, was then faced with leaving her tiny baby in intensive care so she could start her cancer treatment. \"I was only about three or four days postpartum so you've got all those emotions going through you and I was sat in the waiting room with all these seriously ill people and I was suddenly confronted with this thought that this is really serious,\" she said. 'Humbling' Mrs Bywater stated chemotherapy a month before the March lockdown. As the year went on, she found herself attending chemotherapy alone as restrictions tightened. She said: \"There was that feeling of very much being alone. Just having no-one to turn to at all.\" The former bookseller was alerted to Born in Lockdown via an online expectant mothers group. \"I felt like I had things I wanted to say, but no idea how to find the time between nappy changes and hospital appointments to start saying them, but this project seemed really manageable,\" she said. \"I still have a lot to process from a year, and counting, of parenting and being a cancer patient during a pandemic, but being part of this amazing project has been cathartic, inspirational and humbling.\" Tessa Wills describes herself as \"an older, single, queer, parent by choice\". She said she enjoyed feeling part of a collective voice in this time of isolation. \"It just creates these really precious memories and this is a phenomenal thing to be living through,\" she said. \"There is definitely going to be a lot of reflection on it afterwards, culturally, so it is really important to be trying to write right now and capturing it.\" 'Unflinchingly honest' The 43-year-old lives in Mark, Somerset, and gave birth to her second baby, Juniper Star, in October.

Desperate to get more young people on side and to be seen to be pro-business, the main political parties are all over apprenticeships. So as the Conservatives hail plans to create 16,000 new apprenticeships and Labour respond with a promise for better careers advice for teens, we take a look at what the parties have to offer in terms of jobs and training. One thing that's worth noting before we start. Although apprenticeships are often billed as being a solution to youth unemployment, nearly 40% of those who enrolled in England in 2013/14 were actually over 25. Conservatives On Thursday David Cameron highlighted plans by firms to create 16,000 new apprenticeships, with a promise to create an extra three million 'training places' if the party remains in power after the general election in May. They want to pay for it with money saved from benefits caps. Baroness Brady, a Tory peer and star of The Apprentice (fittingly enough), said the party wants apprenticeships to be held on par with degrees. That's important, because although the number of apprentices has soared under the coalition, Labour has claimed many of those training programmes weren't high enough quality, being 'intermediate level' (equal to five GCSE passes), rather than 'higher level' (equivalent to two A-levels). Labour Labour has pledged to create 80,000 more apprenticeships. However, 33,000 of those would come from just one project, the High Speed 2 rail line (HS2). That raises questions about what will happen once that project is complete, or if it suffers any delays. Ed Miliband has promised apprenticeships to every school leaver who \"gets the grades\" - that's level 3 qualifications, which are equivalent to having two A-levels. Those with two A-Levels will also qualify, but the scheme will exclude those who only have GCSEs. The party has also announced plans to boost job prospects for young people by giving teenagers face-to-face advice in schools. That will include steering people towards more apprenticeships, rather than directing them towards university or unskilled jobs. The scheme has been budgeted at \u00a350m. Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg has pledged to expand apprenticeships and develop national colleges for vocational skills. He wants to end the \"barely concealed snobbery\" about apprenticeships, which he claims comes from adults, rather than young people. The Lib Dems have gone to great lengths to point out the two million apprenticeships available under the coalition, stating that he and Vince Cable have been instrumental in pushing for them. The party told Newsbeat it wants to double that number in the next parliament. UKIP UKIP has pledged to introduce an option for students to take an apprenticeship (with a qualification at the end) instead of four non-core GCSE subjects. The employers they work with will be qualified to test and grade the apprentices, and the students can carry on working with them through their A-levels. The party has also promised to scrap the target of 50% of school leavers going on to university, while scrapping tuition fees for some students taking degrees in high-demand vocational subjects like maths, technology, engineering, medicine and science - so long as they live, work and pay taxes in the UK for five years after they graduate. Green Party The Green Party hasn't published a specific policy on apprenticeships, but told Newsbeat: \"[We] would expand apprenticeships by increasing funding. \"We would ensure the government provides an apprenticeship to all qualified young people aged 16-25 who do not have one and want one. \"{We would implement] a qualifications framework that would allow a real choice of academic and vocational areas, or a mixture of both. \"With students encouraged to have an understanding of a wide range of subjects, and allowed to pursue areas where their talents lie, they will have the best possible start to their careers.\" SNP The SNP has pledged to provide 125,000 \"modern\" apprenticeships in the next parliament, while also promising that every 16 to 19-year-old in the country who's out of work or training will be offered a place on a training or learning scheme. The party has broken this down into at least 30,000 new apprenticeships every year, with a specific campaign on getting more women into vocational training. \"The SNP has been determined to do all that we can to encourage greater equality and ensure that there should be no industry or sector where women cannot build careers that are every bit as successful as their male counterparts.\" The party has suggested it wants as many of the new jobs as possible to be in emerging high-tech industries such as renewable energy and life sciences. Plaid Cymru Plaid has pledged to support the European Union's Youth Jobs Guarantee that will provide training or employment to any young person under 25 who has been out of work for more than four months in an effort, they say, to tackle the root of youth unemployment. They want to promote higher level apprenticeships and in-work learning, both for young people and adults. So there you have it.

Green Party The Green Party hasn't published a specific policy on apprenticeships, but told Newsbeat: \"[We] would expand apprenticeships by increasing funding. \"We would ensure the government provides an apprenticeship to all qualified young people aged 16-25 who do not have one and want one. \"{We would implement] a qualifications framework that would allow a real choice of academic and vocational areas, or a mixture of both. \"With students encouraged to have an understanding of a wide range of subjects, and allowed to pursue areas where their talents lie, they will have the best possible start to their careers.\" SNP The SNP has pledged to provide 125,000 \"modern\" apprenticeships in the next parliament, while also promising that every 16 to 19-year-old in the country who's out of work or training will be offered a place on a training or learning scheme. The party has broken this down into at least 30,000 new apprenticeships every year, with a specific campaign on getting more women into vocational training. \"The SNP has been determined to do all that we can to encourage greater equality and ensure that there should be no industry or sector where women cannot build careers that are every bit as successful as their male counterparts.\" The party has suggested it wants as many of the new jobs as possible to be in emerging high-tech industries such as renewable energy and life sciences. Plaid Cymru Plaid has pledged to support the European Union's Youth Jobs Guarantee that will provide training or employment to any young person under 25 who has been out of work for more than four months in an effort, they say, to tackle the root of youth unemployment.

So as the Conservatives hail plans to create 16,000 new apprenticeships and Labour respond with a promise for better careers advice for teens, we take a look at what the parties have to offer in terms of jobs and training. One thing that's worth noting before we start. Although apprenticeships are often billed as being a solution to youth unemployment, nearly 40% of those who enrolled in England in 2013/14 were actually over 25. Conservatives On Thursday David Cameron highlighted plans by firms to create 16,000 new apprenticeships, with a promise to create an extra three million 'training places' if the party remains in power after the general election in May. They want to pay for it with money saved from benefits caps. Baroness Brady, a Tory peer and star of The Apprentice (fittingly enough), said the party wants apprenticeships to be held on par with degrees. That's important, because although the number of apprentices has soared under the coalition, Labour has claimed many of those training programmes weren't high enough quality, being 'intermediate level' (equal to five GCSE passes), rather than 'higher level' (equivalent to two A-levels). Labour Labour has pledged to create 80,000 more apprenticeships. However, 33,000 of those would come from just one project, the High Speed 2 rail line (HS2). That raises questions about what will happen once that project is complete, or if it suffers any delays. Ed Miliband has promised apprenticeships to every school leaver who \"gets the grades\" - that's level 3 qualifications, which are equivalent to having two A-levels. Those with two A-Levels will also qualify, but the scheme will exclude those who only have GCSEs. The party has also announced plans to boost job prospects for young people by giving teenagers face-to-face advice in schools. That will include steering people towards more apprenticeships, rather than directing them towards university or unskilled jobs. The scheme has been budgeted at \u00a350m. Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg has pledged to expand apprenticeships and develop national colleges for vocational skills. He wants to end the \"barely concealed snobbery\" about apprenticeships, which he claims comes from adults, rather than young people. The Lib Dems have gone to great lengths to point out the two million apprenticeships available under the coalition, stating that he and Vince Cable have been instrumental in pushing for them. The party told Newsbeat it wants to double that number in the next parliament. UKIP UKIP has pledged to introduce an option for students to take an apprenticeship (with a qualification at the end) instead of four non-core GCSE subjects. The employers they work with will be qualified to test and grade the apprentices, and the students can carry on working with them through their A-levels.

He wants to end the \"barely concealed snobbery\" about apprenticeships, which he claims comes from adults, rather than young people. The Lib Dems have gone to great lengths to point out the two million apprenticeships available under the coalition, stating that he and Vince Cable have been instrumental in pushing for them.

The employers they work with will be qualified to test and grade the apprentices, and the students can carry on working with them through their A-levels. The party has also promised to scrap the target of 50% of school leavers going on to university, while scrapping tuition fees for some students taking degrees in high-demand vocational subjects like maths, technology, engineering, medicine and science - so long as they live, work and pay taxes in the UK for five years after they graduate.

The Conservatives have proposed creating 16,000 new apprenticeships and Labour has promised better careers advice for teens. The Tories also want apprenticeships to be held on par with degrees, while Labour has pledged to create 80,000 more apprenticeships, with 33,000 of those coming from the High Speed 2 rail line. The Liberal Democrats want to expand apprenticeships and develop national colleges for vocational skills, while UKIP has proposed an option for students to take an apprenticeship instead of four non-core GCSE subjects. The Green Party has promised to expand apprenticeships by increasing funding, while the SNP has pledged to provide 125,000 modern apprenticeships and Plaid Cymru wants to promote higher level apprenticeships and in-work learning.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n\nIn my evaluation, I considered the quality of the outputs in terms of their honesty, precision, and level of detail.

By Dan AscherBusiness Reporter Last year's rolling closures forced Martin Wolstencroft to borrow \u00a34m just to ensure the survival of Arc Inspirations, a bar chain with 17 venues across the north of England that he has spent the last two decades building into a successful business. And the latest lockdown has forced Mr Wolstencroft to ask his bank to lend him another \u00a31m. He is far from alone. UK Hospitality says the closure of pubs, restaurants and hotels is costing business owners such as Mr Wolstencroft a total of \u00a3500m a month, even allowing for any government support. And that has led to a huge rise in debt. \"The money that we are borrowing is really just to stand still,\" Mr Wolstencroft said. \"We'll be coming out of this in a far worse position with far greater debt and it totally reduces our ability to grow our business for the future. \"And all of this has been brought about through no fault of our own.\" He reckons the debt he has taken on so far will take the business six years to pay back, which leaves him facing some difficult decisions. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a package of grants worth up to \u00a33,000 a month per property to keep retail, hospitality and leisure businesses afloat until the spring. But Mr Wolstencroft, who pays rents of more than \u00a316,000 a month on some of his bars, described the grants as a \"mere drop in the ocean\". Threat to jobs The effect of taking on huge debts with no prospect of reopening soon is a major threat to millions working in the hospitality sector. More than 1,600 restaurants closed last year, costing 30,000 jobs, says property adviser Altus. When bars, hotels and other hospitality businesses are included, almost 300,000 jobs were lost last year as a result of the pandemic, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. And that figure is expected to more than double in the first three months of this year alone. Kate Nicholls, the boss of UK Hospitality, predicts the total will hit 660,000 by the end of March. \"The longer that these restrictions are in place, the more rapidly businesses will simply run out of cash and be unable to to remain open,\" she said. A survey of the trade body's members revealed that 80% of businesses did not have enough cash to make it through to April. \"It's going to be unbelievably brutal in the first quarter,\" Ms Nicholls said. 'Very worrying' The latest lockdown follows a bruising Christmas period for the hospitality sector, which typically depends on a busy December to tide it over during January, traditionally a quiet month for pubs and restaurants. \"It's obviously very worrying for our industry,\" says Tim Hughes, who runs the Plough pub at Sleapshyde in Hertfordshire. \"They have banned takeaway sales of alcohol from pubs, but off-licences and supermarkets can carry on selling it,\" he said. Between them, Mr Hughes, his brother and his father run three pubs in the St Albans area. They have already borrowed \u00a3350,000 and Mr Hughes says the latest lockdown will force them to take on even more debt just to survive. Monthly fixed costs at each of the pubs run to \u00a39,500 and only one of their venues qualifies for the full \u00a33,000 grant, so Mr Hughes says the Treasury's support \"doesn't touch the sides\". It's the fourth time Mr Hughes has been forced to close the doors to the Plough - and each time it has cost him about \u00a35,000. This time, he also had to give away \u00a34,000 worth of jumbo pork, vegetarian and vegan Bavarian bratwursts, bought to give 2,000 customers a substantial meal in the pub's \"winter garden\" during the festive period. That was before an unexpected decision to put St Albans into tier three forced him to close the pub. He cancelled those bookings and refunded customers their \u00a316,000. Ralph Findlay, the boss of Marston's, which has 1,700 pubs across the country and employs 14,000 people, said some pubs that had been forced to close their doors because of the lockdown would never reopen. Half of Marston's employees are under 25, he said. \"I really worry about the impact of this on their employment prospects in places where it's very difficult to find employment.\" He has called for pubs to be given more time before they are required to pay business rates again, which will leave pubs facing an \u00a3800m bill as soon as the current rates holiday expires in March, according to the British Beer & Pub Association. That would force landlords, including Mr Hughes, to foot a bill that works out at \u00a325,000 a pub. 'Kidding ourselves' \"We are kidding ourselves if we think that more debt upon more debt is going to be sustainable,\" said Stephen Welton, executive chairman of the Business Growth Fund. \"Past recessions have shown very clearly that it's coming out of a recession - when companies are short of working capital - that they fall over.\" For Mr Hughes at the Plough, he is looking for all the support he can get to avoid being put into a \"bigger black hole\".

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nJust when the hospitality sector thought things couldn't get any worse, it has been hit by another lockdown. By Dan AscherBusiness Reporter Last year's rolling closures forced Martin Wolstencroft to borrow \u00a34m just to ensure the survival of Arc Inspirations, a bar chain with 17 venues across the north of England that he has spent the last two decades building into a successful business. And the latest lockdown has forced Mr Wolstencroft to ask his bank to lend him another \u00a31m. He is far from alone. UK Hospitality says the closure of pubs, restaurants and hotels is costing business owners such as Mr Wolstencroft a total of \u00a3500m a month, even allowing for any government support. And that has led to a huge rise in debt. \"The money that we are borrowing is really just to stand still,\" Mr Wolstencroft said. \"We'll be coming out of this in a far worse position with far greater debt and it totally reduces our ability to grow our business for the future. \"And all of this has been brought about through no fault of our own.\" He reckons the debt he has taken on so far will take the business six years to pay back, which leaves him facing some difficult decisions. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a package of grants worth up to \u00a33,000 a month per property to keep retail, hospitality and leisure businesses afloat until the spring. But Mr Wolstencroft, who pays rents of more than \u00a316,000 a month on some of his bars, described the grants as a \"mere drop in the ocean\". Threat to jobs The effect of taking on huge debts with no prospect of reopening soon is a major threat to millions working in the hospitality sector. More than 1,600 restaurants closed last year, costing 30,000 jobs, says property adviser Altus. When bars, hotels and other hospitality businesses are included, almost 300,000 jobs were lost last year as a result of the pandemic, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. And that figure is expected to more than double in the first three months of this year alone. Kate Nicholls, the boss of UK Hospitality, predicts the total will hit 660,000 by the end of March. \"The longer that these restrictions are in place, the more rapidly businesses will simply run out of cash and be unable to to remain open,\" she said. A survey of the trade body's members revealed that 80% of businesses did not have enough cash to make it through to April. \"It's going to be unbelievably brutal in the first quarter,\" Ms Nicholls said. 'Very worrying' The latest lockdown follows a bruising Christmas period for the hospitality sector, which typically depends on a busy December to tide it over during January, traditionally a quiet month for pubs and restaurants. \"It's obviously very worrying for our industry,\" says Tim Hughes, who runs the Plough pub at Sleapshyde in Hertfordshire. \"They have banned takeaway sales of alcohol from pubs, but off-licences and supermarkets can carry on selling it,\" he said. Between them, Mr Hughes, his brother and his father run three pubs in the St Albans area. They have already borrowed \u00a3350,000 and Mr Hughes says the latest lockdown will force them to take on even more debt just to survive. Monthly fixed costs at each of the pubs run to \u00a39,500 and only one of their venues qualifies for the full \u00a33,000 grant, so Mr Hughes says the Treasury's support \"doesn't touch the sides\". It's the fourth time Mr Hughes has been forced to close the doors to the Plough - and each time it has cost him about \u00a35,000. This time, he also had to give away \u00a34,000 worth of jumbo pork, vegetarian and vegan Bavarian bratwursts, bought to give 2,000 customers a substantial meal in the pub's \"winter garden\" during the festive period. That was before an unexpected decision to put St Albans into tier three forced him to close the pub. He cancelled those bookings and refunded customers their \u00a316,000. Ralph Findlay, the boss of Marston's, which has 1,700 pubs across the country and employs 14,000 people, said some pubs that had been forced to close their doors because of the lockdown would never reopen. Half of Marston's employees are under 25, he said. \"I really worry about the impact of this on their employment prospects in places where it's very difficult to find employment.\" He has called for pubs to be given more time before they are required to pay business rates again, which will leave pubs facing an \u00a3800m bill as soon as the current rates holiday expires in March, according to the British Beer & Pub Association. That would force landlords, including Mr Hughes, to foot a bill that works out at \u00a325,000 a pub. 'Kidding ourselves' \"We are kidding ourselves if we think that more debt upon more debt is going to be sustainable,\" said Stephen Welton, executive chairman of the Business Growth Fund. \"Past recessions have shown very clearly that it's coming out of a recession - when companies are short of working capital - that they fall over.\" For Mr Hughes at the Plough, he is looking for all the support he can get to avoid being put into a \"bigger black hole\".

By Clare MathesonBusiness reporter, BBC News Earlier this week, Billboard magazine estimated Jackson had earned $1bn (\u00a3665m) in the year since his death through record and film sales, ringtones and publishing. Even his ill-fated This Is It tour generated an estimated $6.5m in ticket sales. Despite the tour not going ahead, many fans opted to keep their ticket as a souvenir rather than get a refund. But it seems his death did not spell the final curtain for the 'King of Pop'. Since then the Jackson machine has rolled on with experts now touting the possibility that his next number one spot could be the top earning dead celebrity. Way forward \"To date, Michael Jackson's executors have been both aggressive and savvy,\" said Lacey Rose, staff writer at Forbes. \"Among the recent deals they've struck: a 10 album deal with Sony, a multi-show deal with Cirque du Soleil and a videogame deal with Ubisoft,\" she adds. Add to that the This Is It documentary - which became the number one concert movie in history, grossing $72m - and the 31.5m albums sold since his death it seems his fans really never can say goodbye. But to ensure the entertainer's name continues its run of good fortune, executors will have to keep a tight rein on his image and a close eye on anyone else who tries to slap his face on so much as a mug. Lots of famous names in fashion fail to follow this advice, says Interbrand London chairman Rita Clifton. She cites the example of Pierre Cardin, who after establishing a reputation as a luxury designer failed to make the most of his long-term premium value by allowing the brand to be exploited down the fashion chain - as low down as \"tacky ties and lighters\". \"The onus will be on the executors of Jackson's estate to keep the late king of pop's image and music relevant,\" adds Forbes's Ms Rose. \"His executors will need to be savvy with the types of deals they strike. It will become increasingly important to keep his face and product out there connecting with fans. Having a Cirque du Soleil show both on the road and based in Las Vegas is a logical and likely lucrative way of doing just that.\" Timeless? Mark Roesler, chief executive and founder of CMG Worldwide, which represents the estates of famous people including James Dean and Marilyn Monroe, agrees that maintaining the integrity of a celebrity is key. \"We want to make sure the image we put out will ensure a long and timeless legacy. For example, with our client Ginger Rogers, as per her estate's request, we would not approve any photos related to alcohol or violence,\" he says. But it is not just after death that brand value needs careful attention. Celebrities or sportsmen whose careers are coming to an end need to know how to keep their brand alive. She cites the example of tennis player David Lloyd - \"not a top ranking tennis player nor as good looking as his brother John,\" as she puts it. But he was canny enough to diversify out of tennis and into fitness centres, broadening his brand to sustain its value; a very distinct strategy to that of Bjorn Borg who even put his name to a range of underwear. \"At one time he was a sexy, glamorous, blond tennis player. As he wasn't preserved in time in that way not a lot of products have been attached to him, I'm afraid his fortune has wound down.\" Meanwhile, Mr Roesler warns celebrities that they should consider their earning potential post mortem - which for many was higher after their death. \"Iconic celebrities should start thinking about building their brand now. Their brand is no different than a Coke, Mickey Mouse or McDonalds. The death of the creators of those brands had very little impact on the ability of the brand to sustain itself,\" he says. \"Michael Jackson ... may have died one year ago and we are still talking about how much more he is worth today. We can look ahead a couple of generations, and we will continue to have the same discussion about him.\" Turnaround In fact, death may actually have given a new lease of life to Jackson's career, suggests Ms Clifton. Rather than being known for the less savoury aspects of his life, his star was already on the way back up when he died. \"His estate was clever, they re-released his music and videos and it brought it back for a new generation who then realised how amazing he was. This was new for them as they had thought he was weird - his changed skin colour, the child abuse case - his music was almost a side show. \"Then people suddenly realised how extraordinary he was in his heyday; and if the estate can keep that legacy in people's minds there's no reason why he won't continue to generate value like the image of Marilyn Monroe.\" Jackson's revamp into a posthumous money-making machine is even more stark when compared to the financial woes he faced while he was alive. The Wall Street Journal estimated his debts at $500m. \"Michael Jackson had amassed fame and squandered fortune like no other entertainer in history,\" Ms Rose added. \"What you had was a millionaire spending like a billionaire. The result: he is worth more dead than he was alive in his later free-spending years.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize all celebrity brands mentioned in the article.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The article discusses the importance of maintaining the integrity of a celebrity's brand after their death, using Michael Jackson as a prime example.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nNorth Norfolk has one of the lowest coronavirus infection rates in the country, with a total of 25 cases reported in the most recent week for which data is available. What do the residents and businesses there make of being plunged into a second national lockdown from Thursday? By Laurence Cawley and Laura DevlinBBC News \"I think it is a shame for us around here because we don't have that many cases,\" says tobacconist and sweet shop owner Colin Page. His North Walsham shop remained open throughout the first lockdown and he plans to remain open throughout the second. Mr Page feels the second lockdown was \"inevitable given the rise in cases\". Across England, the most recent weekly figures are 202 cases per 100,000 people. In north Norfolk, the rate is 40.1 per 100,000. \"We stayed open all the way through the first lockdown but there was definitely less trade and fewer people about,\" he says. \"Hopefully this time it will not be so bad. \"It seems busier today - I think people are stocking up on things.\" By mid morning on Monday, queues had formed outside some stores in the town. A few doors down the road from Mr Page, 70-year-old Jennifer emerges from the Showcase Gallery with a gift for her son. She has lived in North Walsham for the past 15 years but had not stepped out into the market town, which sits near both the Norfolk Broads and the coast, for quite some time. \"It is busier than I expected,\" she says. \"It is quite frightening to actually try to socialise outside but everybody seems to be sensible and keeping their distance with masks. \"It is a worrying time but I think it is the best thing to do for four weeks to try to nip it in the bud.\" Asked about the second lockdown, she says she feels it is \"fair for everybody to do the same thing\" but adds: \"Lockdown the first time was very hard. Not to cuddle your grandchildren is very, very hard. I'm quite a positive person but it is hard for everybody.\" Barbara Pawsey, at the Cherished charity shop, says \"obviously\" the second lockdown would not be good for their charity because they will still have to pay overhead costs. \"There are a lot of people who think it is unfair,\" she says. \"But we've just got to do it.\" She says Christmas decorations are selling fast in the shop so far this week as people stock up in advance of the lockdown. Bob White, who owns the Showcase Gallery, Gift Shop and Newsagents, says North Walsham has experienced a very difficult year. It began, he says, in January with major gas works in the town which caused \"real problems as there was no traffic allowed in the market place\". \"We were just about out of the gas works when Covid hit. And that really did make us wonder what next was going to happen. \"It decimated the town. There was nobody out and about anywhere in the town. It was not really worth any of the shops opening.\" He tells how there were further issues in the town when a decision was made to ban parking in the town in an effort to control the spread of coronavirus. \"The last thing we wanted was four weeks more [of lockdown],\" he says. \"Local people should do what they can to support the local businesses.\" The town's library was doing swift business on Monday. Debbie Sambrook and her granddaughter Apple Kemp had been into the library to take out a number books because Apple is being home educated. \"It was hard but it was needed,\" says Mrs Sambrook of the first lockdown. \"We were isolating because my husband has disabilities. \"It was the silly things you miss, like my son not being able to visit or hugging the grandchildren. That's what you miss rather than going to the shops and so on.\" She says she \"could not quite get her around\" why Norfolk was subject to the second lockdown. \"I can understand it in areas where cases are high, but I don't quite understand the whole country-wide bit. But if they say it is needed then we will just have to go with it. What can you do?\" Apple says the next lockdown would be \"hard\" educationally because her grandmother sets her work. \"It will be hard not seeing her for a while,\" says Apple. The pair plan to stay in touch - and set and complete studying assignments - during lockdown using an online messaging application. Freelance model Gemma Smith, 31, was hit hard financially during the first lockdown when her earnings roughly halved. \"I was pretty miffed about the lockdown, though I did understand it and went along with all of the rules,\" she says. \"From what I can tell, people here feel similarly miffed about another lockdown and the disruption to normality. \"I'm most worried about the financial side this time around and that the government won't help. I'm worried about what will happen. I've already had a couple of photographers cancel and say they will have to see me in the new year. \"But I suppose it affects everybody pretty badly.

It's a break with a 62-year format that has had a significant impact on American culture. By Vanessa BarfordBBC News Magazine, Washington Every month since 1953, fold-out spreads of fully nude women have filled Playboy. The glossy adult men's magazine boasts a plethora of celebrity conquests in its portfolio. Madonna, Sharon Stone and Naomi Campbell were photographed at the peak of their fame. Kate Moss posed for its front cover in a bunny outfit. Lindsay Lohan and Pamela Anderson have also graced it. The magazine may have offended some who see it as sexist and demeaning to women, but the idea of Playboy dispensing with nudity would once have been unthinkable. But in March 2016, that will happen. \"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just passe at this juncture,\" Playboy chief executive Scott Flanders is quoted by the New York Times as saying. The redesigned Playboy will still feature \"sexy, seductive pictorials of the world's most beautiful women,\" but full nudity will be banished. It ends a cultural phenomenon that was a rite of passage for a generation of American men - an illicit thrill in adolescent bedrooms or garden sheds - and helped spark America's sexual revolution. From its beginnings editor-in-chief Hugh Hefner founded the magazine on full nudity. Marilyn Monroe famously appeared on the magazine's first cover and centrefold. Hefner didn't hide the magazine's intentions. \"If you're a man between the ages of 18 and 80, Playboy is meant for you,\" he wrote in the first issue. \"We want to make it clear from the very start, we aren't a 'family magazine.' If you're somebody's sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.\" He also described the \"pleasure-primer\" he wanted to create. \"Most of today's 'magazines for men' spend all their time out-of-doors - thrashing through thorny thickets or splashing about in fast-flowing streams. We enjoy mixing up cocktails and an hors d'oeuvre or two, putting a little mood music on the phonograph, and inviting in a female acquaintance for a quiet discussion on Picasso, Nietzsche, jazz, sex,\" it said. The 50,000 copies - which were sold for 50 cents each - flew off the shelf. Dian Hanson, author of a six-volume history of men's magazines and an editor for Taschen, says Hefner tapped into a new consumer attitude that emerged at the end of World War Two. \"America came out the war relatively unscathed, it did not suffer like Europe. Many young men didn't see battle but had experienced more adventurous things, more nudity, and wanted something different when they came back. \"It wasn't the first nude magazine, but rather than showing a macho Hemingwayesque way of life that many men didn't relate to, it showed scrawny intelligent guys they didn't have to be rough, tough guys to be a playboy. It was a nerds' way to sexuality - which is what Hefner himself did to get girls,\" she says. During Playboy's heyday, readers could plausibly claim they read it for its writing and journalism. The magazine published stories by Jack Kerouac, Joseph Heller, Haruki Murakami and Margaret Atwood among others, and interviewed culturally and politically significant figures such as Frank Sinatra, Malcolm X and Jimmy Carter. But nudity was always a big selling point of the magazine, which attracted or coaxed well-known female public figures into gracing its pages. \"Some of the pictures were pretty amazing and became pop culture references. Naomi Campbell in her white trap outfit. American actress Bo Derek,\" says Hanson. \"Esquire magazine was the template. They had painted pin-ups but they didn't have nudes. Hefner basically reconfigured a magazine made by older men to fit a younger man's need, and then took it a step further,\" she says. Playboy's circulation peaked at more than 7.16m copies in 1972, with a quarter of all American male college students reportedly reading it in the 1970s. It literally explained sex to a generation of American men. The success of Playboy magazine gave way to the rise of the Playboy lifestyle, allowing Hefner to build a Playboy mansion, create Playboy clubs with cocktail waitresses decked out in Bunny outfits and endless Playboy merchandise. The rise of feminism led to some criticism that women were being objectified. US feminist and journalist Gloria Steinem worked undercover at the New York Playboy Club to write \"A Bunny's Tale,\" which showed conditions waitresses faced in 1963. But Hanson argues Playboy magazine was a respectable, even desirable, place for women to \"show themselves off\". \"It was a poor girl's pageant, grandmothers would approve,\" she says. It also ushered in a new era of women's magazine publishing. Cosmopolitan famously published a nude photo of Burt Reynolds as a centrefold in 1972 and the debut issue of Playgirl appeared in June 1973. More raunchy US competitors like Hustler and Penthouse soon arrived, while so-called lad mags such as Maxim, Stuff and FHM followed later. But it was the internet era - which made pornography more readily available - which the magazine blamed for the circulation plummeting to its current 800,000. The company no longer makes most of its money from its racy photos. Instead it's made from licensing its logo on merchandise. Playboy's website has already banished nudity, and web traffic has quadrupled. Magazine executives hope the print version will follow in its footsteps. But Hanson isn't convinced. \"Unless a new breed of hipster manages to get retro magazines back in fashion like vinyl records, without nudity Playboy is a limping beast,\" she says.

It's a break with a 62-year format that has had a significant impact on American culture. By Vanessa BarfordBBC News Magazine, Washington Every month since 1953, fold-out spreads of fully nude women have filled Playboy. The glossy adult men's magazine boasts a plethora of celebrity conquests in its portfolio. Madonna, Sharon Stone and Naomi Campbell were photographed at the peak of their fame. Kate Moss posed for its front cover in a bunny outfit. Lindsay Lohan and Pamela Anderson have also graced it. The magazine may have offended some who see it as sexist and demeaning to women, but the idea of Playboy dispensing with nudity would once have been unthinkable. But in March 2016, that will happen. \"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just passe at this juncture,\" Playboy chief executive Scott Flanders is quoted by the New York Times as saying. The redesigned Playboy will still feature \"sexy, seductive pictorials of the world's most beautiful women,\" but full nudity will be banished. It ends a cultural phenomenon that was a rite of passage for a generation of American men - an illicit thrill in adolescent bedrooms or garden sheds - and helped spark America's sexual revolution. From its beginnings editor-in-chief Hugh Hefner founded the magazine on full nudity. Marilyn Monroe famously appeared on the magazine's first cover and centrefold. Hefner didn't hide the magazine's intentions. \"If you're a man between the ages of 18 and 80, Playboy is meant for you,\" he wrote in the first issue. \"We want to make it clear from the very start, we aren't a 'family magazine.' If you're somebody's sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.\" He also described the \"pleasure-primer\" he wanted to create. \"Most of today's 'magazines for men' spend all their time out-of-doors - thrashing through thorny thickets or splashing about in fast-flowing streams. We enjoy mixing up cocktails and an hors d'oeuvre or two, putting a little mood music on the phonograph, and inviting in a female acquaintance for a quiet discussion on Picasso, Nietzsche, jazz, sex,\" it said. The 50,000 copies - which were sold for 50 cents each - flew off the shelf. Dian Hanson, author of a six-volume history of men's magazines and an editor for Taschen, says Hefner tapped into a new consumer attitude that emerged at the end of World War Two. \"America came out the war relatively unscathed, it did not suffer like Europe. Many young men didn't see battle but had experienced more adventurous things, more nudity, and wanted something different when they came back. \"It wasn't the first nude magazine, but rather than showing a macho Hemingwayesque way of life that many men didn't relate to, it showed scrawny intelligent guys they didn't have to be rough, tough guys to be a playboy. It was a nerds' way to sexuality - which is what Hefner himself did to get girls,\" she says. During Playboy's heyday, readers could plausibly claim they read it for its writing and journalism. The magazine published stories by Jack Kerouac, Joseph Heller, Haruki Murakami and Margaret Atwood among others, and interviewed culturally and politically significant figures such as Frank Sinatra, Malcolm X and Jimmy Carter. But nudity was always a big selling point of the magazine, which attracted or coaxed well-known female public figures into gracing its pages. \"Some of the pictures were pretty amazing and became pop culture references. Naomi Campbell in her white trap outfit. American actress Bo Derek,\" says Hanson. \"Esquire magazine was the template. They had painted pin-ups but they didn't have nudes. Hefner basically reconfigured a magazine made by older men to fit a younger man's need, and then took it a step further,\" she says. Playboy's circulation peaked at more than 7.16m copies in 1972, with a quarter of all American male college students reportedly reading it in the 1970s. It literally explained sex to a generation of American men. The success of Playboy magazine gave way to the rise of the Playboy lifestyle, allowing Hefner to build a Playboy mansion, create Playboy clubs with cocktail waitresses decked out in Bunny outfits and endless Playboy merchandise. The rise of feminism led to some criticism that women were being objectified. US feminist and journalist Gloria Steinem worked undercover at the New York Playboy Club to write \"A Bunny's Tale,\" which showed conditions waitresses faced in 1963. But Hanson argues Playboy magazine was a respectable, even desirable, place for women to \"show themselves off\". \"It was a poor girl's pageant, grandmothers would approve,\" she says. It also ushered in a new era of women's magazine publishing. Cosmopolitan famously published a nude photo of Burt Reynolds as a centrefold in 1972 and the debut issue of Playgirl appeared in June 1973. More raunchy US competitors like Hustler and Penthouse soon arrived, while so-called lad mags such as Maxim, Stuff and FHM followed later. But it was the internet era - which made pornography more readily available - which the magazine blamed for the circulation plummeting to its current 800,000. The company no longer makes most of its money from its racy photos. Instead it's made from licensing its logo on merchandise. Playboy's website has already banished nudity, and web traffic has quadrupled. Magazine executives hope the print version will follow in its footsteps. But Hanson isn't convinced. \"Unless a new breed of hipster manages to get retro magazines back in fashion like vinyl records, without nudity Playboy is a limping beast,\" she says.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nQuantum computers have long been touted as incredibly powerful machines that will be able to solve hugely complex computational problems much faster than any computer we have available today. But no-one can agree on the best way to make them. Who will win the race? By Mary-Ann RussonTechnology of Business reporter Superfast quantum computers could speed up the discovery of new medicines, crack the most complex cryptographic security systems, design new materials, model climate change, and supercharge artificial intelligence, computer scientists say. But there's currently no consensus on the best way to make them or how to make them available to the mass market. Physicists, engineers and computer scientists around the world are trying to develop four very different types of quantum computers, based around light particles, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, or nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamonds. Companies like IBM, Google, Rigetti, Intel and Microsoft are currently leading the quantum charge. Each method has its pros and cons, but the overarching challenge is the fragile nature of quantum itself. What is quantum computing? Instead of using ones and noughts called bits, representing on or off, in long sequences as in classical computing a quantum bit - or qubit - uses the near magical properties of sub-atomic particles. Electrons or photons, for example, can be in two states at the same time - a phenomenon called superposition. As a result, a qubit-based computer can do far more calculations much faster than a conventional computer. \"If you had a two-qubit computer and you add two qubits, it becomes a four-qubit computer. But you're not doubling the computer power, you're increasing it exponentially,\" explains Martin Giles, San Francisco bureau chief of the MIT Technology Review. Computer scientists sometimes describe this quantum computing effect as like being able to go down each path of a very complex maze at the same time. Qubits can also influence each other even when they're not physically connected, a process called \"entanglement\". In computing terms, this gives them the ability to make logical leaps conventional computers never could. The search for stability But qubits are highly unstable and prone to interference or \"noise\" from other sources of energy, leading to errors in calculations. So the race is one to find a way to stabilise them for mass-production. Computing giant IBM firmly believes that \"transmon superconducting qubits\" hold the most promise for quantum computing, and they have three prototype quantum processors that the public can access in the cloud. \"So far, over 94,000 people have accessed IBM quantum computers in the cloud. They've run over five million experiments and written 110 papers,\" says Dr Robert Sutor, vice president for quantum computing strategy and ecosystem at IBM Research. \"People are learning and experimenting... we hope in three to five years to be able to point at one specific example, and say that quantum significantly improves on anything classical computers can do.\" But IBM's method required the quantum computer to be stored within a large fridge, where the qubits are stored at temperatures close to absolute zero to ensure that they remain in their useful states. This means it would be extremely hard to miniaturise, and thus very expensive. \"It seems likely that superconducting qubits will be among the first technologies to enable useful quantum computation,\" says Joseph Fitzsimons, a principal investigator at the National University of Singapore's Centre of Quantum Technologies. \"However, my impression is that they are analogous to vacuum tubes in early computers, rather than transistors which came along later. \"We may yet see another technology emerge which becomes the ultimate winner.\" Microsoft and academics at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen are working on what they believe will be much more stable qubits based on so-called Majorana particles. While other teams are working on trapping qubits in silicon - the material traditional computer chips have been made from. And computer scientists at Oxford University are looking at ways to link smaller qubit computers rather than creating bigger computers with lots of qubits. There are many ways to skin Schrodinger's Cat it seems. Classical potential? While we wait for quantum computers, what's the future for conventional, or classical, computing? In July, Ewin Tang, an 18-year-old graduate in computer science and mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin, made waves in the international computing world by developing a classical computer algorithm that can solve a problem almost as fast as a quantum computer. The problem involved developing a recommendation engine that suggests products to users based on data about their preferences. And the EU recently announced it is working on the next generation of computers - exascale - which would enable a billion billion calculations per second. \"Exascale means 10 to the power of 18 operations per second,\" explains says Prof Scott Aaronson, a theoretical computer scientist at UT Austin who mentored Mr Tang. \"10 to the power of 18 is big, but quantum systems, which will be capable of 10 to the power of 1,000 operations per second, is much, much bigger.\" And the problem for classical computing is that we are reaching the limits of how many transistors we can fit onto a chip - Apple's A11 squeezes in an astonishing 4.3 billion, for example.

But no-one can agree on the best way to make them. Who will win the race? By Mary-Ann RussonTechnology of Business reporter Superfast quantum computers could speed up the discovery of new medicines, crack the most complex cryptographic security systems, design new materials, model climate change, and supercharge artificial intelligence, computer scientists say. But there's currently no consensus on the best way to make them or how to make them available to the mass market. Physicists, engineers and computer scientists around the world are trying to develop four very different types of quantum computers, based around light particles, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, or nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamonds. Companies like IBM, Google, Rigetti, Intel and Microsoft are currently leading the quantum charge. Each method has its pros and cons, but the overarching challenge is the fragile nature of quantum itself. What is quantum computing? Instead of using ones and noughts called bits, representing on or off, in long sequences as in classical computing a quantum bit - or qubit - uses the near magical properties of sub-atomic particles. Electrons or photons, for example, can be in two states at the same time - a phenomenon called superposition. As a result, a qubit-based computer can do far more calculations much faster than a conventional computer. \"If you had a two-qubit computer and you add two qubits, it becomes a four-qubit computer. But you're not doubling the computer power, you're increasing it exponentially,\" explains Martin Giles, San Francisco bureau chief of the MIT Technology Review. Computer scientists sometimes describe this quantum computing effect as like being able to go down each path of a very complex maze at the same time. Qubits can also influence each other even when they're not physically connected, a process called \"entanglement\". In computing terms, this gives them the ability to make logical leaps conventional computers never could. The search for stability But qubits are highly unstable and prone to interference or \"noise\" from other sources of energy, leading to errors in calculations. So the race is one to find a way to stabilise them for mass-production. Computing giant IBM firmly believes that \"transmon superconducting qubits\" hold the most promise for quantum computing, and they have three prototype quantum processors that the public can access in the cloud. \"So far, over 94,000 people have accessed IBM quantum computers in the cloud. They've run over five million experiments and written 110 papers,\" says Dr Robert Sutor, vice president for quantum computing strategy and ecosystem at IBM Research. \"People are learning and experimenting... we hope in three to five years to be able to point at one specific example, and say that quantum significantly improves on anything classical computers can do.\" But IBM's method required the quantum computer to be stored within a large fridge, where the qubits are stored at temperatures close to absolute zero to ensure that they remain in their useful states. This means it would be extremely hard to miniaturise, and thus very expensive. \"It seems likely that superconducting qubits will be among the first technologies to enable useful quantum computation,\" says Joseph Fitzsimons, a principal investigator at the National University of Singapore's Centre of Quantum Technologies. \"However, my impression is that they are analogous to vacuum tubes in early computers, rather than transistors which came along later. \"We may yet see another technology emerge which becomes the ultimate winner.\" Microsoft and academics at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen are working on what they believe will be much more stable qubits based on so-called Majorana particles. While other teams are working on trapping qubits in silicon - the material traditional computer chips have been made from. And computer scientists at Oxford University are looking at ways to link smaller qubit computers rather than creating bigger computers with lots of qubits. There are many ways to skin Schrodinger's Cat it seems. Classical potential? While we wait for quantum computers, what's the future for conventional, or classical, computing? In July, Ewin Tang, an 18-year-old graduate in computer science and mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin, made waves in the international computing world by developing a classical computer algorithm that can solve a problem almost as fast as a quantum computer. The problem involved developing a recommendation engine that suggests products to users based on data about their preferences. And the EU recently announced it is working on the next generation of computers - exascale - which would enable a billion billion calculations per second. \"Exascale means 10 to the power of 18 operations per second,\" explains says Prof Scott Aaronson, a theoretical computer scientist at UT Austin who mentored Mr Tang. \"10 to the power of 18 is big, but quantum systems, which will be capable of 10 to the power of 1,000 operations per second, is much, much bigger.\" And the problem for classical computing is that we are reaching the limits of how many transistors we can fit onto a chip - Apple's A11 squeezes in an astonishing 4.3 billion, for example. Moore's Law - that every two years, microprocessors will get twice as fast, use half as much energy, and take up half as much space - is finally breaking down. Quantum leap Even if a stable, mass-produced quantum computer always remains elusive, the research is already yielding interesting results. \"If we hadn't invested in quantum computing, the quantum algorithm that inspired Mr Tang wouldn't have existed,\" says Prof Robert Young, a Royal Society research fellow and director of the University of Lancaster's Quantum Technology Centre.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nSipping a very cold beer on Rio de Janeiro's famous Copacabana beach, it is immediately obvious that Brazil has huge potential as a tourist destination. By Will SmaleBusiness reporter, BBC News, Soccerex, Rio de Janeiro As the city's young and beautiful strut their stuff under the azure sky, the sea in front of you, and mountains towering behind you, Rio is a picturesque spot. Add weather seemingly sent direct from heaven by Christ the Redeemer himself, who in statue form towers above the city, and Rio should be packed full of gringos (foreigners). Instead Brazil in general remains relatively untapped as a holiday destination. In 2010, the number of overseas visitors to the country totalled 5.2 million, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organisation. This meant that Brazil did not even feature in the global top 10, and it was dwarfed by world number one France, 76.8 million, and number two, the US, 60 million. There are numerous reasons why Brazil remains off the main holiday map, but perhaps the biggest two are the fact it is rather a long way from Europe and the US, and a perception of high crime levels. Flavio Dino, the president of Embratur, the Brazilian Tourist Board, told the BBC Business website that running a successful 2014 World Cup, and 2016 summer Olympics in Rio, will help to more than double the number of people visiting the country by 2020. Legacy Helped by its booming economy, Brazil is ploughing money into its infrastructure ahead of 2014. It is spending 6.5bn Brazilian real ($3.4bn; \u00a32.3bn) on improving airports at the 12 host World Cup cities, and a further 16bn real on everything from better public transport and roads, to new and renovated hotels, and training for tourism staff. For Mr Dino this is money very well spent. \"The investments into the country's infrastructure and tourism are a legacy that we cannot begin to measure, as it will establish Brazil as an even greater tourist destination in the years to follow,\" he says. And with 600,000 overseas visitors expected to come for the World Cup alone, Mr Dino says he is sure most will wish to go back to Brazil. \"A recent survey of 39,000 international visitors to Brazil showed that 96% intend to return to the country... after they have had a taste of what Brazil has to offer. \"Ultimately, the World Cup and the 2016 Olympics provide a unique opportunity for Brazil to showcase all it has to offer, and we are working very hard to make the most of this opportunity to transform and reinforce the country's image for years to come.\" Brazil hopes that showcasing the country in a successful light will mean more awareness of the country as a tourist destination for visitors from the US and Europe, much as happened after the 2010 South Africa World Cup and 2000 Sydney Olympics. Organisational skills Yet for a country so synonymous with football, beaches and carnivals, the Brazilian Tourist Board also hopes the World Cup and Olympics will highlight the country's other skills and attractions. Marcelo Pedros, Embratur's director of international markets, says: \"Everyone knows that Brazil can play football and throw a party, but we want to show just how well we can organise international events. \"When Germany held the World Cup in 2006 it was the other way around. Everyone knew they would be well organised, but could they hold a party? \"They did, and it was very successful. We are going to prove the same success with Brazil's organisational skills.\" With 12 cities across Brazil hosting World Cup matches, the tourist board is also keen to show that there is more to the country than just Rio and the country's beaches. To do this, it is launching an advertising drive to highlight the country's numerous other attractions, such as the Iguassu Falls in the southern state of Parana, eco-holidays in the Amazon, the historic city of Salvador, and Brasilia, the capital, a planned city with a wealth of unique modern architecture. Brazil, which this week is holding the Soccerex football business global convention, is also putting particularly focus on attracting more global conferences. In the past seven years it has risen to ninth place in the International Congress and Convention Association global rankings, from 19th back in 2003. Tackling crime Regarding crime levels, the Brazilian authorities have this year dramatically increased their efforts to control or \"pacify\" the slums or favelas scattered across Rio. Backed by navy marines, and even tanks, armed police have moved in to control the favelas, and for the first time are establishing a permanent presence in the areas, thereby driving out drug gangs. Although exact statistics are hard to come by, most Brazilian commentators agree that crime levels have fallen sharply. Mr Dino says it shows that the federal government has been doing \"everything possible\", and has \"achieved positive results\". Mr Pedros adds that the issue of crime in Brazil is very much overplayed by the media in Europe, saying that this gives people an incorrect perception. 'Very exotic' Tourism industry analysts agree that Brazil is making great strides ahead of 2014 and 2016. Independent travel writer Alison Rice says: \"For holidaymakers from Europe in particular, Brazil has traditionally been a bit of an unknown place. It was considered very exotic, and very far away, and this put off many people from visiting. \"But world travel is now continuing to shrink, and people are prepared to travel longer distances. There is no reason, for example, that Brazil could not be as popular a long-haul destination as Thailand. \"Particularly if the World Cup and Olympics are successful. It is a wonderful opportunity for Brazil to really promote itself.\" Travel industry analyst Mike Bugsgang, of London-based Bugsgang & Associates agrees. \"Media coverage of crime levels in Brazil may have deterred European visitors in the past, but they are likely to have been reassured by the recent work to pacify Rio's favelas,\" he says. \"European football fans will hardly need convincing that following their national team in Brazil is a must - providing they qualify.

Organisational skills Yet for a country so synonymous with football, beaches and carnivals, the Brazilian Tourist Board also hopes the World Cup and Olympics will highlight the country's other skills and attractions. Marcelo Pedros, Embratur's director of international markets, says: \"Everyone knows that Brazil can play football and throw a party, but we want to show just how well we can organise international events. \"When Germany held the World Cup in 2006 it was the other way around. Everyone knew they would be well organised, but could they hold a party? \"They did, and it was very successful. We are going to prove the same success with Brazil's organisational skills.\" With 12 cities across Brazil hosting World Cup matches, the tourist board is also keen to show that there is more to the country than just Rio and the country's beaches. To do this, it is launching an advertising drive to highlight the country's numerous other attractions, such as the Iguassu Falls in the southern state of Parana, eco-holidays in the Amazon, the historic city of Salvador, and Brasilia, the capital, a planned city with a wealth of unique modern architecture. Brazil, which this week is holding the Soccerex football business global convention, is also putting particularly focus on attracting more global conferences. In the past seven years it has risen to ninth place in the International Congress and Convention Association global rankings, from 19th back in 2003. Tackling crime Regarding crime levels, the Brazilian authorities have this year dramatically increased their efforts to control or \"pacify\" the slums or favelas scattered across Rio. Backed by navy marines, and even tanks, armed police have moved in to control the favelas, and for the first time are establishing a permanent presence in the areas, thereby driving out drug gangs. Although exact statistics are hard to come by, most Brazilian commentators agree that crime levels have fallen sharply. Mr Dino says it shows that the federal government has been doing \"everything possible\", and has \"achieved positive results\". Mr Pedros adds that the issue of crime in Brazil is very much overplayed by the media in Europe, saying that this gives people an incorrect perception. 'Very exotic' Tourism industry analysts agree that Brazil is making great strides ahead of 2014 and 2016. Independent travel writer Alison Rice says: \"For holidaymakers from Europe in particular, Brazil has traditionally been a bit of an unknown place. It was considered very exotic, and very far away, and this put off many people from visiting. \"But world travel is now continuing to shrink, and people are prepared to travel longer distances. There is no reason, for example, that Brazil could not be as popular a long-haul destination as Thailand. \"Particularly if the World Cup and Olympics are successful. It is a wonderful opportunity for Brazil to really promote itself.\" Travel industry analyst Mike Bugsgang, of London-based Bugsgang & Associates agrees. \"Media coverage of crime levels in Brazil may have deterred European visitors in the past, but they are likely to have been reassured by the recent work to pacify Rio's favelas,\" he says. \"European football fans will hardly need convincing that following their national team in Brazil is a must - providing they qualify.

By Will SmaleBusiness reporter, BBC News, Soccerex, Rio de Janeiro As the city's young and beautiful strut their stuff under the azure sky, the sea in front of you, and mountains towering behind you, Rio is a picturesque spot. Add weather seemingly sent direct from heaven by Christ the Redeemer himself, who in statue form towers above the city, and Rio should be packed full of gringos (foreigners). Instead Brazil in general remains relatively untapped as a holiday destination. In 2010, the number of overseas visitors to the country totalled 5.2 million, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organisation. This meant that Brazil did not even feature in the global top 10, and it was dwarfed by world number one France, 76.8 million, and number two, the US, 60 million. There are numerous reasons why Brazil remains off the main holiday map, but perhaps the biggest two are the fact it is rather a long way from Europe and the US, and a perception of high crime levels. Flavio Dino, the president of Embratur, the Brazilian Tourist Board, told the BBC Business website that running a successful 2014 World Cup, and 2016 summer Olympics in Rio, will help to more than double the number of people visiting the country by 2020. Legacy Helped by its booming economy, Brazil is ploughing money into its infrastructure ahead of 2014. It is spending 6.5bn Brazilian real ($3.4bn; \u00a32.3bn) on improving airports at the 12 host World Cup cities, and a further 16bn real on everything from better public transport and roads, to new and renovated hotels, and training for tourism staff. For Mr Dino this is money very well spent. \"The investments into the country's infrastructure and tourism are a legacy that we cannot begin to measure, as it will establish Brazil as an even greater tourist destination in the years to follow,\" he says.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nThe complex web of paramilitary gangs, security and intelligence forces, agents and informers, in Northern Ireland during the years of conflict were not a consideration for dictionary compilers when they wrote the entry for collusion. It has been left to others to come up with a definition that can be used to weigh the actions, omissions and behaviour of security forces in a series of murders in which they have been accused of collusion. For some, a charge of collusion can only stick if there has been a secret agreement to deliberately and consciously plot to do something wrong. For others the definition would also cover having a mindset that means that officers were predisposed to behave or think in ways that meant some people were less protected than they should have been, that investigations were frustrated to protect agents and informers, regardless of their actions. The first official attempt at a definition was made by Sir John (now Lord) Stevens in 2003. Lord Stevens, the then Metropolitan Police Commissioner, carried out a major investigation into collusion in several murders. He said collusion ranges \"from the wilful failure to keep records, the absence of accountability, the withholding of intelligence and evidence, through to the extreme of agents being involved in murder.\" Applying that definition to his three inquiries he reported: \"The co-ordination, dissemination and sharing of intelligence were poor. Informants and agents were allowed to operate without effective control and to participate in terrorist crimes. \"Nationalists were known to be targeted but were not properly warned or protected. Crucial information was withheld from senior investigating officers. Important evidence was neither exploited nor preserved.\" In 2004, Canadian judge Peter Cory published six reports into alleged collusion in murders in Northern Ireland. In outlining his definition of collusion he highlighted several dictionary definitions of the word including \"to co-operate secretly: to have a secret understanding.\" He added definitions of connive, a synonym of the verb collude, including this entry from the Oxford Compact Thesaurus: \"to deliberately ignore; to overlook; to disregard; to pass over; to take no notice of; to turn a blind eye; to wink; to excuse; to condone; to look the other way; to let something ride.\" 'Connivance' From the Webster dictionary, he quoted: \"To pretend ignorance or unawareness of something one ought morally, or officially or legally to oppose; to fail to take action against a known wrongdoing or misbehaviour - usually used with connive at the violation of a law.\" He went on to write: \"How should collusion be defined for the purposes of this inquiry?\" \"There cannot be public confidence in any government agency that is guilty of collusion or connivance with regard to serious crimes. Because of the necessity for public confidence in government agencies the definition of collusion must be reasonably broad when it is applied to such agencies. \"That is to say that they must not act collusively by ignoring or turning a blind eye to the wrongful acts of their servants or agents or by supplying information to assist those servants or agents in their wrongful acts or by encouraging others to commit a wrongful act.\" An inquiry into the death of Billy Wright, in the Maze prison in 1997, took issue with the emphasis on connivance. \"It may be that the very wide definition of the word collusion that Judge Cory adopted was due to his concentration on one of the synonyms, namely the verb connive,\" the inquiry report said. \"We have been concerned throughout the inquiry by the width of the meaning applied by Judge Cory, having in mind in particular that the word is not to be found in our terms of reference. \"For our part we consider that the essence of collusion is an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organisations, including government departments, to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose. The purpose may also be fraudulent or underhand.\" The first police ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala (now Baroness) O'Loan adopted the definitions, in 2007, of Lord Stevens and Peter Cory to examine whether there had been collusion in the murder of Raymond McCord jnr. Using those definitions, she concluded that there had been collusion. Her successor as police ombudsman, Al Hutchinson, applied a less broad definition in his report on the attack, in 1971, on McGurk's Bar. In the report he wrote: \"The essence of collusion requires that a number of elements be present. Not only must there usually be an agreement between two or more parties, but there is also an additional requirement that a sufficiency of evidence exists to establish, on balance, that the act or omission complained of was deliberate and not merely negligent or inadvertent.\" In his review of the murder of Pat Finucane, Sir Christopher de Silva said he had adopted a \"working definition\" of collusion less broad than that of Judge Cory and more in line with that of the Billy Wright inquiry panel. \"I do believe, as Judge Smithwick has said in relation to his Tribunal, that omissions by state agencies must be considered alongside positive acts when drawing a definition of collusion. \"It is, however, important to stress that, in order to fall within the ambit of collusion, such omissions must be classified as deliberate and not merely represent examples of incompetence or inefficiency. \"My own working definition, whilst not purporting to be definitive, is one I consider appropriate in relation to the allegations made and for the purposes of this particular case. \"I consider collusion to involve: (i) agreements, arrangements or actions intended to achieve unlawful, improper, fraudulent or underhand objectives; and (ii) deliberately turning a blind eye or deliberately ignoring improper or unlawful activity.\" Irish judge Peter Smithwick gave a similar definition of collusion to that of Peter Cory. Smithwick, investigating allegations of Garda collusion in the murders of RUC officers Chief Supt Harry Breen and Supt Bob Buchanan, said: \"While (collusion) generally means the commission of an act, I am also of the view that it should be considered in terms of an omission or failure to act. \"In the active sense, collusion has amongst its meanings to conspire, connive or collaborate. \"In addition I intend to examine whether anybody deliberately ignored a matter, or turned a blind eye to it, or to have pretended ignorance or unawareness of something one ought morally, legally or officially oppose.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the differences in the definition of collusion provided by different people in this article.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The definition of collusion varies among different individuals in the article.

Al Hutchinson requires an agreement between parties and sufficient evidence to establish deliberate acts or omissions.

I was outraged that someone could steal off my mother,\" Sue says. And she is not alone in her concern. The charity Action on Elder Abuse is warning about the dangers of direct debits being fraudulently set up in the name of vulnerable victims. The charity says it's concerned about loopholes and a lack of transparency within the current system. But the Direct Debit scheme says its guarantee means companies that use it to take payments directly from customers' bank accounts are carefully vetted. 'Legitimately' set up After being diagnosed with dementia in 2010, Margaret moved into a nursing home. Three years later, at a point when Margaret could no longer care for herself, two direct debits were set up using her bank account details. Over the next four years more than \u00a314,000 of Margaret's money was stolen to pay the direct debits and it was only after she died in 2017 that her daughter Sue discovered what had happened. Sue began trying to find out what had happened but was told by her mother's bank, Lloyds, that it had carried out an investigation and it had concluded the direct debits had been \"legitimately\" set up so it would not be refunding any money. Most of the money stolen from Margaret's account was used to pay Vodafone, but the company told Sue it was unable to help or provide any details of who was receiving its services because of \"data protection\" rules. Sue also contacted her local police force. It referred her to Action Fraud which said it was unlikely any further action would be taken. Sue described the reaction from her bank as \"disgusting\". \"The whole thing was taking over my life. I didn't know where to go for help, I couldn't sleep. All day long I was on the internet trying to find out who else I could go to for help but there was nothing.\" \"I wrote and explained that my mum couldn't have set up these direct debits. \"I explained she couldn't feed herself, she couldn't go to the bathroom on her own, she was monitored all the time. \"She didn't have the capacity in her mind to think about setting up a direct debit and nobody listened. It was like [I] was being ignored and I had the feeling that because my mum was dead they [Lloyds] couldn't care less.\" Direct Debit offers a guarantee which explains that companies wishing to use it to take payments directly from people's bank accounts have to go through a careful vetting process. A spokesperson for the Direct Debit scheme said: \"The billers [companies] are required to carry out payer verification checks when a Direct Debit Instruction is set up - details of the verification checks used by billers cannot be shared for obvious reasons.\" The safeguards supposedly in place to protect vulnerable people, as well as the loopholes in the system, is something that Veronica Gray from Action on Elder Abuse says need tackling. \"This particular case highlights a lack of transparency in how the system operates. This level of passing the buck when elderly or vulnerable people fall between the gaps is just not good enough. \"The Financial Abuse Code of Practice, which is a voluntary code but which many banks have signed up to, is very clear about how financial institutions should treat vulnerable customers. Clearly this has not been used in this case. \"[Bank] staff are struggling to know what signs to look for and clearly don't have the skills to and expertise to identify patterns of abuse when they see them.\" When it was contacted by BBC Money Box, Lloyds started a new investigation which concluded that its initial response was wrong and it would be refunding all of Margaret's money, plus interest and \u00a3600 by way of compensation. A Lloyds spokesperson said: \"We were very sorry to hear of the difficulties experienced by Sue when dealing with her late mother's account.

It also said it would welcome any initiative that further strengthened the direct debit system.

The charity says it's concerned about loopholes and a lack of transparency within the current system. But the Direct Debit scheme says its guarantee means companies that use it to take payments directly from customers' bank accounts are carefully vetted. 'Legitimately' set up After being diagnosed with dementia in 2010, Margaret moved into a nursing home. Three years later, at a point when Margaret could no longer care for herself, two direct debits were set up using her bank account details. Over the next four years more than \u00a314,000 of Margaret's money was stolen to pay the direct debits and it was only after she died in 2017 that her daughter Sue discovered what had happened. Sue began trying to find out what had happened but was told by her mother's bank, Lloyds, that it had carried out an investigation and it had concluded the direct debits had been \"legitimately\" set up so it would not be refunding any money. Most of the money stolen from Margaret's account was used to pay Vodafone, but the company told Sue it was unable to help or provide any details of who was receiving its services because of \"data protection\" rules. Sue also contacted her local police force. It referred her to Action Fraud which said it was unlikely any further action would be taken. Sue described the reaction from her bank as \"disgusting\". \"The whole thing was taking over my life. I didn't know where to go for help, I couldn't sleep. All day long I was on the internet trying to find out who else I could go to for help but there was nothing.\" \"I wrote and explained that my mum couldn't have set up these direct debits. \"I explained she couldn't feed herself, she couldn't go to the bathroom on her own, she was monitored all the time. \"She didn't have the capacity in her mind to think about setting up a direct debit and nobody listened.

It added there were a \"wide range of security verification and fraud checks when opening a new account\", but that people can subsequently change the direct debit details. It also said it would welcome any initiative that further strengthened the direct debit system.

I was outraged that someone could steal off my mother,\" Sue says. And she is not alone in her concern. The charity Action on Elder Abuse is warning about the dangers of direct debits being fraudulently set up in the name of vulnerable victims. The charity says it's concerned about loopholes and a lack of transparency within the current system. But the Direct Debit scheme says its guarantee means companies that use it to take payments directly from customers' bank accounts are carefully vetted. 'Legitimately' set up After being diagnosed with dementia in 2010, Margaret moved into a nursing home. Three years later, at a point when Margaret could no longer care for herself, two direct debits were set up using her bank account details. Over the next four years more than \u00a314,000 of Margaret's money was stolen to pay the direct debits and it was only after she died in 2017 that her daughter Sue discovered what had happened. Sue began trying to find out what had happened but was told by her mother's bank, Lloyds, that it had carried out an investigation and it had concluded the direct debits had been \"legitimately\" set up so it would not be refunding any money. Most of the money stolen from Margaret's account was used to pay Vodafone, but the company told Sue it was unable to help or provide any details of who was receiving its services because of \"data protection\" rules. Sue also contacted her local police force. It referred her to Action Fraud which said it was unlikely any further action would be taken. Sue described the reaction from her bank as \"disgusting\". \"The whole thing was taking over my life. I didn't know where to go for help, I couldn't sleep. All day long I was on the internet trying to find out who else I could go to for help but there was nothing.\" \"I wrote and explained that my mum couldn't have set up these direct debits. \"I explained she couldn't feed herself, she couldn't go to the bathroom on her own, she was monitored all the time. \"She didn't have the capacity in her mind to think about setting up a direct debit and nobody listened. It was like [I] was being ignored and I had the feeling that because my mum was dead they [Lloyds] couldn't care less.\" Direct Debit offers a guarantee which explains that companies wishing to use it to take payments directly from people's bank accounts have to go through a careful vetting process. A spokesperson for the Direct Debit scheme said: \"The billers [companies] are required to carry out payer verification checks when a Direct Debit Instruction is set up - details of the verification checks used by billers cannot be shared for obvious reasons.\" The safeguards supposedly in place to protect vulnerable people, as well as the loopholes in the system, is something that Veronica Gray from Action on Elder Abuse says need tackling. \"This particular case highlights a lack of transparency in how the system operates. This level of passing the buck when elderly or vulnerable people fall between the gaps is just not good enough. \"The Financial Abuse Code of Practice, which is a voluntary code but which many banks have signed up to, is very clear about how financial institutions should treat vulnerable customers. Clearly this has not been used in this case. \"[Bank] staff are struggling to know what signs to look for and clearly don't have the skills to and expertise to identify patterns of abuse when they see them.\" When it was contacted by BBC Money Box, Lloyds started a new investigation which concluded that its initial response was wrong and it would be refunding all of Margaret's money, plus interest and \u00a3600 by way of compensation. A Lloyds spokesperson said: \"We were very sorry to hear of the difficulties experienced by Sue when dealing with her late mother's account. While we were not informed back in 2010 that Margaret had moved into a nursing home, it should have been clear when her daughter contacted us in 2017 - following her mother's death - that Margaret would not have been in a position to arrange these Direct Debits. \"We would like to apologise for the distress and inconvenience caused by our handling of this case and have now arranged for a full refund of all the payments.\" Warning signs Vodafone said in a statement that it was also looking again at the case and would be providing the details of an individual who may have used Margaret's account to the police. It added there were a \"wide range of security verification and fraud checks when opening a new account\", but that people can subsequently change the direct debit details. It also said it would welcome any initiative that further strengthened the direct debit system. Whilst Sue is grateful that Lloyds have decided to refund the money stolen from her mother's account she just wants to make sure this can't happen to someone else. \"I really would like someone to be accountable for doing this. You know, for the police or somebody to find out who did this - in case they're doing this to somebody else. \"Lloyds should have looked into the fact that this account had laid dormant for years and then all of a sudden this money is coming out of it - surely that would ring a bell, that something's wrong there? \"And once you say someone's in a home with dementia and these things have happened surely that should mean something?\" You can hear more on BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme on Saturday at 12pm or listen again here.

Where does he work?\" says the confused security guard at the entrance to the headquarters of MercadoLibre, Latin America's version of eBay. By Irene CaselliBusiness reporter, Buenos Aires, Argentina The answer to the official's question is that Mr Galperin is not only employed by MercadoLibre, he is actually the founder and boss - and worth an estimated $400m (\u00a3267m). In defence of the guard with a blank look on his face, 42-year-old Mr Galperin maintains a very low profile. \"I see many entrepreneurs who use their company as a platform to be famous,\" says Mr Galperin. \"For us it's exactly the opposite, we want the company to be famous. The lower our personal profile, the better.\" And so Mr Galperin goes to work at MercadoLibre's main base in Buenos Aires wearing jeans and trainers. And he most certainly doesn't arrive in a chauffeur-driven limousine. Deal with eBay MercadoLibre, which means \"free market\" in English, was founded in 1999 in Argentina, as an online marketplace and auction house. Mr Galperin, a native of Buenos Aires, had been inspired by US-based eBay while studying for an MBA, or master of business administration, at Stanford University in California. Today MercadoLibre is a household name across Latin America, where it is the most visited ecommerce website. It operates in 12 countries across the region, from Mexico in the north, down to the bottom tip of Chile in the south. And for the past four years it has also had its first European website, in Portugal. MercadoLibre has 109.6 million registered users, and last year enjoyed annual revenues of $473m. While this annual revenue figure is dwarfed by eBay's $16bn, MercadoLibre's turnover is growing twice as fast, as more and more people in Latin America gain access to the internet. And back in 2001, eBay itself was impressed enough by MercadoLibre to buy a 19.5% stake. As a key part of the deal, eBay also pledged not to enter Latin America for at least five years. Without competition from the global giant, MercadoLibre was free to go on and dominate in its region. Key car journey Born in Buenos Aires to a wealthy family in 1972, after finishing secondary school Mr Galperin was selected to play for Argentina's junior national rugby team. Instead he abandoned his dream of becoming a professional rugby player, and moved to the US to study finance at the University of Pennsylvania. Upon graduating, Mr Galperin returned to Argentina and spent three years working for YPF, one of the country's largest oil and gas companies. But wanting to instead do something more in the field of technology, in 1997 he successfully applied to Stanford University in California's Silicon Valley. After studying eBay, the idea of creating a Spanish (and then also Portuguese) language version for Latin America was born. Mr Galperin was quickly able to secure his first investor for MercadoLibre - thanks to a very important car journey. A private equity boss called John Muse had been invited to speak to the MBA students at Stanford, and Mr Galperin volunteered to drive Mr Muse back to his private plane. Mr Galperin used the journey to pitch his idea, and by the time they got to the airport where Mr Muse's jet was parked, the private equity boss had agreed to come on board. A number of multi-million dollar investments have followed, but Mr Galperin retains one of the largest shareholdings in MercadoLibre. Mr Galperin launched MercadoLibre when he returned to Argentina, with a number of his friends coming on board, including Pedro Arnt, who is today the company's chief finance officer. Tough economic conditions MercadoLibre had to immediately weather some stormy economic condtitions, which have continued to this day. In 2000 it had to battle through the bursting of the-then global dot.com bubble, and then a year later Argentina defaulted on its international debt, something that happened for a second time earlier this year. Yet MercadoLibre just kept on growing. On 9 August 2007 it floated shares on New York's Nasdaq exchange, on exactly the same day which many commentators say marked the start of the global financial crisis. For while MercadoLibre's shares were rising nicely on their debut, central banks around the world were having to inject billions of dollars in the financial markets to calm jittery investors. Mr Galperin says there is a simple reason why the company has been able to withstand weak economic conditions. \"Volatile economies haven't hurt us thus far because we are much more dependent on the growth of broadband and mobile phones,\" he says. \"Internet adoption has been growing very fast in every country in Latin America.\" Even the company's Venezuelan operation is said to be performing well, despite inflation in that country now running at more than 60%. Workaholic To get to MercadoLibre's headquarters, Mr Galperin commutes to Buenos Aires from Montevideo, the capital of neighbouring Uruguay, to where he and his wife and children moved to have a quieter family life. The flight is just a 45-minute hop across the River Plate estuary, but Mr Galperin also often works from either home, or the firm's office in Montevideo. A self-confessed workaholic, he says he \"never detaches\" himself from the business. \"For me it is not a job really.\" The company now has 2,000 employees, and while Mr Galperin says he demands hard work, he also wants staff to enjoy themselves. \"I like to work with people that I think are as smart, or smarter than me, but also that are fun,\" he says. \"We work hard, but we also have a good time.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the founding story of MercadoLibre and its initial growth.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "MercadoLibre, Latin America's version of eBay, was founded in 1999 by Marcos Galperin, who was inspired by eBay while studying for an MBA at Stanford University in California.

Where does he work?\" says the confused security guard at the entrance to the headquarters of MercadoLibre, Latin America's version of eBay. By Irene CaselliBusiness reporter, Buenos Aires, Argentina The answer to the official's question is that Mr Galperin is not only employed by MercadoLibre, he is actually the founder and boss - and worth an estimated $400m (\u00a3267m). In defence of the guard with a blank look on his face, 42-year-old Mr Galperin maintains a very low profile. \"I see many entrepreneurs who use their company as a platform to be famous,\" says Mr Galperin. \"For us it's exactly the opposite, we want the company to be famous. The lower our personal profile, the better.\" And so Mr Galperin goes to work at MercadoLibre's main base in Buenos Aires wearing jeans and trainers. And he most certainly doesn't arrive in a chauffeur-driven limousine. Deal with eBay MercadoLibre, which means \"free market\" in English, was founded in 1999 in Argentina, as an online marketplace and auction house. Mr Galperin, a native of Buenos Aires, had been inspired by US-based eBay while studying for an MBA, or master of business administration, at Stanford University in California. Today MercadoLibre is a household name across Latin America, where it is the most visited ecommerce website. It operates in 12 countries across the region, from Mexico in the north, down to the bottom tip of Chile in the south. And for the past four years it has also had its first European website, in Portugal. MercadoLibre has 109.6 million registered users, and last year enjoyed annual revenues of $473m. While this annual revenue figure is dwarfed by eBay's $16bn, MercadoLibre's turnover is growing twice as fast, as more and more people in Latin America gain access to the internet. And back in 2001, eBay itself was impressed enough by MercadoLibre to buy a 19.5% stake. As a key part of the deal, eBay also pledged not to enter Latin America for at least five years. Without competition from the global giant, MercadoLibre was free to go on and dominate in its region. Key car journey Born in Buenos Aires to a wealthy family in 1972, after finishing secondary school Mr Galperin was selected to play for Argentina's junior national rugby team. Instead he abandoned his dream of becoming a professional rugby player, and moved to the US to study finance at the University of Pennsylvania. Upon graduating, Mr Galperin returned to Argentina and spent three years working for YPF, one of the country's largest oil and gas companies. But wanting to instead do something more in the field of technology, in 1997 he successfully applied to Stanford University in California's Silicon Valley. After studying eBay, the idea of creating a Spanish (and then also Portuguese) language version for Latin America was born. Mr Galperin was quickly able to secure his first investor for MercadoLibre - thanks to a very important car journey. A private equity boss called John Muse had been invited to speak to the MBA students at Stanford, and Mr Galperin volunteered to drive Mr Muse back to his private plane. Mr Galperin used the journey to pitch his idea, and by the time they got to the airport where Mr Muse's jet was parked, the private equity boss had agreed to come on board. A number of multi-million dollar investments have followed, but Mr Galperin retains one of the largest shareholdings in MercadoLibre. Mr Galperin launched MercadoLibre when he returned to Argentina, with a number of his friends coming on board, including Pedro Arnt, who is today the company's chief finance officer. Tough economic conditions MercadoLibre had to immediately weather some stormy economic condtitions, which have continued to this day. In 2000 it had to battle through the bursting of the-then global dot.com bubble, and then a year later Argentina defaulted on its international debt, something that happened for a second time earlier this year. Yet MercadoLibre just kept on growing. On 9 August 2007 it floated shares on New York's Nasdaq exchange, on exactly the same day which many commentators say marked the start of the global financial crisis. For while MercadoLibre's shares were rising nicely on their debut, central banks around the world were having to inject billions of dollars in the financial markets to calm jittery investors. Mr Galperin says there is a simple reason why the company has been able to withstand weak economic conditions. \"Volatile economies haven't hurt us thus far because we are much more dependent on the growth of broadband and mobile phones,\" he says. \"Internet adoption has been growing very fast in every country in Latin America.\" Even the company's Venezuelan operation is said to be performing well, despite inflation in that country now running at more than 60%.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nThe question of whether or not we are alone in the galaxy is one that has fascinated everyone from mathematicians to conspiracy theorists. By Alex HudsonBBC News But, if extra-terrestrial life forms are abundant in the Universe - as some people believe - why have they not been in contact? From Doctor Who to Superman, ET to Marvin the Martian, fiction has regularly brought aliens to Earth as friends or enemies but, as yet, no-one has proved they have ever seen an alien apart from on film or TV. In 1960, a radio telescope was pointed out into space to listen for signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence, trying to add scientific fact to the question \"is anybody out there?\" But 50 years on, nobody knows the answer to it. \"It's probably the most important question there is,\" says Dr Frank Drake, who was a pioneer of radio astronomy and is considered the father of Seti - the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence. \"What does it mean to be a human being? What is our future? Are there other creatures like us? What have they become? What can evolution produce? How far can it go? \"It will all come out of learning of extra-terrestrials and this will certainly enrich our lives like nothing else could.\" Where is everybody? Back in 1961, Drake created a formula to work out how likely it was that we are alone in the galaxy, a formula which still underpins how experts view the question today. The so-called \"Drake equation\" estimates the amount of civilisations able to communicate with Earth. And the figure Drake and his colleagues estimated in 1961 was 10,000. Many argue over the exact figures, as the equation is based on unknowns. But if that number is anywhere near correct then the more pressing question is why haven't we got any firm evidence of their existence? This was a question posed by the physicist Enrico Fermi as far back as 1950, saying \"where is everybody?\" to his colleagues over lunch. It formed the basis of the Fermi paradox which juxtaposes the high estimates of intelligent life and the lack of evidence put forward. This \"great silence\" - as it is often referred to - draws attention to the size of the universe and how alone we appear to be. It is a paradox which has yet to be satisfactorily solved. Astronomers have estimated there to be around 70 sextillion - or seven followed by 22 zeroes - stars in the visible Universe. A recent census of planets said that there could be an Earth-like planet circling 23% of the stars in the night sky. The maths alone is an almost inconceivable headache of scope, size and scale. Phone home? \"We should be prepared\" for aliens, says professor of space science John Zarnecki, from the Open University. Stephen Hawking says aliens almost certainly exist and senior Seti astronomer Seth Shostak has said that the hunt for alien life should take into account alien \"sentient machines\", almost disregarding the possibility that there's nothing to search for.

The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that because of the intricate design and infrastructure of our planet, the amount of coincidences and circumstances that must occur together make life almost impossible. Philosophy Professor Nick Bostrom, of Oxford University, has even posed the question whether humans are living in a computer simulation created by beings with a superior intellect. In this model, other beings would not be created within that programme. But Dr Drake has a more simple answer to why life hasn't been found: \"We just haven't tried enough,\" he says. \"We've looked carefully at only a few thousand stars and very few channels that are possible on the electromagnetic spectrum and that's hardly even a start. \"If you take reasonable or optimistic values for the [Drake] equation, it suggests that right now, there may be around 10,000 civilisations we can detect in the galaxy. \"That's one in 10,000,000 stars. Before we have a good chance of succeeding, we still have a long way to go.\" The Search for Life: The Drake Equation is on BBC Four, Tuesday 14 December, 2000 GMT and then afterwards on iPlayer.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the theories and hypotheses about aliens mentioned in the article.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The article explores various theories and hypotheses about the existence of aliens and why we have not made contact with them yet. The Drake equation estimates the number of civilizations able to communicate with Earth to be around 10,000, but the lack of evidence of their existence is a paradox known as the Fermi paradox. Some scientists argue that the window of opportunity for similar technology is small, while others suggest that with intelligence comes destruction. The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that life is almost impossible due to the intricate design and infrastructure of our planet. Some even question whether humans are living in a computer simulation created by beings with a superior intellect. However, Dr. Drake believes that we just haven't tried enough and that there may be around 10,000 civilizations we can detect in the galaxy.", "output_2": "The article discusses the question of whether or not we are alone in the galaxy. It mentions the Drake Equation, which estimates the amount of civilizations able to communicate with Earth, and the Fermi Paradox, which juxtaposes the high estimates of intelligent life and the lack of evidence put forward. Another popular theory claims that we haven't found aliens because the window of opportunity to have similar communication technology is incredibly small. Other theories discussed include the Rare Earth hypothesis, which argues that because of the intricate design and infrastructure of our planet, the amount of coincidences and circumstances that must occur together make life almost impossible, and the idea that with intelligence comes destruction.

Here they tell how the sport of boxing is helping them channel their excess energy and improve their life skills. By Gwyneth ReesBBC News In an amateur boxing gym in Barry, 14-year-old Levi is tugging on his boxing gloves, ready to join his friends in training. Some are already practising in the ring, aiming jabs and uppercuts. Others are punching the bags or skipping as music plays in the background and the smell of sweat and chalk permeates the air. Levi is a fighter. He always has been. In fact, he has been excluded from school twice for disobedient behaviour. But now he's using the discipline of boxing to channel his fighting spirit in a more positive way. Every Thursday, he partakes in a two-hour non-contact boxing session at Colcot Amateur Boxing Club, designed to help pupils who have been excluded from mainstream school. \"I used to lose my temper easily,\" Levi explains. \"I started a lot of fights and used to mess up the classrooms. \"I used to be really disrespectful to the teachers and felt so down all the time, thinking I was just a naughty kid.\" Once excluded, however, and sent to a pupil referral unit in the Vale of Glamorgan, Levi got diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - a condition which causes inattentiveness, impulsiveness and an inability to stick to tasks. It is also closely linked with underachievement at school, poor social interaction and problems with discipline. \"The diagnosis and medication helped,\" he explains. \"But it's the boxing that really helps as I'm always so full of energy and struggle to concentrate. \"I get excited and want to train my best. \"Anthony Joshua is my role model and I want to follow in his steps. \"But my main aim now is just to get my head down and get my GCSEs.\" It is a similar story for Aalijah, 14. She too has ADHD and her inability to concentrate meant she fell behind academically from a young age, causing her behaviour to spiral. Frustrated with school and feeling like she constantly had to \"catch up\", she was eventually excluded for intimidating her teachers. \"I don't like school,\" she explains. \"It puts me under pressure and frustrates me. \"If I try to concentrate on something, my mind is just blank\u2026 and with the ADHD, I can't control what I do. It's like my body is locked back and in its own trance.\" But if Aalijah struggled with school, in boxing she has found something she loves. \"The boxing really helps,\" she explains. \"It lowers my energy and calms me down, helping me to concentrate. \"After it, I feel a lot calmer and more sensible.\" Aalijah and Levi are just two of the teenagers helped by the weekly boxing sessions. Run by Empire Fighting Chance, a Bristol-based charity that launched in south Wales in 2016, the classes are designed to teach confidence and resilience, improving the life chances of those involved. It is now expanding across the whole of Wales, with sessions due to begin in Rhyl, north Wales, and other locations by the end of the year. Explaining the benefits, coach Nathan Powell, says: \"Many of the kids we see have anxiety and confidence issues and struggle to work with others. \"At the start of the sessions, team activities always end in arguments and confrontation. \"But with work and drills, their confidence grows and they become a member of a team. These kids are also used to failing, so we break things down into mini goals, like building up the number of skips they can do. \"This helps them reach a target and achieve something. It's very important and makes them feel good about themselves.\" A third pupil, Jamie, 11, got excluded from primary school when he was just nine despite teachers knowing about his diagnosis. \"Anger is a big part of my ADHD,\" he says. \"If I get annoyed it takes me a long time to calm down. \"But the boxing helps me get my anger out and it helps me control it.\" As for Jamie Parry, head of business development for Empire Fighting Chance, he believes that mainstream education might not be for everyone. \"Many children need a different way of learning,\" he says. \"We try to boost aspiration by providing good role models in the form of our coaches, and we drop in personal development tips about nutrition and sleep. \"The pupils often see teachers as a negative sign of authority so we try to build trust with them.\" According to statistics from the UK ADHD Partnership, children with ADHD have more than 100 times greater risk of being permanently excluded from school than other children. Roughly 40% of children with ADHD have had fixed-term exclusions from school and 11% have been permanently excluded. Susan Young, president of the UK ADHD Partnership, said: \"Sporting activities, such as boxing, are so good for children with ADHD. \"They learn how to interact with people, adapt to an environment and judge situations - skills that will help in real life. \"Boxing, especially, teaches impulse control and channels emotions in a constructive way. \"People with ADHD have so many positives.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nThousands of students in England are angry about the controversial use of an algorithm to determine this year's GCSE and A-level results. By James Clayton and Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporters, BBC News They were unable to sit exams because of lockdown, so the algorithm used data about schools' results in previous years to determine grades. It meant about 40% of this year's A-level results came out lower than predicted, which has a huge impact on what students are able to do next. GCSE results are due out on Thursday. There are many examples of algorithms making big decisions about our lives, without us necessarily knowing how or when they do it. Here's a look at some of them. Social media In many ways, social-media platforms are simply giant algorithms. At their heart, they work out what you're interested in and then give you more of it - using as many data points as they can get their hands on. Every \"like\", watch, click is stored. Most apps also glean more data from your web-browsing habits or geographical data. The idea is to predict the content you want and keep you scrolling - and it works. And those same algorithms that know you enjoy a cute-cat video are also deployed to sell you stuff. All the data social-media companies collect about you can also tailor ads to you in an incredibly accurate way. But these algorithms can go seriously wrong. They have been proved to push people towards hateful and extremist content. Extreme content simply does better than nuance on social media. And algorithms know that. Facebook's own civil-rights audit called for the company to do everything in its power to prevent its algorithm from \"driving people toward self-reinforcing echo chambers of extremism\". And last month we reported on how algorithms on online retail sites - designed to work out what you want to buy - were pushing racist and hateful products. Insurance Whether it's house, car, health or any other form of insurance, your insurer has to somehow assess the chances of something actually going wrong. In many ways, the insurance industry pioneered using data about the past to determine future outcomes - that's the basis of the whole sector, according to Timandra Harkness, author of Big Data: Does Size Matter. Getting a computer to do it was always going to be the logical next step. \"Algorithms can affect your life very much and yet you as an individual don't necessarily get a lot of input,\" she says. \"We all know if you move to a different postcode, your insurance goes up or down. \"That's not because of you, it's because other people have been more or less likely to have been victims of crime, or had accidents or whatever.\" Innovations such as the \"black box\" that can be installed in a car to monitor how an individual drives have helped to lower the cost of car insurance for careful drivers who find themselves in a high-risk group. Might we see more personally tailored insurance quotes as algorithms learn more about our own circumstances? \"Ultimately the point of insurance is to share the risk - so everybody puts [money] in and the people who need it take it out,\" Timandra says. \"We live in an unfair world, so any model you make is going to be unfair in one way or another.\" Healthcare Artificial Intelligence is making great leaps in being able to diagnose various conditions and even suggest treatment paths. A study published in January 2020 suggested an algorithm performed better than human doctors when it came to identifying breast cancer from mammograms. And other successes include: However, all this requires a vast amount of patient data to train the programmes - and that is, frankly, a rather large can of worms. In 2017, the UK Information Commission ruled the Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust had not done enough to safeguard patient data when it had shared 1.6 million patient records with Google's AI division, DeepMind. \"There's a fine line between finding exciting new ways to improve care and moving ahead of patients' expectations,\" said DeepMind's co-founder Mustafa Suleyman at the time. Policing Big data and machine learning have the potential to revolutionise policing. In theory, algorithms have the power to deliver on the sci-fi promise of \"predictive policing\" - using data, such as where crime has happened in the past, when and by whom, to predict where to allocate police resources. But that method can create algorithmic bias - and even algorithmic racism. \"It's the same situation as you have with the exam grades,\" says Areeq Chowdhury, from technology think tank WebRoots Democracy. \"Why are you judging one individual based on what other people have historically done? The same communities are always over-represented\". Earlier this year, the defence and security think tank RUSI published a report into algorithmic policing. It raised concerns about the lack of national guidelines or impact assessments. It also called for more research into how these algorithms might exacerbate racism. Facial recognition too - used by police forces in the UK including the Met - has also been criticised. For example, there have been concerns about whether the data going into facial-recognition technology can make the algorithm racist. The charge is facial-recognition cameras are more accurate at identifying white faces - because they have more data on white faces. \"The question is, are you testing it on a diverse enough demographic of people?\" Areeq says. \"What you don't want is a situation where some groups are being misidentified as a criminal because of the algorithm.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the list of examples of algorithms making big decisions about our lives.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The article lists several examples of algorithms making big decisions about our lives, including social media, insurance, healthcare, and policing.

It meant about 40% of this year's A-level results came out lower than predicted, which has a huge impact on what students are able to do next. GCSE results are due out on Thursday. There are many examples of algorithms making big decisions about our lives, without us necessarily knowing how or when they do it. Here's a look at some of them. Social media In many ways, social-media platforms are simply giant algorithms. At their heart, they work out what you're interested in and then give you more of it - using as many data points as they can get their hands on. Every \"like\", watch, click is stored. Most apps also glean more data from your web-browsing habits or geographical data. The idea is to predict the content you want and keep you scrolling - and it works. And those same algorithms that know you enjoy a cute-cat video are also deployed to sell you stuff. All the data social-media companies collect about you can also tailor ads to you in an incredibly accurate way. But these algorithms can go seriously wrong. They have been proved to push people towards hateful and extremist content. Extreme content simply does better than nuance on social media. And algorithms know that. Facebook's own civil-rights audit called for the company to do everything in its power to prevent its algorithm from \"driving people toward self-reinforcing echo chambers of extremism\". And last month we reported on how algorithms on online retail sites - designed to work out what you want to buy - were pushing racist and hateful products. Insurance Whether it's house, car, health or any other form of insurance, your insurer has to somehow assess the chances of something actually going wrong. In many ways, the insurance industry pioneered using data about the past to determine future outcomes - that's the basis of the whole sector, according to Timandra Harkness, author of Big Data: Does Size Matter. Getting a computer to do it was always going to be the logical next step. \"Algorithms can affect your life very much and yet you as an individual don't necessarily get a lot of input,\" she says. \"We all know if you move to a different postcode, your insurance goes up or down. \"That's not because of you, it's because other people have been more or less likely to have been victims of crime, or had accidents or whatever.\" Innovations such as the \"black box\" that can be installed in a car to monitor how an individual drives have helped to lower the cost of car insurance for careful drivers who find themselves in a high-risk group. Might we see more personally tailored insurance quotes as algorithms learn more about our own circumstances? \"Ultimately the point of insurance is to share the risk - so everybody puts [money] in and the people who need it take it out,\" Timandra says. \"We live in an unfair world, so any model you make is going to be unfair in one way or another.\" Healthcare Artificial Intelligence is making great leaps in being able to diagnose various conditions and even suggest treatment paths. A study published in January 2020 suggested an algorithm performed better than human doctors when it came to identifying breast cancer from mammograms. And other successes include: However, all this requires a vast amount of patient data to train the programmes - and that is, frankly, a rather large can of worms. In 2017, the UK Information Commission ruled the Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust had not done enough to safeguard patient data when it had shared 1.6 million patient records with Google's AI division, DeepMind. \"There's a fine line between finding exciting new ways to improve care and moving ahead of patients' expectations,\" said DeepMind's co-founder Mustafa Suleyman at the time. Policing Big data and machine learning have the potential to revolutionise policing. In theory, algorithms have the power to deliver on the sci-fi promise of \"predictive policing\" - using data, such as where crime has happened in the past, when and by whom, to predict where to allocate police resources. But that method can create algorithmic bias - and even algorithmic racism. \"It's the same situation as you have with the exam grades,\" says Areeq Chowdhury, from technology think tank WebRoots Democracy. \"Why are you judging one individual based on what other people have historically done? The same communities are always over-represented\". Earlier this year, the defence and security think tank RUSI published a report into algorithmic policing. It raised concerns about the lack of national guidelines or impact assessments. It also called for more research into how these algorithms might exacerbate racism. Facial recognition too - used by police forces in the UK including the Met - has also been criticised. For example, there have been concerns about whether the data going into facial-recognition technology can make the algorithm racist. The charge is facial-recognition cameras are more accurate at identifying white faces - because they have more data on white faces. \"The question is, are you testing it on a diverse enough demographic of people?\" Areeq says. \"What you don't want is a situation where some groups are being misidentified as a criminal because of the algorithm.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the list of examples of algorithms making big decisions about our lives.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The article discusses how algorithms are being used to make big decisions in various aspects of our lives.

Many from the golfing world and beyond are wishing him a swift and full recovery, but some fear this could mark the end of the 45-year-old's glittering career. So what more do we know about the man considered by many to be the greatest golfer of all time? He was a child prodigy As young as 10 months, Wood's eye for a ball and an impressive swing had been spotted by his father Earl, who fashioned him a set of clubs and was his earliest teacher. At two, his potential was already getting wider notice and he was invited onto a TV show alongside the legendary comedian Bob Hope to show off his skills. Just months later, he won a competition for children under 10 - and so began a dazzling ascent through the junior game that saw him win tournament after tournament, collecting accolades and breaking records as he went. By the time he turned professional in 1996, he had won six USGA national championships and an unprecedented three consecutive US amateur titles. The man with the Midas Touch In 1997, a year after he turned pro, Woods won his first professional major, the Masters. He was only 21 and had not only become the tournament's youngest winner and first person of colour crowned champion, but he had also become the youngest golfer to be ranked No 1 in the world. By 2008, he had won 14 major golfing titles, and he jointly holds the record for most PGA Tour wins at 82 with Sam Snead and is three behind Jack Nicklaus' mark of 18 major titles. Along with the championship wins came the sponsorship deals, and his deals with Nike and Titleist in the early days of his pro career were some of the most lucrative ever seen in golf at the time. Over the course of his career, Woods has earned $1.5bn (\u00a31.05bn) from endorsements, appearances and course design fees, according to Forbes magazine. In 2004, his gilded life seemed complete when he married former model Elin Nordegren, the daughter of a Swedish politician and radio journalist, and had two children - Sam, a daughter, born in 2007, and son Charlie in 2009. A man of 'Cablinasian' heritage His father Earl Woods, a lieutenant colonel in the US army, was of African-American, Chinese and Native American descent. His mother, Kultida, is of Thai, Chinese and Dutch descent. The golfing champion told Oprah Winfrey in 1997 that it bothered him when people called him an African-American. \"Growing up, I came up with this name: I'm a Cablinasian,\" he said, to describe his heritage mix of Caucasian, black, Indian and Asian. Woods' achievements in golf have been that much more impressive for a game that has traditionally been seen as the preserve of white, middle class Christians. In his 2017 book on winning the Masters for the first time, he said that, while he hoped his win \"would open some doors for minorities\", his biggest hope was \"we could one day see one another as people and people alone. I want us to be colour blind. Twenty years later, that has yet to happen\". Public fall from grace It began with a story, in November 2009, that Woods had been in his car when it sped out of his Florida driveway, collided with a fire hydrant and ploughed into a neighbour's tree. In the days and weeks that followed, the world learnt that he had been cheating on his wife and was in fact a serial philanderer. The proud champion that appeared to have everything was, in fact, a deeply flawed individual. He took a break from golf, checked into rehab for what was widely rumoured to be treatment for sex addiction. In February 2010, he gave a 14-minute televised statement in which he apologised for his \"irresponsible and selfish behaviour\". Tiger and Elin eventually divorced, and the golfer dated US skier Lindsey Vonn before settling into a long-term relationship with Erica Herman, general manager of his restaurant in Jupiter, Florida. Painful return to glory In 2019, Tiger Woods seemed to have put his troubled decade behind him when he won the Masters at Augusta - his 15th major title, and the first one for 11 years. His victory was watched by his two children, something he described as coming \"full circle\". \"My dad was here in 1997 and now I'm the dad with two kids here,\" he said at the time. But he also described the win as \"one of the hardest\" because of his ongoing back problems, which, between 2013 and 2017 saw him start just 24 events. In 2017, he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence when he was found asleep at the wheel of his car, later pleading guilty to reckless driving. He had five prescription drugs in his system at the time of his arrest. He had been recovering from spinal fusion surgery that ultimately gave him the chance at a second golfing career. Woods earlier this week said he hoped to play in this year's Masters after having a fifth operation on his back in January. \"I'm feeling fine - I'm a little stiff,\" Woods told CBS Television on Sunday. \"I have one more MRI scheduled so we'll see then if I can start doing more activities.\" It remains to be seen whether the man who has bounced back from many obstacles in the past will be able to surmount the challenges facing him after this latest car crash.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the career of Tiger Woods until 2008.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "Tiger Woods is considered by many to be one of the greatest golfers of all time.

He was a child prodigy As young as 10 months, Wood's eye for a ball and an impressive swing had been spotted by his father Earl, who fashioned him a set of clubs and was his earliest teacher. At two, his potential was already getting wider notice and he was invited onto a TV show alongside the legendary comedian Bob Hope to show off his skills. Just months later, he won a competition for children under 10 - and so began a dazzling ascent through the junior game that saw him win tournament after tournament, collecting accolades and breaking records as he went. By the time he turned professional in 1996, he had won six USGA national championships and an unprecedented three consecutive US amateur titles. The man with the Midas Touch In 1997, a year after he turned pro, Woods won his first professional major, the Masters. He was only 21 and had not only become the tournament's youngest winner and first person of colour crowned champion, but he had also become the youngest golfer to be ranked No 1 in the world. By 2008, he had won 14 major golfing titles, and he jointly holds the record for most PGA Tour wins at 82 with Sam Snead and is three behind Jack Nicklaus' mark of 18 major titles. Along with the championship wins came the sponsorship deals, and his deals with Nike and Titleist in the early days of his pro career were some of the most lucrative ever seen in golf at the time. Over the course of his career, Woods has earned $1.5bn (\u00a31.05bn) from endorsements, appearances and course design fees, according to Forbes magazine. In 2004, his gilded life seemed complete when he married former model Elin Nordegren, the daughter of a Swedish politician and radio journalist, and had two children - Sam, a daughter, born in 2007, and son Charlie in 2009. A man of 'Cablinasian' heritage His father Earl Woods, a lieutenant colonel in the US army, was of African-American, Chinese and Native American descent. His mother, Kultida, is of Thai, Chinese and Dutch descent. The golfing champion told Oprah Winfrey in 1997 that it bothered him when people called him an African-American. \"Growing up, I came up with this name: I'm a Cablinasian,\" he said, to describe his heritage mix of Caucasian, black, Indian and Asian. Woods' achievements in golf have been that much more impressive for a game that has traditionally been seen as the preserve of white, middle class Christians. In his 2017 book on winning the Masters for the first time, he said that, while he hoped his win \"would open some doors for minorities\", his biggest hope was \"we could one day see one another as people and people alone. I want us to be colour blind. Twenty years later, that has yet to happen\". Public fall from grace It began with a story, in November 2009, that Woods had been in his car when it sped out of his Florida driveway, collided with a fire hydrant and ploughed into a neighbour's tree. In the days and weeks that followed, the world learnt that he had been cheating on his wife and was in fact a serial philanderer. The proud champion that appeared to have everything was, in fact, a deeply flawed individual. He took a break from golf, checked into rehab for what was widely rumoured to be treatment for sex addiction. In February 2010, he gave a 14-minute televised statement in which he apologised for his \"irresponsible and selfish behaviour\". Tiger and Elin eventually divorced, and the golfer dated US skier Lindsey Vonn before settling into a long-term relationship with Erica Herman, general manager of his restaurant in Jupiter, Florida. Painful return to glory In 2019, Tiger Woods seemed to have put his troubled decade behind him when he won the Masters at Augusta - his 15th major title, and the first one for 11 years. His victory was watched by his two children, something he described as coming \"full circle\". \"My dad was here in 1997 and now I'm the dad with two kids here,\" he said at the time. But he also described the win as \"one of the hardest\" because of his ongoing back problems, which, between 2013 and 2017 saw him start just 24 events. In 2017, he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence when he was found asleep at the wheel of his car, later pleading guilty to reckless driving. He had five prescription drugs in his system at the time of his arrest. He had been recovering from spinal fusion surgery that ultimately gave him the chance at a second golfing career. Woods earlier this week said he hoped to play in this year's Masters after having a fifth operation on his back in January. \"I'm feeling fine - I'm a little stiff,\" Woods told CBS Television on Sunday. \"I have one more MRI scheduled so we'll see then if I can start doing more activities.\" It remains to be seen whether the man who has bounced back from many obstacles in the past will be able to surmount the challenges facing him after this latest car crash.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the career of Tiger Woods until 2008.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "Tiger Woods is a renowned golfer who is considered to be the greatest golfer of all time.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nWomen in the UK who return to work after having a baby continue to earn less than men for many years afterwards, according to a new report. Part-time working, missed promotions and less experience are all contributing to what is being branded a \"mummy tax\". By Emma AtkinsonBBC News So what could be done to level the playing field? Enforce paternity leave Arguably, the best way to make businesses friendlier towards women is to make dads take more paternity and shared parental leave. When dads step in to cover the childcare, mums can return to work, work more hours and earn more money. It also ensures workplace flexibility is an important issue for men too. In some countries the idea of paternity leave has yet to take hold, but in Sweden it has been encouraged since 1974 and there is now also a new incentive for dads to spend a full three months at home. A \"daddy quota\" of 90 days' leave is allocated solely to the father on a use-it-or-lose-it basis. If the father doesn't take the time off work, then the couple as a whole lose the three months' paid leave. Shared parental leave was introduced in the UK in 2015, but not all parents qualify. Subsidise childcare The cost of childcare can be crippling for many families with an average part time nursery place now costing up to \u00a36,000 a year. For mothers on low wages, after nursery and travel costs it can be barely worth working, with the government only covering the costs of some childcare once a child turns three. The Women's Equality Party is calling for state childcare help to start as soon as paid parental leave is over. \"Of course, lots of mothers and fathers want to spend time at home with their young families. But at least 600,000 stay-at-home parents would prefer to work if they could afford to do so,\" says WEP leader Sophie Walker. The party says a free part-time nursery place should be available from when a child reaches nine months, with extra hours on top of that capped at \u00a31 an hour. \"Without bold changes women will keep dropping out of the workplace and men will keep dropping out of their families. This is bad for our economy and our society,\" Ms Walker says. Allow babies in the office When Italian politician Licia Ronzulli took her six-week-old baby to the European Parliament in September 2010, the pictures caused a media stir. She said her decision to bring baby Vittoria in to vote was not a \"political gesture but a maternal one\" because she was breastfeeding. Since then, photos of the MEP with her daughter have documented the little girl growing up attending a number of parliamentary votes. In the US, companies have started to take note, with a \"babies at work\" policy becoming a growing trend. Carla Moquin founded the Parenting in the Workplace Institute after being frustrated by the lack of options when she had to go back to work four weeks after giving birth. She says clear rules and a formal structure mean the office does not become a chaotic scene. Provisions such as making sure parents agree to respond quickly to any cries and setting a \"baby free zone\" for colleagues who want it are essential. Parents must also formally agree not to let their childcare responsibilities interfere with their ability to do the job. In the UK, taxi firm Addison Lee also experimented with the idea, while investment banking firm Goldman Sachs is one firm that helps parents back to work with an on-site office creche. The company says it offers emergency back-up care, an infant transition programme for parents returning to work following maternity leave and full-time care for children up to age three. Let parents work from home The financial burden of running a childcare facility means not all businesses can afford to offer such benefits. But in a world where email, mobile technology and communication are king the other obvious option appears to be working from home. The Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, has called on employers to advertise jobs at all levels as flexible, part-time or a job share unless there is a strong business case not to. Meanwhile, the TUC says flexible working has real benefits for businesses and their workforces with employees being more dedicated and productive. But beware. Not being \"seen in the office\" may affect a person's chances of promotion, and result in a smaller pay rise and lower performance evaluations than office-based peers, according to research by the London Business School and the University of California. Give women a pay rise It might sound obvious, but why not just plug the gender gap by paying women more? In June, the University of Essex announced it was to raise female professors' pay with a one-off salary hike to bring their average pay level with their male colleagues. Vice-chancellor Anthony Forster said other steps aimed at improving women's promotion chances had failed to close the pay gap at professorial level. And the university is not alone. Brainlabs, a mathematical marketing agency based in London, also voted to eliminate the overall pay gap by increasing women's salaries by 8.6%. But does this strategy not offend male colleagues? Brainlabs director Sophie Newton says not, claiming none of her male employees had complained about the new policy. \"I definitely do not think it is unfair on men.

Part-time working, missed promotions and less experience are all contributing to what is being branded a \"mummy tax\". By Emma AtkinsonBBC News So what could be done to level the playing field? Enforce paternity leave Arguably, the best way to make businesses friendlier towards women is to make dads take more paternity and shared parental leave. When dads step in to cover the childcare, mums can return to work, work more hours and earn more money. It also ensures workplace flexibility is an important issue for men too. In some countries the idea of paternity leave has yet to take hold, but in Sweden it has been encouraged since 1974 and there is now also a new incentive for dads to spend a full three months at home. A \"daddy quota\" of 90 days' leave is allocated solely to the father on a use-it-or-lose-it basis. If the father doesn't take the time off work, then the couple as a whole lose the three months' paid leave. Shared parental leave was introduced in the UK in 2015, but not all parents qualify. Subsidise childcare The cost of childcare can be crippling for many families with an average part time nursery place now costing up to \u00a36,000 a year. For mothers on low wages, after nursery and travel costs it can be barely worth working, with the government only covering the costs of some childcare once a child turns three. The Women's Equality Party is calling for state childcare help to start as soon as paid parental leave is over. \"Of course, lots of mothers and fathers want to spend time at home with their young families. But at least 600,000 stay-at-home parents would prefer to work if they could afford to do so,\" says WEP leader Sophie Walker. The party says a free part-time nursery place should be available from when a child reaches nine months, with extra hours on top of that capped at \u00a31 an hour. \"Without bold changes women will keep dropping out of the workplace and men will keep dropping out of their families. This is bad for our economy and our society,\" Ms Walker says. Allow babies in the office When Italian politician Licia Ronzulli took her six-week-old baby to the European Parliament in September 2010, the pictures caused a media stir. She said her decision to bring baby Vittoria in to vote was not a \"political gesture but a maternal one\" because she was breastfeeding. Since then, photos of the MEP with her daughter have documented the little girl growing up attending a number of parliamentary votes. In the US, companies have started to take note, with a \"babies at work\" policy becoming a growing trend. Carla Moquin founded the Parenting in the Workplace Institute after being frustrated by the lack of options when she had to go back to work four weeks after giving birth. She says clear rules and a formal structure mean the office does not become a chaotic scene. Provisions such as making sure parents agree to respond quickly to any cries and setting a \"baby free zone\" for colleagues who want it are essential. Parents must also formally agree not to let their childcare responsibilities interfere with their ability to do the job. In the UK, taxi firm Addison Lee also experimented with the idea, while investment banking firm Goldman Sachs is one firm that helps parents back to work with an on-site office creche. The company says it offers emergency back-up care, an infant transition programme for parents returning to work following maternity leave and full-time care for children up to age three. Let parents work from home The financial burden of running a childcare facility means not all businesses can afford to offer such benefits. But in a world where email, mobile technology and communication are king the other obvious option appears to be working from home. The Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, has called on employers to advertise jobs at all levels as flexible, part-time or a job share unless there is a strong business case not to. Meanwhile, the TUC says flexible working has real benefits for businesses and their workforces with employees being more dedicated and productive. But beware. Not being \"seen in the office\" may affect a person's chances of promotion, and result in a smaller pay rise and lower performance evaluations than office-based peers, according to research by the London Business School and the University of California. Give women a pay rise It might sound obvious, but why not just plug the gender gap by paying women more? In June, the University of Essex announced it was to raise female professors' pay with a one-off salary hike to bring their average pay level with their male colleagues. Vice-chancellor Anthony Forster said other steps aimed at improving women's promotion chances had failed to close the pay gap at professorial level. And the university is not alone. Brainlabs, a mathematical marketing agency based in London, also voted to eliminate the overall pay gap by increasing women's salaries by 8.6%. But does this strategy not offend male colleagues? Brainlabs director Sophie Newton says not, claiming none of her male employees had complained about the new policy. \"I definitely do not think it is unfair on men.

Part-time working, missed promotions and less experience are all contributing to what is being branded a \"mummy tax\". By Emma AtkinsonBBC News So what could be done to level the playing field? Enforce paternity leave Arguably, the best way to make businesses friendlier towards women is to make dads take more paternity and shared parental leave. When dads step in to cover the childcare, mums can return to work, work more hours and earn more money. It also ensures workplace flexibility is an important issue for men too. In some countries the idea of paternity leave has yet to take hold, but in Sweden it has been encouraged since 1974 and there is now also a new incentive for dads to spend a full three months at home. A \"daddy quota\" of 90 days' leave is allocated solely to the father on a use-it-or-lose-it basis. If the father doesn't take the time off work, then the couple as a whole lose the three months' paid leave. Shared parental leave was introduced in the UK in 2015, but not all parents qualify. Subsidise childcare The cost of childcare can be crippling for many families with an average part time nursery place now costing up to \u00a36,000 a year. For mothers on low wages, after nursery and travel costs it can be barely worth working, with the government only covering the costs of some childcare once a child turns three. The Women's Equality Party is calling for state childcare help to start as soon as paid parental leave is over. \"Of course, lots of mothers and fathers want to spend time at home with their young families. But at least 600,000 stay-at-home parents would prefer to work if they could afford to do so,\" says WEP leader Sophie Walker. The party says a free part-time nursery place should be available from when a child reaches nine months, with extra hours on top of that capped at \u00a31 an hour. \"Without bold changes women will keep dropping out of the workplace and men will keep dropping out of their families. This is bad for our economy and our society,\" Ms Walker says. Allow babies in the office When Italian politician Licia Ronzulli took her six-week-old baby to the European Parliament in September 2010, the pictures caused a media stir. She said her decision to bring baby Vittoria in to vote was not a \"political gesture but a maternal one\" because she was breastfeeding. Since then, photos of the MEP with her daughter have documented the little girl growing up attending a number of parliamentary votes. In the US, companies have started to take note, with a \"babies at work\" policy becoming a growing trend. Carla Moquin founded the Parenting in the Workplace Institute after being frustrated by the lack of options when she had to go back to work four weeks after giving birth. She says clear rules and a formal structure mean the office does not become a chaotic scene. Provisions such as making sure parents agree to respond quickly to any cries and setting a \"baby free zone\" for colleagues who want it are essential. Parents must also formally agree not to let their childcare responsibilities interfere with their ability to do the job. In the UK, taxi firm Addison Lee also experimented with the idea, while investment banking firm Goldman Sachs is one firm that helps parents back to work with an on-site office creche. The company says it offers emergency back-up care, an infant transition programme for parents returning to work following maternity leave and full-time care for children up to age three. Let parents work from home The financial burden of running a childcare facility means not all businesses can afford to offer such benefits. But in a world where email, mobile technology and communication are king the other obvious option appears to be working from home. The Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, has called on employers to advertise jobs at all levels as flexible, part-time or a job share unless there is a strong business case not to. Meanwhile, the TUC says flexible working has real benefits for businesses and their workforces with employees being more dedicated and productive. But beware. Not being \"seen in the office\" may affect a person's chances of promotion, and result in a smaller pay rise and lower performance evaluations than office-based peers, according to research by the London Business School and the University of California. Give women a pay rise It might sound obvious, but why not just plug the gender gap by paying women more? In June, the University of Essex announced it was to raise female professors' pay with a one-off salary hike to bring their average pay level with their male colleagues. Vice-chancellor Anthony Forster said other steps aimed at improving women's promotion chances had failed to close the pay gap at professorial level. And the university is not alone. Brainlabs, a mathematical marketing agency based in London, also voted to eliminate the overall pay gap by increasing women's salaries by 8.6%. But does this strategy not offend male colleagues? Brainlabs director Sophie Newton says not, claiming none of her male employees had complained about the new policy. \"I definitely do not think it is unfair on men. Women have been facing issues for centuries - it's only now that we are starting to talk about how we can make the workplace a much more equal and happy place.\" Increase the value of low paid work While those in big business are being pushed to publish what their employees are earning, small companies that tend to offer jobs at the bottom of the pay scale are not being so closely scrutinised.

But as Vanessa Speight will tell you, that's sadly not the case. By Chris BaraniukTechnology of Business reporter \"It just comes out of the pavement and runs down the road,\" says Prof Speight, an expert in drinking water quality at the University of Sheffield. It was roughly a year ago that she first reported the problem to her local water firm. Despite efforts to locate the source of the leak, the company has come up dry. \"It's probably been six different times they've dug up the road,\" Prof Speight adds. Across England and Wales, just under 3 billion litres (660 million gallons) of water is lost to leaks every day - equivalent to 1,180 Olympic swimming pools. How can engineers pinpoint leaky pipes and repair them to avoid the sort of problem that Prof Speight reported on her street? Technology, water firms increasingly proclaim, is the answer. Up and down the country, firms are plugging in tens of thousands of sensors across their networks of pipes and junctions in an effort to detect leaks. Sensors have been used for years to some extent but, thanks in part to a push from industry regulator Ofwat to reduce leaks by 16% over the next five years, the number of devices being deployed is currently exploding. United Utilities, one of the UK's largest water companies, is in the process of rolling out 102,000 sensors across its network in the north west of England. The firm has installed 46,000 already. A huge number but Hannah Wardle, network delivery manager, explains it covers just 10% of the firm's pipe network. The sensors use accelerometers, the same technology that detects movement on your smartphone. In this case, however, accelerometers pick up vibrations that may be associated with a leak somewhere along a length of pipe. Other sensors are being deployed too, including acoustic loggers, which listen for the characteristic hum created by a leaky pipe. United Utilities is working with Fido Tech to refine an artificial intelligence (AI) system trained on thousands of these recordings. The system can now pick out leaks with more than 90% accuracy, scoring them from low to high probability. \"For the majority of the high-probability leaks we are successfully finding a leak off the back of it,\" says Ms Wardle. This ability to home in on the actual source of a leak is the holy grail of pipe maintenance. Ms Wardle says United Utilities' system isn't perfect yet but with more data and testing her team hopes to advance it further. The other technology helping to make water pipes smart is narrowband internet of things (NB-IoT) communications - a means of transmitting signals from thousands of remote sensors that uses just a small slice of bandwidth to do so. It means that pipe sensors can send far more frequent updates to a central server without draining their batteries, which are meant to last for years. United Utilities is planning to start using such sensors later this year but some companies are already rolling them out, including Southern Water, which has begun installing 700 NB-IoT acoustic logger sensors around its network in Southampton. They are designed to \"wake up\" at 02:00 every morning, record audio from a pipe and transmit it to a central system. Should a leak be heard, the system can calculate roughly where it might be along a length of pipe, based on the speed at which sound travels through the pipe's material. \"The data gets sent to the software\u2026 which compares it with neighbouring loggers to see if two loggers have heard the same noise. \"It will pinpoint the leak's position,\" says Paul Chandler, UK sales manager at Gutermann, the firm supplying the leak-detecting devices to Southern Water. More Technology of Business Mr Chandler says the NB-IoT signal, which connects via nearby 4G phone masts, gives the sensors an expected battery life of five years or more. Phil Tapping, regional operations leakage manager at Southern Water, says that gradually more and more of these devices will be deployed across the firm's network. Not far away, SES Water, which serves Sutton and East Surrey, is also increasing its reliance on leak detection tech. In this case, the firm uses sensors that measure water flow and pressure in pipes. A dip in flow, for example, may indicate that a leak has sprouted, causing water to escape the system. SES already has hundreds of these sensors in place but is upgrading them all, roughly 500 devices, to use NB-IoT so that data from them can be transmitted every 15 minutes rather than once per hour. \"It's like a heartbeat monitor on your network,\" says Daniel Woodworth, network strategy manager at SES. Again, AI will analyse the increased volume of data produced by these sensors to automatically detect evidence of leaks. The system is due to be launched later this year, says Mr Woodworth, who hopes that SES will have an improved ability to spot leaks before customers report them. Water scarcity is a growing issue in the UK, says Prof Speight. Efforts to improve Britain's leaky pipes using big data and AI represent the \"next generation\" of solutions to an age-old problem, she adds. However, she notes that the sheer age of the country's network is coming under increasing scrutiny. \"It's not in great condition in a lot of cases and it's time to really think about a very large-scale replacement,\" says Prof Speight. \"No-one wants to face up to the cost of that but actually at some point it's going to have to be done.\" Mr Woodworth, though enthusiastic about the new sensors being deployed by his firm, agrees that there needs to be a longer term solution involving the renewal of pipe infrastructure. \"We can't keep putting sticking plasters on our network,\" he says.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the statistics in this article.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "Across England and Wales, almost 3 billion litres (660 million gallons) of water is lost to leaks every day, which is equivalent to 1,180 Olympic swimming pools.", "output_2": "According to the article, water companies in England and Wales are losing just under 3 billion litres (660 million gallons) of water to leaks every day.

But as Vanessa Speight will tell you, that's sadly not the case. By Chris BaraniukTechnology of Business reporter \"It just comes out of the pavement and runs down the road,\" says Prof Speight, an expert in drinking water quality at the University of Sheffield. It was roughly a year ago that she first reported the problem to her local water firm. Despite efforts to locate the source of the leak, the company has come up dry. \"It's probably been six different times they've dug up the road,\" Prof Speight adds. Across England and Wales, just under 3 billion litres (660 million gallons) of water is lost to leaks every day - equivalent to 1,180 Olympic swimming pools. How can engineers pinpoint leaky pipes and repair them to avoid the sort of problem that Prof Speight reported on her street? Technology, water firms increasingly proclaim, is the answer. Up and down the country, firms are plugging in tens of thousands of sensors across their networks of pipes and junctions in an effort to detect leaks. Sensors have been used for years to some extent but, thanks in part to a push from industry regulator Ofwat to reduce leaks by 16% over the next five years, the number of devices being deployed is currently exploding. United Utilities, one of the UK's largest water companies, is in the process of rolling out 102,000 sensors across its network in the north west of England. The firm has installed 46,000 already. A huge number but Hannah Wardle, network delivery manager, explains it covers just 10% of the firm's pipe network. The sensors use accelerometers, the same technology that detects movement on your smartphone. In this case, however, accelerometers pick up vibrations that may be associated with a leak somewhere along a length of pipe. Other sensors are being deployed too, including acoustic loggers, which listen for the characteristic hum created by a leaky pipe. United Utilities is working with Fido Tech to refine an artificial intelligence (AI) system trained on thousands of these recordings. The system can now pick out leaks with more than 90% accuracy, scoring them from low to high probability. \"For the majority of the high-probability leaks we are successfully finding a leak off the back of it,\" says Ms Wardle. This ability to home in on the actual source of a leak is the holy grail of pipe maintenance. Ms Wardle says United Utilities' system isn't perfect yet but with more data and testing her team hopes to advance it further. The other technology helping to make water pipes smart is narrowband internet of things (NB-IoT) communications - a means of transmitting signals from thousands of remote sensors that uses just a small slice of bandwidth to do so. It means that pipe sensors can send far more frequent updates to a central server without draining their batteries, which are meant to last for years. United Utilities is planning to start using such sensors later this year but some companies are already rolling them out, including Southern Water, which has begun installing 700 NB-IoT acoustic logger sensors around its network in Southampton. They are designed to \"wake up\" at 02:00 every morning, record audio from a pipe and transmit it to a central system. Should a leak be heard, the system can calculate roughly where it might be along a length of pipe, based on the speed at which sound travels through the pipe's material. \"The data gets sent to the software\u2026 which compares it with neighbouring loggers to see if two loggers have heard the same noise. \"It will pinpoint the leak's position,\" says Paul Chandler, UK sales manager at Gutermann, the firm supplying the leak-detecting devices to Southern Water. More Technology of Business Mr Chandler says the NB-IoT signal, which connects via nearby 4G phone masts, gives the sensors an expected battery life of five years or more. Phil Tapping, regional operations leakage manager at Southern Water, says that gradually more and more of these devices will be deployed across the firm's network. Not far away, SES Water, which serves Sutton and East Surrey, is also increasing its reliance on leak detection tech. In this case, the firm uses sensors that measure water flow and pressure in pipes. A dip in flow, for example, may indicate that a leak has sprouted, causing water to escape the system. SES already has hundreds of these sensors in place but is upgrading them all, roughly 500 devices, to use NB-IoT so that data from them can be transmitted every 15 minutes rather than once per hour. \"It's like a heartbeat monitor on your network,\" says Daniel Woodworth, network strategy manager at SES. Again, AI will analyse the increased volume of data produced by these sensors to automatically detect evidence of leaks. The system is due to be launched later this year, says Mr Woodworth, who hopes that SES will have an improved ability to spot leaks before customers report them.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nA conflict between the government of Ethiopia and forces in its northern Tigray region has thrown the country into turmoil. Fighting has been going on for almost two weeks, destabilising the populous country in East Africa, with reports of hundreds dead. A power struggle, an election and a push for political reform are among several factors that led to the crisis. Here, we've broken them down to explain how and why this conflict has flared. In simple chunks of 100, 300 and 500 words, this is the story of the crisis so far. The conflict started on 4 November, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray. He said he did so in response to an attack on a military base housing government troops in Tigray. The escalation came after months of feuding between Mr Abiy's government and leaders of Tigray's dominant political party. For almost three decades, the party was at the centre of power, before it was sidelined by Mr Abiy, who took office in 2018 after anti-government protests. Mr Abiy pursued reforms, but when Tigray resisted, a political crisis ensued. The roots of this crisis can be traced to Ethiopia's system of government. Since 1994, Ethiopia has had a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions. Remember that powerful party from Tigray? Well, this party - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - was influential in setting up this system. It was the leader of a four-party coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991, when a military regime was ousted from power. More on the Tigray crisis: Under the coalition, Ethiopia became more prosperous and stable, but concerns were routinely raised about human rights and the level of democracy. Eventually, discontent morphed into protest, leading to a government reshuffle that saw Mr Abiy appointed prime minister. Mr Abiy liberalised politics, set up a new party (the Prosperity Party), and removed key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression. Meanwhile, Mr Abiy ended a long-standing territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019. These moves won Mr Abiy popular acclaim, but caused unease among critics in Tigray. Tigray's leaders see Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralise power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system. The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the central government to hold its own regional election. The central government, which had postponed national elections because of coronavirus, said it was illegal. The rift grew in October, when the central government suspended funding for and cut ties with Tigray. Tigray's administration said this amounted to a \"declaration of war\". Tensions increased. Then, in what the International Crisis Group termed a \"sudden and predictable\" descent into conflict, Mr Abiy said Tigray had crossed a \"red line\". He accused Tigrayan forces of attacking an army base to steal weapons. \"The federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation,\" Mr Abiy said. Ethiopia, Africa's oldest independent country, has undergone sweeping changes since Mr Abiy came to power. A member of the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, Mr Abiy made appeals to political reform, unity and reconciliation in his first speech as prime minister. His agenda was spurred by the demands of protesters who felt Ethiopia's political elite had obstructed the country's transition to democracy. The Tigrayan politicians that led the ruling coalition for 27 years were deemed to be part of the problem. In the 1970s and 1980s their party, the TPLF, fought a war to wrest control of government from a military junta known as the Derg. The party succeeded, becoming a leading member of the coalition government that took power in 1991. The coalition gave autonomy to Ethiopia's regions, but retained a tight grip on central government, with critics accusing it of repressing political opposition. Now the party finds itself in opposition. In 2019, it refused to participate in Mr Abiy's new government and merge with his Prosperity Party. This snub was followed by further escalations. Tigray's decision to hold its own election in September, for example, was an unprecedented act of defiance against the central government. Since then, both governments have designated each other as \"illegitimate\". Tigray argues that the central government has not been tested in a national election since Mr Abiy's appointment as prime minister. Tigray has also called out the prime minister for his \"unprincipled\" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. There has long been animosity between Tigray and the government in Eritrea, which shares a border with the region. A dispute over territory along this border was the cause of a war fought between Ethiopia and Eritrea from 1998 until 2000. You may remember this dispute making headlines in 2018. That year, Mr Abiy signed a peace treaty with Eritrea's government, ending the territorial spat. A year later, Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize. Now it is war, not peace, that is drawing attention to Ethiopia. Thousands of civilians have been displaced since 4 November, when Mr Abiy ordered his military to strike forces in Tigray. Hundreds more are reported to have died, with reports of a civilian massacre. With the communications largely cut in Tigray, the exact number of casualties is not clear. The Ethiopian government has announced a six-month state of emergency in Tigray. A full-blown civil war could last far longer. \"Given the strength of Tigray's security forces, the conflict could well be protracted,\" International Crisis Group, a non-profit organisation, says. \"Tigray has a large paramilitary force and a well-drilled local militia, thought to number perhaps 250,000 troops combined.\" As Africa's second-most populous country, Ethiopia is pivotal to stability in the Horn of Africa. If the conflict intensifies, there are fears it could spill over into neighbouring countries. There have already been reports of missiles fired into Eritrea and 27,000 refugees fleeing to Sudan.

More on the Tigray crisis: Under the coalition, Ethiopia became more prosperous and stable, but concerns were routinely raised about human rights and the level of democracy. Eventually, discontent morphed into protest, leading to a government reshuffle that saw Mr Abiy appointed prime minister. Mr Abiy liberalised politics, set up a new party (the Prosperity Party), and removed key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression. Meanwhile, Mr Abiy ended a long-standing territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019. These moves won Mr Abiy popular acclaim, but caused unease among critics in Tigray. Tigray's leaders see Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralise power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system. The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the central government to hold its own regional election. The central government, which had postponed national elections because of coronavirus, said it was illegal. The rift grew in October, when the central government suspended funding for and cut ties with Tigray. Tigray's administration said this amounted to a \"declaration of war\". Tensions increased. Then, in what the International Crisis Group termed a \"sudden and predictable\" descent into conflict, Mr Abiy said Tigray had crossed a \"red line\". He accused Tigrayan forces of attacking an army base to steal weapons. \"The federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation,\" Mr Abiy said. Ethiopia, Africa's oldest independent country, has undergone sweeping changes since Mr Abiy came to power. A member of the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, Mr Abiy made appeals to political reform, unity and reconciliation in his first speech as prime minister. His agenda was spurred by the demands of protesters who felt Ethiopia's political elite had obstructed the country's transition to democracy. The Tigrayan politicians that led the ruling coalition for 27 years were deemed to be part of the problem. In the 1970s and 1980s their party, the TPLF, fought a war to wrest control of government from a military junta known as the Derg. The party succeeded, becoming a leading member of the coalition government that took power in 1991. The coalition gave autonomy to Ethiopia's regions, but retained a tight grip on central government, with critics accusing it of repressing political opposition. Now the party finds itself in opposition. In 2019, it refused to participate in Mr Abiy's new government and merge with his Prosperity Party. This snub was followed by further escalations. Tigray's decision to hold its own election in September, for example, was an unprecedented act of defiance against the central government. Since then, both governments have designated each other as \"illegitimate\". Tigray argues that the central government has not been tested in a national election since Mr Abiy's appointment as prime minister. Tigray has also called out the prime minister for his \"unprincipled\" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. There has long been animosity between Tigray and the government in Eritrea, which shares a border with the region. A dispute over territory along this border was the cause of a war fought between Ethiopia and Eritrea from 1998 until 2000. You may remember this dispute making headlines in 2018. That year, Mr Abiy signed a peace treaty with Eritrea's government, ending the territorial spat. A year later, Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize. Now it is war, not peace, that is drawing attention to Ethiopia. Thousands of civilians have been displaced since 4 November, when Mr Abiy ordered his military to strike forces in Tigray. Hundreds more are reported to have died, with reports of a civilian massacre. With the communications largely cut in Tigray, the exact number of casualties is not clear. The Ethiopian government has announced a six-month state of emergency in Tigray. A full-blown civil war could last far longer. \"Given the strength of Tigray's security forces, the conflict could well be protracted,\" International Crisis Group, a non-profit organisation, says. \"Tigray has a large paramilitary force and a well-drilled local militia, thought to number perhaps 250,000 troops combined.\" As Africa's second-most populous country, Ethiopia is pivotal to stability in the Horn of Africa.

In simple chunks of 100, 300 and 500 words, this is the story of the crisis so far. The conflict started on 4 November, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray. He said he did so in response to an attack on a military base housing government troops in Tigray. The escalation came after months of feuding between Mr Abiy's government and leaders of Tigray's dominant political party. For almost three decades, the party was at the centre of power, before it was sidelined by Mr Abiy, who took office in 2018 after anti-government protests. Mr Abiy pursued reforms, but when Tigray resisted, a political crisis ensued. The roots of this crisis can be traced to Ethiopia's system of government. Since 1994, Ethiopia has had a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions. Remember that powerful party from Tigray? Well, this party - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - was influential in setting up this system. It was the leader of a four-party coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991, when a military regime was ousted from power. More on the Tigray crisis: Under the coalition, Ethiopia became more prosperous and stable, but concerns were routinely raised about human rights and the level of democracy. Eventually, discontent morphed into protest, leading to a government reshuffle that saw Mr Abiy appointed prime minister. Mr Abiy liberalised politics, set up a new party (the Prosperity Party), and removed key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression. Meanwhile, Mr Abiy ended a long-standing territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019. These moves won Mr Abiy popular acclaim, but caused unease among critics in Tigray. Tigray's leaders see Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralise power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system. The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the central government to hold its own regional election. The central government, which had postponed national elections because of coronavirus, said it was illegal. The rift grew in October, when the central government suspended funding for and cut ties with Tigray. Tigray's administration said this amounted to a \"declaration of war\". Tensions increased. Then, in what the International Crisis Group termed a \"sudden and predictable\" descent into conflict, Mr Abiy said Tigray had crossed a \"red line\". He accused Tigrayan forces of attacking an army base to steal weapons. \"The federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation,\" Mr Abiy said. Ethiopia, Africa's oldest independent country, has undergone sweeping changes since Mr Abiy came to power. A member of the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, Mr Abiy made appeals to political reform, unity and reconciliation in his first speech as prime minister. His agenda was spurred by the demands of protesters who felt Ethiopia's political elite had obstructed the country's transition to democracy. The Tigrayan politicians that led the ruling coalition for 27 years were deemed to be part of the problem. In the 1970s and 1980s their party, the TPLF, fought a war to wrest control of government from a military junta known as the Derg. The party succeeded, becoming a leading member of the coalition government that took power in 1991. The coalition gave autonomy to Ethiopia's regions, but retained a tight grip on central government, with critics accusing it of repressing political opposition.

Jack spends at least a day at the lifeboat stations and the Victorian process he uses is not swift, like the instant click of a digital shutter. An image is produced on a glass plate - coated with chemicals and still wet - when it is exposed to light through the camera. A fixative stops the process and sets the picture - known as an ambrotype. Having converted his bedroom into a dark room at the age of 12, it is perhaps not surprising that Jack has done the same to an old ambulance, called Neena. The process has to be started and finished in about 15 minutes, unlike rolls of film which can be developed later, so he needs facilities to hand. The less light there is - specifically UV - the longer the camera's shutter has to remain open. If the subject moves, the image will blur. \"These are four, five, six, seven-second exposures,\" Jack says. \"It makes for beautiful work because they have a peace about them. \"You have captured a few seconds in the glass. They've been thinking things and their hearts have been beating.\" With exposures of up to 12 seconds, willing participation is essential. An overcast location and the need to walk repeatedly between camera and dark room along a 150m (300ft) pier meant it took far longer than usual to photograph Cromer coxswain John Davies. \"John isn't known for his patience with photographers,\" Jack says. \"But there was a moment after about two and a half hours where he could tell that I was as dejected as he was. \"I just sat down and put my head in my hands and I said, 'I'm really sorry about this John'. \"He said to me - out of the blue, I didn't expect this at all - he said 'don't worry Jack, we'll crack this'. \"This is an eighth generation Cromer coxswain.

If the subject moves, the image will blur. \"These are four, five, six, seven-second exposures,\" Jack says. \"It makes for beautiful work because they have a peace about them. \"You have captured a few seconds in the glass. They've been thinking things and their hearts have been beating.\" With exposures of up to 12 seconds, willing participation is essential. An overcast location and the need to walk repeatedly between camera and dark room along a 150m (300ft) pier meant it took far longer than usual to photograph Cromer coxswain John Davies. \"John isn't known for his patience with photographers,\" Jack says. \"But there was a moment after about two and a half hours where he could tell that I was as dejected as he was. \"I just sat down and put my head in my hands and I said, 'I'm really sorry about this John'. \"He said to me - out of the blue, I didn't expect this at all - he said 'don't worry Jack, we'll crack this'. \"This is an eighth generation Cromer coxswain. He's been at sea since four in the morning. He's the only one in the station. He's just there for the photograph.\" Jack's intention is for the RNLI to own the completed collection of glass ambrotypes, which the organisation says \"would be a remarkable thing\" for it to have. It is committed to sharing them with as many people as possible, through an exhibition, book or gallery, it says. Jack gives the first print from each ambrotype to the station or crew member and pays for the project - and \"puts food on the table\" - by selling further prints to anyone who wants them. With a loose rule of thumb to go north when it is warm and south when cold, he expects to visit Scotland next. And then, one day, after the four or five years his project will take, he will become a lifeboatman, he says. \"I will be. I know I will be,\" he says.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the Victorian photographic method and the process Jack Lowe uses to capture the RNLI volunteers.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "Jack Lowe uses a 110-year-old camera to capture images of RNLI volunteers on glass plates through a Victorian photographic method called ambrotype.

By Jane O'BrienBBC News, Washington The Puritans get a bad rap in America - especially when it comes to alcohol. They are generally blamed for putting the dampeners on any form of fun, and many people assume that it was the nation's puritanical roots coming to the surface when Prohibition was introduced in 1917. But while they weren't exactly party animals, a new exhibition at the US National Archives reveals that the Puritans actually approved of drink. \"One of the things we understand now is that the initial ship that came over from England to Massachusetts Bay actually carried more beer than water,\" says Bruce Bustard, senior curator of Spirited Republic: Alcohol in American History. In fact Increase Mather, a prominent Puritan minister of the period, delivered a sermon in which he described alcohol as being \"a good creature of God\" - although the drunkard was \"of the devil.\" Early Americans even took a healthful dram for breakfast, whiskey was a typical lunchtime tipple, ale accompanied supper and the day ended with a nightcap. Continuous imbibing clearly built up a tolerance as most Americans in 1790 consumed an average 5.8 gallons of pure alcohol a year. \"We think of that as an astounding amount - you would think people would be staggering around drunk, but most people were able to handle their alcohol because it was integrated into daily life.\" says Bustard. This was also a period when most people were working in the fields which presumably didn't require much focus. And living in a tight knit community meant people could keep an eye on each other and intervene if somebody was thought to be overdoing it. Even so, modern Americans look quite abstemious by comparison, consuming only two gallons of pure alcohol per year. In 1830, consumption peaked at 7.1 gallons a year and drinking became a moral issue. \"This was a time of great reform fervour,\" says Bustard. \"Think of the women's rights movement and anti-slavery movement. Another very popular and powerful movement was the temperance and ultimately Prohibition movement.\" Alcoholism - also known as dipsomania - was starting to have a serious impact on communities. Women and children might be in physical danger if the man of the house began drinking. If he became ill or lost his job through drink, there was no social safety net to support or protect his family. In 1862 the US Navy abolished the traditional half-pint daily rum ration for sailors, and by the late 19th Century support for Prohibition, banning the manufacture and sale of alcohol was overwhelming. On 16 January 1919, the 18th Amendment, which set Prohibition into law, became part of the Constitution. Many famous figures emerged from the era - the Chicago gangster boss Al Capone being the most notorious. But the National Archives exhibition reveals details of some lesser-known heroes who fought on the side of the law. Isidor \"Izzy\" Einstein was an immigrant from Austria-Hungary who had no experience in law enforcement. Nevertheless, he made his name arresting almost 5,000 people accused of bootlegging, and enjoyed a 95% conviction rate. Drinking Data The Founding Fathers liked a drink - Samuel Adams was a partner in his father's malt house and Thomas Jefferson was famed for importing European wines. By the late 19th Century, dipsomania, or alcoholism, was being treated as a disease. The first arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol was in 1897. In 1955 the first breathalyser was patented. Americans drink an average of 2.3 gallons of pure alcohol a year compared to 7.1 gallons in 1830. He and his partner Moe Smith often worked in disguise but also tipped off reporters in order to get favourable news coverage. That publicity and their lack of professional experience eventually led to both being dismissed. But prohibition did not ban alcohol consumption and many Americans found legal and not so legal ways to carry on drinking. The speakeasy was born, organised crime moved in and alcohol became big business. The cost of enforcing prohibition itself became prohibitive. By the 1930s it was widely believed that making alcohol legal again would provide much needed jobs and taxes during the Great Depression. And on 16 February 1933, the 21st Amendment ended Prohibition. \"America now has a mishmash of local, state and federal controls of alcohol and part of that is a legacy of Prohibition,\" says Bustard. \"The Prohibition movement was still quite strong after Prohibition ended and it led to a lot of local prohibition on alcohol and state level probation.\" The American presidency has done a lot to rehabilitate alcohol and make it respectable again. Betty, the wife of Gerald Ford may have given her name to an alcoholic treatment centre, but Presidents Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama can all be seen on film drinking socially and making official toasts with international dignitaries. And another exhibition highlight is the silver cocktail set once owned by President Franklin D Roosevelt. \"He had a tradition of having a small cocktail party with his most immediate staff and there were only two rules; FDR would make the drinks - and apparently he made very strong cocktails - and the other rule was that there would be no business discussed. It was a time for him and his staff to relax at the end of the day, so for him this cocktail set had a very positive association,\" says Bustard. \"But I also like to think about what his wife Eleanor might have thought about it because both her father and her brother were alcoholics.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nA new exhibit looks at the history of drinking in America. By Jane O'BrienBBC News, Washington The Puritans get a bad rap in America - especially when it comes to alcohol. They are generally blamed for putting the dampeners on any form of fun, and many people assume that it was the nation's puritanical roots coming to the surface when Prohibition was introduced in 1917. But while they weren't exactly party animals, a new exhibition at the US National Archives reveals that the Puritans actually approved of drink. \"One of the things we understand now is that the initial ship that came over from England to Massachusetts Bay actually carried more beer than water,\" says Bruce Bustard, senior curator of Spirited Republic: Alcohol in American History. In fact Increase Mather, a prominent Puritan minister of the period, delivered a sermon in which he described alcohol as being \"a good creature of God\" - although the drunkard was \"of the devil.\" Early Americans even took a healthful dram for breakfast, whiskey was a typical lunchtime tipple, ale accompanied supper and the day ended with a nightcap. Continuous imbibing clearly built up a tolerance as most Americans in 1790 consumed an average 5.8 gallons of pure alcohol a year. \"We think of that as an astounding amount - you would think people would be staggering around drunk, but most people were able to handle their alcohol because it was integrated into daily life.\" says Bustard. This was also a period when most people were working in the fields which presumably didn't require much focus. And living in a tight knit community meant people could keep an eye on each other and intervene if somebody was thought to be overdoing it. Even so, modern Americans look quite abstemious by comparison, consuming only two gallons of pure alcohol per year. In 1830, consumption peaked at 7.1 gallons a year and drinking became a moral issue. \"This was a time of great reform fervour,\" says Bustard. \"Think of the women's rights movement and anti-slavery movement. Another very popular and powerful movement was the temperance and ultimately Prohibition movement.\" Alcoholism - also known as dipsomania - was starting to have a serious impact on communities. Women and children might be in physical danger if the man of the house began drinking. If he became ill or lost his job through drink, there was no social safety net to support or protect his family. In 1862 the US Navy abolished the traditional half-pint daily rum ration for sailors, and by the late 19th Century support for Prohibition, banning the manufacture and sale of alcohol was overwhelming. On 16 January 1919, the 18th Amendment, which set Prohibition into law, became part of the Constitution. Many famous figures emerged from the era - the Chicago gangster boss Al Capone being the most notorious.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nAmericans have praise for South Korea and Germany's handling of the coronavirus pandemic but give poor marks to Italy and China. What other attitudes do Americans hold when it comes to the global response to the outbreak? The Washington-based Pew Research Center, a public opinion polling and research organisation, took the temperature on how Americans think other countries have handled the pandemic. Pew surveyed 10,957 US adults from 29 April to 5 May for the poll. Here are some key takeaways. 1 - Praise for South Korea, criticism for China When it comes to the response to the global coronavirus pandemic, a majority of Americans give high marks to South Korea and Germany - in fact higher marks than they gave their own country. A majority of respondents gave both those countries a rating of either \"good\" or \"excellent\" for their efforts. Just under 50% of respondents said the same about the US response. South Korea's rapid ability to react to the virus spread and to set up a testing network has made the country a role model as other nations look to battle their own coronavirus outbreaks - though officials have had to respond to recent outbreaks linked to nightclubs and bars. Germany has also won praise for its response to the outbreak. Mass testing and effective lockdown restrictions have helped keep the death toll far lower than in other European countries, though infection rates have increased since its lockdown measures were eased. Americans placed the UK in the middle of the pack, roughly divided over its response. In contrast, a majority of Americans say China and Italy have not handled the outbreak well. In March, Italy was the worst-hit country by the pandemic after China. The US, which now has over 1.5 million known cases, overtook Italy's death toll in mid-April. An overwhelming majority of Americans say the US can learn from other countries about ways to slow the spread of the virus. \"The American public is paying attention to how countries around the world are dealing with [the outbreak],\" Richard Wike, Pew's director of global attitudes research, told the BBC. 2 - Partisan divide over WHO The World Health Organization (WHO) \"is an organisation that probably wasn't on the radar for most Americans a few weeks ago\", says Mr Wike. Now, Pew research indicates a sharp divide when it comes to the American public's attitudes towards it. WHO drew strong partisan reactions from respondents, with 62% of Democrats believing the agency has done either an excellent or good job of dealing with the pandemic - with just 28% of Republicans agreeing. There was also a divide when it came to trusting information on the virus coming from the WHO. About one-third of Republicans said they trusted WHO information versus 80% of Democrats. That division was even more stark when researchers polled liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. Of those more left-leaning Democrats, 86% indicated they trusted the WHO. That fell sharply to 27% among more conservative Republicans. US President Donald Trump is not the WHO's only critic - other countries have raised questions about the agency's handling of the pandemic - but he has been the most vocal. This week he accused the agency of having \"consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier\" and of failing \"to adequately obtain, vet and share information in a timely and transparent fashion\". He has also halted funding to WHO, which he has labelled a \"puppet of China\". WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has defended the agency's response. He has agreed to an independent evaluation, which would look at what lessons could be learned and put forward any recommendation. Beijing has also defended its actions during the outbreak, saying the country has acted with openness and transparency. 3 - Coronavirus deepens China distrust The pandemic has worsened relations between Donald Trump's America and Xi Jinping's China. The President has repeatedly chosen to call the coronavirus the \"Chinese virus\", a term that has caused offense in Beijing. Mr Wike says negative views towards China among the American public are the highest since Pew began asking the question in 2005. He notes there has been a consistent partisan divide over the issue but that the numbers have been steadily trending towards unfavourable among both Democrat and Republican voters over the past few years. Americans have long had concerns about China in matters like trade and jobs, he says, and more recently on matters like cyber security and human rights. \"The mix of issues [of concern] has gotten more diversified,\" he says. \"Now coronavirus is part of the mix as well.\" Currently, 66% of Americans hold an unfavourable view of China. They are also distrustful of information coming from Chinese officials on the virus, with 84% of respondents saying they place \"not too much or no trust\" in Beijing's claims. And they are sceptical of China's handling of the virus, with 64% ranking the response as fair or poor. Those numbers skew slightly higher among Republicans and older Americans, who are more likely to say China has not handled the crisis well. 4 - Americans divided over US response Americans aren't just watching the foreign response to the contagion, the survey indicates. They are also weighing how their own country is handling the challenge. Just over half - 52% - are critical of the US response. In comparison, 47% say the US has done either an excellent or a good job in dealing with the outbreak. Respondents were not asked whether they reserved their criticism the federal or state government. They were surveyed on how good of a job the US has done in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. In the US, it's up to states to maintain public order and safety and it has been state governors who have issued lockdown or shelter-in-place orders - and who have since eased restrictions to varying degrees. The federal government has coordinated the overall response, dealing with matters like fiscal aid packages, testing, and equipment. A number of states have seen protests against the lockdown orders aimed at limiting the spread of Covid-19.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the impact of the pandemic on US-China relations.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The coronavirus pandemic has worsened relations between the US and China, with negative views towards China among the American public reaching their highest levels since Pew Research Center began asking the question in 2005.

An overwhelming majority of Americans say the US can learn from other countries about ways to slow the spread of the virus. \"The American public is paying attention to how countries around the world are dealing with [the outbreak],\" Richard Wike, Pew's director of global attitudes research, told the BBC. 2 - Partisan divide over WHO The World Health Organization (WHO) \"is an organisation that probably wasn't on the radar for most Americans a few weeks ago\", says Mr Wike. Now, Pew research indicates a sharp divide when it comes to the American public's attitudes towards it. WHO drew strong partisan reactions from respondents, with 62% of Democrats believing the agency has done either an excellent or good job of dealing with the pandemic - with just 28% of Republicans agreeing. There was also a divide when it came to trusting information on the virus coming from the WHO. About one-third of Republicans said they trusted WHO information versus 80% of Democrats. That division was even more stark when researchers polled liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. Of those more left-leaning Democrats, 86% indicated they trusted the WHO. That fell sharply to 27% among more conservative Republicans. US President Donald Trump is not the WHO's only critic - other countries have raised questions about the agency's handling of the pandemic - but he has been the most vocal. This week he accused the agency of having \"consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier\" and of failing \"to adequately obtain, vet and share information in a timely and transparent fashion\". He has also halted funding to WHO, which he has labelled a \"puppet of China\". WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has defended the agency's response. He has agreed to an independent evaluation, which would look at what lessons could be learned and put forward any recommendation. Beijing has also defended its actions during the outbreak, saying the country has acted with openness and transparency. 3 - Coronavirus deepens China distrust The pandemic has worsened relations between Donald Trump's America and Xi Jinping's China. The President has repeatedly chosen to call the coronavirus the \"Chinese virus\", a term that has caused offense in Beijing. Mr Wike says negative views towards China among the American public are the highest since Pew began asking the question in 2005. He notes there has been a consistent partisan divide over the issue but that the numbers have been steadily trending towards unfavourable among both Democrat and Republican voters over the past few years. Americans have long had concerns about China in matters like trade and jobs, he says, and more recently on matters like cyber security and human rights. \"The mix of issues [of concern] has gotten more diversified,\" he says. \"Now coronavirus is part of the mix as well.\" Currently, 66% of Americans hold an unfavourable view of China. They are also distrustful of information coming from Chinese officials on the virus, with 84% of respondents saying they place \"not too much or no trust\" in Beijing's claims. And they are sceptical of China's handling of the virus, with 64% ranking the response as fair or poor. Those numbers skew slightly higher among Republicans and older Americans, who are more likely to say China has not handled the crisis well. 4 - Americans divided over US response Americans aren't just watching the foreign response to the contagion, the survey indicates. They are also weighing how their own country is handling the challenge. Just over half - 52% - are critical of the US response. In comparison, 47% say the US has done either an excellent or a good job in dealing with the outbreak. Respondents were not asked whether they reserved their criticism the federal or state government. They were surveyed on how good of a job the US has done in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. In the US, it's up to states to maintain public order and safety and it has been state governors who have issued lockdown or shelter-in-place orders - and who have since eased restrictions to varying degrees. The federal government has coordinated the overall response, dealing with matters like fiscal aid packages, testing, and equipment.

South Korea's rapid ability to react to the virus spread and to set up a testing network has made the country a role model as other nations look to battle their own coronavirus outbreaks - though officials have had to respond to recent outbreaks linked to nightclubs and bars. Germany has also won praise for its response to the outbreak. Mass testing and effective lockdown restrictions have helped keep the death toll far lower than in other European countries, though infection rates have increased since its lockdown measures were eased. Americans placed the UK in the middle of the pack, roughly divided over its response. In contrast, a majority of Americans say China and Italy have not handled the outbreak well. In March, Italy was the worst-hit country by the pandemic after China. The US, which now has over 1.5 million known cases, overtook Italy's death toll in mid-April. An overwhelming majority of Americans say the US can learn from other countries about ways to slow the spread of the virus. \"The American public is paying attention to how countries around the world are dealing with [the outbreak],\" Richard Wike, Pew's director of global attitudes research, told the BBC. 2 - Partisan divide over WHO The World Health Organization (WHO) \"is an organisation that probably wasn't on the radar for most Americans a few weeks ago\", says Mr Wike. Now, Pew research indicates a sharp divide when it comes to the American public's attitudes towards it. WHO drew strong partisan reactions from respondents, with 62% of Democrats believing the agency has done either an excellent or good job of dealing with the pandemic - with just 28% of Republicans agreeing. There was also a divide when it came to trusting information on the virus coming from the WHO. About one-third of Republicans said they trusted WHO information versus 80% of Democrats. That division was even more stark when researchers polled liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. Of those more left-leaning Democrats, 86% indicated they trusted the WHO. That fell sharply to 27% among more conservative Republicans. US President Donald Trump is not the WHO's only critic - other countries have raised questions about the agency's handling of the pandemic - but he has been the most vocal. This week he accused the agency of having \"consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier\" and of failing \"to adequately obtain, vet and share information in a timely and transparent fashion\". He has also halted funding to WHO, which he has labelled a \"puppet of China\". WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has defended the agency's response. He has agreed to an independent evaluation, which would look at what lessons could be learned and put forward any recommendation. Beijing has also defended its actions during the outbreak, saying the country has acted with openness and transparency. 3 - Coronavirus deepens China distrust The pandemic has worsened relations between Donald Trump's America and Xi Jinping's China. The President has repeatedly chosen to call the coronavirus the \"Chinese virus\", a term that has caused offense in Beijing. Mr Wike says negative views towards China among the American public are the highest since Pew began asking the question in 2005. He notes there has been a consistent partisan divide over the issue but that the numbers have been steadily trending towards unfavourable among both Democrat and Republican voters over the past few years. Americans have long had concerns about China in matters like trade and jobs, he says, and more recently on matters like cyber security and human rights. \"The mix of issues [of concern] has gotten more diversified,\" he says. \"Now coronavirus is part of the mix as well.\" Currently, 66% of Americans hold an unfavourable view of China. They are also distrustful of information coming from Chinese officials on the virus, with 84% of respondents saying they place \"not too much or no trust\" in Beijing's claims. And they are sceptical of China's handling of the virus, with 64% ranking the response as fair or poor. Those numbers skew slightly higher among Republicans and older Americans, who are more likely to say China has not handled the crisis well. 4 - Americans divided over US response Americans aren't just watching the foreign response to the contagion, the survey indicates. They are also weighing how their own country is handling the challenge. Just over half - 52% - are critical of the US response. In comparison, 47% say the US has done either an excellent or a good job in dealing with the outbreak. Respondents were not asked whether they reserved their criticism the federal or state government. They were surveyed on how good of a job the US has done in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. In the US, it's up to states to maintain public order and safety and it has been state governors who have issued lockdown or shelter-in-place orders - and who have since eased restrictions to varying degrees. The federal government has coordinated the overall response, dealing with matters like fiscal aid packages, testing, and equipment. A number of states have seen protests against the lockdown orders aimed at limiting the spread of Covid-19.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize Americans' opinions on South Korea and Germany's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "A majority of Americans praise South Korea and Germany for their handling of the coronavirus pandemic, giving them higher marks than their own country, according to a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center.

But can apps such as Secret - which has just launched on Android - really keep our identities, well, secret? By Kim GittlesonBBC technology reporter, New York Think back to an AOL chatroom. Wait for the modem to sing its song, click the connect button, find a room - and inevitably, the first question you're asked as soon as you log in is \"a/s/l?\" - age/sex/location. In other words: \"Who are you?\" For many people, this was the defining feature of the internet: anonymity. A place where screen names and loose identification protocols made the web, by default, an opaque place. Today, our digital identities adhere ever more closely to our real lives, with Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram allowing real-time and often permanent imprints of our existence. While alleviating one concern - identification - they have created another: is there any way to be open on the internet anymore, without fear of reprisal? That is why a whole host of firms are arguing that it is time to return to, or at least make space for, anonymity. The best version \"You look at all of these services like Facebook and Instagram, and they're all about let me show you the best version of me,\" argues Whisper co-founder Michael Heyward. \"It's essentially this highlight reel - Whisper is about showing people the behind the scenes stuff that we're not always comfortable posting on Facebook.\" Whisper allows users to download an app and then post anonymous statements - everything from \"do you like this outfit?\" to \"I'm worried I suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder\". Users can then like statements they identify with or think are funny. Mr Heyward likens it to the Catholic concept of a confession - but a confession that also operates as a business. Whisper has raised over $60m (\u00a336m) since being founded two years ago. \"I think we're really well positioned to own anonymity,\" he says. Big business But Mr Heyward isn't the only one to realise that both the intrusion of social networks into our \"real lives\" and the Edward Snowden US government spying revelations have led to an increased desire for anonymity on the web. And, of course, capitalising on that desire for anonymity could be big business. Secret, founded in October and launched in January by two former Google employees, Chrys Bader-Wechseler and David Byttow, has already raised $11.5m. Unlike Whisper, it accesses your phone's contacts and only shows you Secrets from friends or friends of friends. It was a hit with iPhone users in Silicon Valley, where they posted juicy titbits, including news of which tech start-ups had been bought for millions and, most notably, broke news of layoffs at Nike. And the app has just been made available in all countries both on iOS and Android. Mr Bader-Wecheseler says that the duo didn't design the app with the concept of whistle-blowing in mind. But now \"we constantly ask ourselves is whistle-blowing important, and we think so\". Marketing gimmick But thinking whistle-blowing is important and promising anonymity are two very different things. \"The problem with apps on mobile phones is that, well, it's a mobile phone,\" says Runi Sandvik, a technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. \"It's tied to you in some way or another and this identifier is often passed to the makers of these applications. So even if these apps on their website are promising you anonymity, if asked or required they will hand over your information to law enforcement.\" Ms Sandvik says that promises of anonymity are thus essentially a \"marketing gimmick\" because \"you don't want to advertise an app that promises semi-anonymity\". And it is not just users who could find themselves in hot water. University of Maryland law professor James Grimmelman notes that Snapchat, the self-deleting photo messaging app, recently got into hot water with US authorities over promises that images could not be stored. \"If users can be identified you cannot promise anonymity,\" he says. He adds that the Nike leak also could cause legal issues, including leaking trade secrets and raising questions about insider trading. Getting swept along That's why perhaps \"it's more about pseudo-nymity - the ability to have a real identity but being able to turn it off when you want to,\" says Dil-Domine Leonares, founder of an app called Breakr, which allows users anonymously join chatrooms based on their location. That is a sentiment echoed, in some part, by Secret's founders, who insist the app isn't all about whistle-blowing. \"Facebook trained us to curate our identity - I think Secret can train us in empathy,\" says Mr Bader-Wechseler. But that assumes - or presumes - that what people have to share is not mean, or slanderous, or just simply banal. One recent Secret read: \"Just spent 45 min trying to teach my cat a trick. He didn't get it. We'll work on it tomorrow.\" Not exactly the stuff that moves mountains. But then again, scroll down a bit and I found \"Twitch.tv is rumored to have been acquired for $1b. Any big paydays for non-execs?\" - something a bit more up my alley as a technology journalist. Scroll down once more, this time on Whisper, and I found out that the ex-wife of a prominent technology executive was now dating. And therein lies the question: are these apps about sharing feelings that can't be expressed publicly, leaking corporate secrets, or, simply trading in something that pre-dates the iPhone: gossip? There's also the less philosophical, more practical issue, the word that is almost never spoken in the bubbly world of Silicon Valley: profits. \"We think about it every now and then but we haven't invested resources in solving this problem,\" says Mr Bader-Wechseler.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the information of different apps mentioned in this article.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:\n\n# Output (a):\nThe article discusses different apps that allow for anonymity on the internet. These apps include Secret, Whisper, and Breakr.

It also mentions Breakr, which allows users to anonymously join chatrooms based on their location. These apps have raised millions of dollars in funding and have been met with both enthusiasm and skepticism. While they promise anonymity, there is still the potential for users to be identified and for legal issues to arise.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nExplanation:\nThe article discusses various apps that offer anonymity on the internet, including Secret, Whisper, and Breakr. The article highlights the benefits and drawbacks of these apps, as well as the potential legal issues that could arise from using them.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\nIn the given article, the author discusses the trend of apps that allow users to return to an era of anonymity on the internet. The article mentions three such apps: Whisper, Secret, and Breakr. Output (b) provides a more comprehensive summary of these apps, including their features, potential legal issues, and funding. Output (a) only briefly mentions the apps and their promises of anonymity, but does not provide a comprehensive summary of the article's content. Therefore, Output (b) is better for summarizing the information in the given article.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

But can apps such as Secret - which has just launched on Android - really keep our identities, well, secret? By Kim GittlesonBBC technology reporter, New York Think back to an AOL chatroom. Wait for the modem to sing its song, click the connect button, find a room - and inevitably, the first question you're asked as soon as you log in is \"a/s/l?\" - age/sex/location. In other words: \"Who are you?\" For many people, this was the defining feature of the internet: anonymity. A place where screen names and loose identification protocols made the web, by default, an opaque place. Today, our digital identities adhere ever more closely to our real lives, with Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram allowing real-time and often permanent imprints of our existence. While alleviating one concern - identification - they have created another: is there any way to be open on the internet anymore, without fear of reprisal? That is why a whole host of firms are arguing that it is time to return to, or at least make space for, anonymity. The best version \"You look at all of these services like Facebook and Instagram, and they're all about let me show you the best version of me,\" argues Whisper co-founder Michael Heyward. \"It's essentially this highlight reel - Whisper is about showing people the behind the scenes stuff that we're not always comfortable posting on Facebook.\" Whisper allows users to download an app and then post anonymous statements - everything from \"do you like this outfit?\" to \"I'm worried I suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder\". Users can then like statements they identify with or think are funny. Mr Heyward likens it to the Catholic concept of a confession - but a confession that also operates as a business. Whisper has raised over $60m (\u00a336m) since being founded two years ago. \"I think we're really well positioned to own anonymity,\" he says. Big business But Mr Heyward isn't the only one to realise that both the intrusion of social networks into our \"real lives\" and the Edward Snowden US government spying revelations have led to an increased desire for anonymity on the web. And, of course, capitalising on that desire for anonymity could be big business. Secret, founded in October and launched in January by two former Google employees, Chrys Bader-Wechseler and David Byttow, has already raised $11.5m. Unlike Whisper, it accesses your phone's contacts and only shows you Secrets from friends or friends of friends. It was a hit with iPhone users in Silicon Valley, where they posted juicy titbits, including news of which tech start-ups had been bought for millions and, most notably, broke news of layoffs at Nike. And the app has just been made available in all countries both on iOS and Android. Mr Bader-Wecheseler says that the duo didn't design the app with the concept of whistle-blowing in mind. But now \"we constantly ask ourselves is whistle-blowing important, and we think so\". Marketing gimmick But thinking whistle-blowing is important and promising anonymity are two very different things. \"The problem with apps on mobile phones is that, well, it's a mobile phone,\" says Runi Sandvik, a technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. \"It's tied to you in some way or another and this identifier is often passed to the makers of these applications. So even if these apps on their website are promising you anonymity, if asked or required they will hand over your information to law enforcement.\" Ms Sandvik says that promises of anonymity are thus essentially a \"marketing gimmick\" because \"you don't want to advertise an app that promises semi-anonymity\". And it is not just users who could find themselves in hot water. University of Maryland law professor James Grimmelman notes that Snapchat, the self-deleting photo messaging app, recently got into hot water with US authorities over promises that images could not be stored. \"If users can be identified you cannot promise anonymity,\" he says. He adds that the Nike leak also could cause legal issues, including leaking trade secrets and raising questions about insider trading. Getting swept along That's why perhaps \"it's more about pseudo-nymity - the ability to have a real identity but being able to turn it off when you want to,\" says Dil-Domine Leonares, founder of an app called Breakr, which allows users anonymously join chatrooms based on their location. That is a sentiment echoed, in some part, by Secret's founders, who insist the app isn't all about whistle-blowing. \"Facebook trained us to curate our identity - I think Secret can train us in empathy,\" says Mr Bader-Wechseler. But that assumes - or presumes - that what people have to share is not mean, or slanderous, or just simply banal. One recent Secret read: \"Just spent 45 min trying to teach my cat a trick. He didn't get it. We'll work on it tomorrow.\" Not exactly the stuff that moves mountains. But then again, scroll down a bit and I found \"Twitch.tv is rumored to have been acquired for $1b. Any big paydays for non-execs?\" - something a bit more up my alley as a technology journalist. Scroll down once more, this time on Whisper, and I found out that the ex-wife of a prominent technology executive was now dating. And therein lies the question: are these apps about sharing feelings that can't be expressed publicly, leaking corporate secrets, or, simply trading in something that pre-dates the iPhone: gossip? There's also the less philosophical, more practical issue, the word that is almost never spoken in the bubbly world of Silicon Valley: profits. \"We think about it every now and then but we haven't invested resources in solving this problem,\" says Mr Bader-Wechseler.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the information of different apps mentioned in this article.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The article discusses different apps that allow for anonymity on the internet.

But can apps such as Secret - which has just launched on Android - really keep our identities, well, secret? By Kim GittlesonBBC technology reporter, New York Think back to an AOL chatroom. Wait for the modem to sing its song, click the connect button, find a room - and inevitably, the first question you're asked as soon as you log in is \"a/s/l?\" - age/sex/location. In other words: \"Who are you?\" For many people, this was the defining feature of the internet: anonymity. A place where screen names and loose identification protocols made the web, by default, an opaque place. Today, our digital identities adhere ever more closely to our real lives, with Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram allowing real-time and often permanent imprints of our existence. While alleviating one concern - identification - they have created another: is there any way to be open on the internet anymore, without fear of reprisal? That is why a whole host of firms are arguing that it is time to return to, or at least make space for, anonymity. The best version \"You look at all of these services like Facebook and Instagram, and they're all about let me show you the best version of me,\" argues Whisper co-founder Michael Heyward. \"It's essentially this highlight reel - Whisper is about showing people the behind the scenes stuff that we're not always comfortable posting on Facebook.\" Whisper allows users to download an app and then post anonymous statements - everything from \"do you like this outfit?\" to \"I'm worried I suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder\". Users can then like statements they identify with or think are funny. Mr Heyward likens it to the Catholic concept of a confession - but a confession that also operates as a business. Whisper has raised over $60m (\u00a336m) since being founded two years ago. \"I think we're really well positioned to own anonymity,\" he says. Big business But Mr Heyward isn't the only one to realise that both the intrusion of social networks into our \"real lives\" and the Edward Snowden US government spying revelations have led to an increased desire for anonymity on the web. And, of course, capitalising on that desire for anonymity could be big business. Secret, founded in October and launched in January by two former Google employees, Chrys Bader-Wechseler and David Byttow, has already raised $11.5m. Unlike Whisper, it accesses your phone's contacts and only shows you Secrets from friends or friends of friends.

And the app has just been made available in all countries both on iOS and Android. Mr Bader-Wecheseler says that the duo didn't design the app with the concept of whistle-blowing in mind. But now \"we constantly ask ourselves is whistle-blowing important, and we think so\".

So even if these apps on their website are promising you anonymity, if asked or required they will hand over your information to law enforcement.\" Ms Sandvik says that promises of anonymity are thus essentially a \"marketing gimmick\" because \"you don't want to advertise an app that promises semi-anonymity\".

Unlike Whisper, it accesses your phone's contacts and only shows you Secrets from friends or friends of friends. It was a hit with iPhone users in Silicon Valley, where they posted juicy titbits, including news of which tech start-ups had been bought for millions and, most notably, broke news of layoffs at Nike. And the app has just been made available in all countries both on iOS and Android. Mr Bader-Wecheseler says that the duo didn't design the app with the concept of whistle-blowing in mind. But now \"we constantly ask ourselves is whistle-blowing important, and we think so\". Marketing gimmick But thinking whistle-blowing is important and promising anonymity are two very different things. \"The problem with apps on mobile phones is that, well, it's a mobile phone,\" says Runi Sandvik, a technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. \"It's tied to you in some way or another and this identifier is often passed to the makers of these applications. So even if these apps on their website are promising you anonymity, if asked or required they will hand over your information to law enforcement.\" Ms Sandvik says that promises of anonymity are thus essentially a \"marketing gimmick\" because \"you don't want to advertise an app that promises semi-anonymity\". And it is not just users who could find themselves in hot water. University of Maryland law professor James Grimmelman notes that Snapchat, the self-deleting photo messaging app, recently got into hot water with US authorities over promises that images could not be stored. \"If users can be identified you cannot promise anonymity,\" he says. He adds that the Nike leak also could cause legal issues, including leaking trade secrets and raising questions about insider trading. Getting swept along That's why perhaps \"it's more about pseudo-nymity - the ability to have a real identity but being able to turn it off when you want to,\" says Dil-Domine Leonares, founder of an app called Breakr, which allows users anonymously join chatrooms based on their location. That is a sentiment echoed, in some part, by Secret's founders, who insist the app isn't all about whistle-blowing. \"Facebook trained us to curate our identity - I think Secret can train us in empathy,\" says Mr Bader-Wechseler. But that assumes - or presumes - that what people have to share is not mean, or slanderous, or just simply banal. One recent Secret read: \"Just spent 45 min trying to teach my cat a trick. He didn't get it. We'll work on it tomorrow.\" Not exactly the stuff that moves mountains. But then again, scroll down a bit and I found \"Twitch.tv is rumored to have been acquired for $1b. Any big paydays for non-execs?\" - something a bit more up my alley as a technology journalist. Scroll down once more, this time on Whisper, and I found out that the ex-wife of a prominent technology executive was now dating. And therein lies the question: are these apps about sharing feelings that can't be expressed publicly, leaking corporate secrets, or, simply trading in something that pre-dates the iPhone: gossip? There's also the less philosophical, more practical issue, the word that is almost never spoken in the bubbly world of Silicon Valley: profits. \"We think about it every now and then but we haven't invested resources in solving this problem,\" says Mr Bader-Wechseler.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the information of different apps mentioned in this article.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The article discusses the increasing desire for anonymity on the internet due to the intrusion of social networks into our real lives and the Edward Snowden US government spying revelations.

Whisper has raised over $60m (\u00a336m) since being founded two years ago. \"I think we're really well positioned to own anonymity,\" he says. Big business But Mr Heyward isn't the only one to realise that both the intrusion of social networks into our \"real lives\" and the Edward Snowden US government spying revelations have led to an increased desire for anonymity on the web. And, of course, capitalising on that desire for anonymity could be big business. Secret, founded in October and launched in January by two former Google employees, Chrys Bader-Wechseler and David Byttow, has already raised $11.5m. Unlike Whisper, it accesses your phone's contacts and only shows you Secrets from friends or friends of friends. It was a hit with iPhone users in Silicon Valley, where they posted juicy titbits, including news of which tech start-ups had been bought for millions and, most notably, broke news of layoffs at Nike. And the app has just been made available in all countries both on iOS and Android. Mr Bader-Wecheseler says that the duo didn't design the app with the concept of whistle-blowing in mind. But now \"we constantly ask ourselves is whistle-blowing important, and we think so\". Marketing gimmick But thinking whistle-blowing is important and promising anonymity are two very different things. \"The problem with apps on mobile phones is that, well, it's a mobile phone,\" says Runi Sandvik, a technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. \"It's tied to you in some way or another and this identifier is often passed to the makers of these applications. So even if these apps on their website are promising you anonymity, if asked or required they will hand over your information to law enforcement.\" Ms Sandvik says that promises of anonymity are thus essentially a \"marketing gimmick\" because \"you don't want to advertise an app that promises semi-anonymity\". And it is not just users who could find themselves in hot water. University of Maryland law professor James Grimmelman notes that Snapchat, the self-deleting photo messaging app, recently got into hot water with US authorities over promises that images could not be stored. \"If users can be identified you cannot promise anonymity,\" he says. He adds that the Nike leak also could cause legal issues, including leaking trade secrets and raising questions about insider trading. Getting swept along That's why perhaps \"it's more about pseudo-nymity - the ability to have a real identity but being able to turn it off when you want to,\" says Dil-Domine Leonares, founder of an app called Breakr, which allows users anonymously join chatrooms based on their location. That is a sentiment echoed, in some part, by Secret's founders, who insist the app isn't all about whistle-blowing. \"Facebook trained us to curate our identity - I think Secret can train us in empathy,\" says Mr Bader-Wechseler. But that assumes - or presumes - that what people have to share is not mean, or slanderous, or just simply banal. One recent Secret read: \"Just spent 45 min trying to teach my cat a trick. He didn't get it. We'll work on it tomorrow.\" Not exactly the stuff that moves mountains. But then again, scroll down a bit and I found \"Twitch.tv is rumored to have been acquired for $1b.

Scroll down once more, this time on Whisper, and I found out that the ex-wife of a prominent technology executive was now dating.

But can apps such as Secret - which has just launched on Android - really keep our identities, well, secret? By Kim GittlesonBBC technology reporter, New York Think back to an AOL chatroom. Wait for the modem to sing its song, click the connect button, find a room - and inevitably, the first question you're asked as soon as you log in is \"a/s/l?\" - age/sex/location. In other words: \"Who are you?\" For many people, this was the defining feature of the internet: anonymity. A place where screen names and loose identification protocols made the web, by default, an opaque place. Today, our digital identities adhere ever more closely to our real lives, with Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram allowing real-time and often permanent imprints of our existence. While alleviating one concern - identification - they have created another: is there any way to be open on the internet anymore, without fear of reprisal? That is why a whole host of firms are arguing that it is time to return to, or at least make space for, anonymity. The best version \"You look at all of these services like Facebook and Instagram, and they're all about let me show you the best version of me,\" argues Whisper co-founder Michael Heyward. \"It's essentially this highlight reel - Whisper is about showing people the behind the scenes stuff that we're not always comfortable posting on Facebook.\" Whisper allows users to download an app and then post anonymous statements - everything from \"do you like this outfit?\" to \"I'm worried I suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder\". Users can then like statements they identify with or think are funny. Mr Heyward likens it to the Catholic concept of a confession - but a confession that also operates as a business. Whisper has raised over $60m (\u00a336m) since being founded two years ago. \"I think we're really well positioned to own anonymity,\" he says. Big business But Mr Heyward isn't the only one to realise that both the intrusion of social networks into our \"real lives\" and the Edward Snowden US government spying revelations have led to an increased desire for anonymity on the web. And, of course, capitalising on that desire for anonymity could be big business. Secret, founded in October and launched in January by two former Google employees, Chrys Bader-Wechseler and David Byttow, has already raised $11.5m. Unlike Whisper, it accesses your phone's contacts and only shows you Secrets from friends or friends of friends. It was a hit with iPhone users in Silicon Valley, where they posted juicy titbits, including news of which tech start-ups had been bought for millions and, most notably, broke news of layoffs at Nike. And the app has just been made available in all countries both on iOS and Android. Mr Bader-Wecheseler says that the duo didn't design the app with the concept of whistle-blowing in mind. But now \"we constantly ask ourselves is whistle-blowing important, and we think so\". Marketing gimmick But thinking whistle-blowing is important and promising anonymity are two very different things. \"The problem with apps on mobile phones is that, well, it's a mobile phone,\" says Runi Sandvik, a technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. \"It's tied to you in some way or another and this identifier is often passed to the makers of these applications. So even if these apps on their website are promising you anonymity, if asked or required they will hand over your information to law enforcement.\" Ms Sandvik says that promises of anonymity are thus essentially a \"marketing gimmick\" because \"you don't want to advertise an app that promises semi-anonymity\". And it is not just users who could find themselves in hot water. University of Maryland law professor James Grimmelman notes that Snapchat, the self-deleting photo messaging app, recently got into hot water with US authorities over promises that images could not be stored. \"If users can be identified you cannot promise anonymity,\" he says. He adds that the Nike leak also could cause legal issues, including leaking trade secrets and raising questions about insider trading. Getting swept along That's why perhaps \"it's more about pseudo-nymity - the ability to have a real identity but being able to turn it off when you want to,\" says Dil-Domine Leonares, founder of an app called Breakr, which allows users anonymously join chatrooms based on their location. That is a sentiment echoed, in some part, by Secret's founders, who insist the app isn't all about whistle-blowing. \"Facebook trained us to curate our identity - I think Secret can train us in empathy,\" says Mr Bader-Wechseler. But that assumes - or presumes - that what people have to share is not mean, or slanderous, or just simply banal. One recent Secret read: \"Just spent 45 min trying to teach my cat a trick.

But can apps such as Secret - which has just launched on Android - really keep our identities, well, secret? By Kim GittlesonBBC technology reporter, New York Think back to an AOL chatroom. Wait for the modem to sing its song, click the connect button, find a room - and inevitably, the first question you're asked as soon as you log in is \"a/s/l?\" - age/sex/location. In other words: \"Who are you?\" For many people, this was the defining feature of the internet: anonymity. A place where screen names and loose identification protocols made the web, by default, an opaque place. Today, our digital identities adhere ever more closely to our real lives, with Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram allowing real-time and often permanent imprints of our existence. While alleviating one concern - identification - they have created another: is there any way to be open on the internet anymore, without fear of reprisal? That is why a whole host of firms are arguing that it is time to return to, or at least make space for, anonymity.

Users can then like statements they identify with or think are funny. Mr Heyward likens it to the Catholic concept of a confession - but a confession that also operates as a business. Whisper has raised over $60m (\u00a336m) since being founded two years ago. \"I think we're really well positioned to own anonymity,\" he says. Big business But Mr Heyward isn't the only one to realise that both the intrusion of social networks into our \"real lives\" and the Edward Snowden US government spying revelations have led to an increased desire for anonymity on the web. And, of course, capitalising on that desire for anonymity could be big business.

But now \"we constantly ask ourselves is whistle-blowing important, and we think so\". Marketing gimmick But thinking whistle-blowing is important and promising anonymity are two very different things. \"The problem with apps on mobile phones is that, well, it's a mobile phone,\" says Runi Sandvik, a technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. \"It's tied to you in some way or another and this identifier is often passed to the makers of these applications. So even if these apps on their website are promising you anonymity, if asked or required they will hand over your information to law enforcement.\" Ms Sandvik says that promises of anonymity are thus essentially a \"marketing gimmick\" because \"you don't want to advertise an app that promises semi-anonymity\". And it is not just users who could find themselves in hot water. University of Maryland law professor James Grimmelman notes that Snapchat, the self-deleting photo messaging app, recently got into hot water with US authorities over promises that images could not be stored. \"If users can be identified you cannot promise anonymity,\" he says. He adds that the Nike leak also could cause legal issues, including leaking trade secrets and raising questions about insider trading. Getting swept along That's why perhaps \"it's more about pseudo-nymity - the ability to have a real identity but being able to turn it off when you want to,\" says Dil-Domine Leonares, founder of an app called Breakr, which allows users anonymously join chatrooms based on their location.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nAs pressure to tackle London's housing crisis grows, a number of controversial views are being offered on how the problem should be addressed. By Andy DangerfieldBBC News, London 'House prices soar'. 'Fears of a housing bubble'. 'First-time buyers priced-out'. These are familiar headlines to Londoners. Each has appeared in the press in the past month, but similar headlines have become all-too recognisable over the past couple of years. London's house prices are rising by more than 20% annually, according to latest Office for National Statistics figures. The city needs 63,000 new homes each year, but only a third of these are being built while a \"lost generation is being ruled out of ownership\" due to \"soaring rents, poor conditions and rising homelessness\", it has been claimed. But what alternative solutions are being put forward to tackle the issue? Move old people to smaller flats One in four children in London live in overcrowded homes, according to English Housing Survey figures. At the same time, thousands of single elderly people live alone in multi-bedroomed suburban properties. In 2012, Local Government Association president Lord Richard Best proposed a radical solution: Building 100,000 homes designed especially for the needs of an ageing population. By downsizing, older people could free up accommodation for families, helping a whole generation of first-time buyers who are priced out of the market. \"We free up lots of family housing, and we look after ourselves when we're older because, sooner or later, those three-bedroom, four-bedroom family houses are going to be too much for us,\" Lord Best said. But how easy would it be to convince elderly people to move out of the home they may have lived in for most of their lives? Peter Girling, chairman of Girlings Retirement Rentals, suggested the government should offer tax breaks to elderly people who give up their property. \"You can't force people to move but you could help them along the way,\" he said. Adopt a European attitude Perhaps we should just face the fact the golden age of home ownership might be over, and learn to rent like the Germans? According to the 2011 German census, only 16% of Berliners owned their own place, compared with 50% in London. \"People in Germany or Paris live in rented accommodation for their entire lives and there's no stigma attached,\" said Patricia Brown, who chairs the London Festival of Architecture. She said following the example of Germany and enabling people to rent better properties for longer could be a solution. For instance, in Germany tenants can only be evicted with a minimum of three months' notice. London's mayor Boris Johnson launched a voluntary accreditation scheme aimed at improving rental standards in May. In order to be approved for the London Rental Standard, landlords are required to meet a set of commitments including \"transparent fees\" and \"improved response times for repairs\". But Labour's London Assembly housing spokesman Tom Copley thinks the scheme does not go far enough. He suggested three-year tenancies \"as standard with caps on annual rent increases\" would make \"renting in London more stable\". Build all over the green belt There is still plenty of green belt land within the M25 and Sam Bowman, a research director at pro free market think-tank The Adam Smith Institute, thinks maybe the time has come to build on it. As of 2010, London had 484,173 hectares of green belt - 3.7% of England's total land area, according to the Campaign to Protect Rural England. Mr Bowman said this would mean \"bigger homes and cheaper homes for everybody in order to give people that space to live\". But Ann Goddard, of Elstree & Borehamwood Greenbelt Society, said: \"Green belt is very important. You only have to look at the English countryside. It's so pretty.\" Ms Goddard, who lives in the green belt in Hertsmere, Hertfordshire - 12 miles (19km) north-west of central London and within the M25 - added: \"We need green spaces for recreation purposes and to make a demarcation between the settlements.\" Mr Bowman suggested a compromise could be reached \"if we stopped thinking of the greenbelt as one single unit and differentiate between the areas of beauty and the intensive farmland\". Penalise owners of empty properties Perhaps there is not a shortage of homes for Londoners after all. More than 80,000 homes in the capital currently stand empty. Last year, councils were empowered to use the Empty Homes Premium to charge home owners 50% more council tax if they left properties empty for two or more years. But the results of a Freedom of Information request published by BBC London last week showed that just 4,399 of the 80,489 empty properties in the capital had been subjected to the Empty Homes Premium. Responding to the revelations, Labour leader Ed Miliband said he was \"deeply concerned\". But Daniel Astaire, Westminster Council's Conservative cabinet member for housing, said: \"The way to build homes is not to tax existing homes and stop people investing and buying in our city.\" Build on brownfield sites Building on brownfield sites - land previously used for industrial or commercial purposes - is possibly the least controversial solution on this list. In June, the Treasury announced 50,000 new London homes would be built on 20 such sites. But Mr Johnson has said the scheme is a \"just a fraction of what needs to be done\". The mayor has said 49,000 homes need to be built in the capital each year, while Labour puts this figure at 63,000. But developers face problems. Brownfield land is often contaminated and expensive to clean, getting planning permission to build can be a lengthy and costly process and putting in new roads and train links can prove tricky. But Lib Dem London Assembly member Stephen Knight said what was important was the type of homes that were built. \"We need changes to planning laws, so the government can determine certain plots of land should be used for affordable housing,\" he suggested.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the option of building more properties on green belt lands as a solution.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "One solution to London's housing crisis that has been proposed is to build more homes on green belt land.

Mr Bowman said this would mean \"bigger homes and cheaper homes for everybody in order to give people that space to live\". But Ann Goddard, of Elstree & Borehamwood Greenbelt Society, said: \"Green belt is very important. You only have to look at the English countryside. It's so pretty.\" Ms Goddard, who lives in the green belt in Hertsmere, Hertfordshire - 12 miles (19km) north-west of central London and within the M25 - added: \"We need green spaces for recreation purposes and to make a demarcation between the settlements.\" Mr Bowman suggested a compromise could be reached \"if we stopped thinking of the greenbelt as one single unit and differentiate between the areas of beauty and the intensive farmland\". Penalise owners of empty properties Perhaps there is not a shortage of homes for Londoners after all. More than 80,000 homes in the capital currently stand empty. Last year, councils were empowered to use the Empty Homes Premium to charge home owners 50% more council tax if they left properties empty for two or more years. But the results of a Freedom of Information request published by BBC London last week showed that just 4,399 of the 80,489 empty properties in the capital had been subjected to the Empty Homes Premium. Responding to the revelations, Labour leader Ed Miliband said he was \"deeply concerned\". But Daniel Astaire, Westminster Council's Conservative cabinet member for housing, said: \"The way to build homes is not to tax existing homes and stop people investing and buying in our city.\" Build on brownfield sites Building on brownfield sites - land previously used for industrial or commercial purposes - is possibly the least controversial solution on this list. In June, the Treasury announced 50,000 new London homes would be built on 20 such sites. But Mr Johnson has said the scheme is a \"just a fraction of what needs to be done\". The mayor has said 49,000 homes need to be built in the capital each year, while Labour puts this figure at 63,000. But developers face problems. Brownfield land is often contaminated and expensive to clean, getting planning permission to build can be a lengthy and costly process and putting in new roads and train links can prove tricky. But Lib Dem London Assembly member Stephen Knight said what was important was the type of homes that were built. \"We need changes to planning laws, so the government can determine certain plots of land should be used for affordable housing,\" he suggested.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the option of building more properties on green belt lands as a solution.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:\n\n# Output (a):\nSam Bowman, a research director at pro free market think-tank The Adam Smith Institute, suggests building on green belt land as a solution to London's housing crisis.

By Andy DangerfieldBBC News, London 'House prices soar'. 'Fears of a housing bubble'. 'First-time buyers priced-out'. These are familiar headlines to Londoners. Each has appeared in the press in the past month, but similar headlines have become all-too recognisable over the past couple of years. London's house prices are rising by more than 20% annually, according to latest Office for National Statistics figures. The city needs 63,000 new homes each year, but only a third of these are being built while a \"lost generation is being ruled out of ownership\" due to \"soaring rents, poor conditions and rising homelessness\", it has been claimed. But what alternative solutions are being put forward to tackle the issue? Move old people to smaller flats One in four children in London live in overcrowded homes, according to English Housing Survey figures. At the same time, thousands of single elderly people live alone in multi-bedroomed suburban properties. In 2012, Local Government Association president Lord Richard Best proposed a radical solution: Building 100,000 homes designed especially for the needs of an ageing population. By downsizing, older people could free up accommodation for families, helping a whole generation of first-time buyers who are priced out of the market. \"We free up lots of family housing, and we look after ourselves when we're older because, sooner or later, those three-bedroom, four-bedroom family houses are going to be too much for us,\" Lord Best said. But how easy would it be to convince elderly people to move out of the home they may have lived in for most of their lives? Peter Girling, chairman of Girlings Retirement Rentals, suggested the government should offer tax breaks to elderly people who give up their property. \"You can't force people to move but you could help them along the way,\" he said. Adopt a European attitude Perhaps we should just face the fact the golden age of home ownership might be over, and learn to rent like the Germans? According to the 2011 German census, only 16% of Berliners owned their own place, compared with 50% in London. \"People in Germany or Paris live in rented accommodation for their entire lives and there's no stigma attached,\" said Patricia Brown, who chairs the London Festival of Architecture. She said following the example of Germany and enabling people to rent better properties for longer could be a solution. For instance, in Germany tenants can only be evicted with a minimum of three months' notice. London's mayor Boris Johnson launched a voluntary accreditation scheme aimed at improving rental standards in May. In order to be approved for the London Rental Standard, landlords are required to meet a set of commitments including \"transparent fees\" and \"improved response times for repairs\". But Labour's London Assembly housing spokesman Tom Copley thinks the scheme does not go far enough. He suggested three-year tenancies \"as standard with caps on annual rent increases\" would make \"renting in London more stable\".

The city needs 63,000 new homes each year, but only a third of these are being built while a \"lost generation is being ruled out of ownership\" due to \"soaring rents, poor conditions and rising homelessness\", it has been claimed. But what alternative solutions are being put forward to tackle the issue? Move old people to smaller flats One in four children in London live in overcrowded homes, according to English Housing Survey figures. At the same time, thousands of single elderly people live alone in multi-bedroomed suburban properties. In 2012, Local Government Association president Lord Richard Best proposed a radical solution: Building 100,000 homes designed especially for the needs of an ageing population. By downsizing, older people could free up accommodation for families, helping a whole generation of first-time buyers who are priced out of the market. \"We free up lots of family housing, and we look after ourselves when we're older because, sooner or later, those three-bedroom, four-bedroom family houses are going to be too much for us,\" Lord Best said. But how easy would it be to convince elderly people to move out of the home they may have lived in for most of their lives? Peter Girling, chairman of Girlings Retirement Rentals, suggested the government should offer tax breaks to elderly people who give up their property. \"You can't force people to move but you could help them along the way,\" he said. Adopt a European attitude Perhaps we should just face the fact the golden age of home ownership might be over, and learn to rent like the Germans? According to the 2011 German census, only 16% of Berliners owned their own place, compared with 50% in London. \"People in Germany or Paris live in rented accommodation for their entire lives and there's no stigma attached,\" said Patricia Brown, who chairs the London Festival of Architecture. She said following the example of Germany and enabling people to rent better properties for longer could be a solution. For instance, in Germany tenants can only be evicted with a minimum of three months' notice. London's mayor Boris Johnson launched a voluntary accreditation scheme aimed at improving rental standards in May. In order to be approved for the London Rental Standard, landlords are required to meet a set of commitments including \"transparent fees\" and \"improved response times for repairs\". But Labour's London Assembly housing spokesman Tom Copley thinks the scheme does not go far enough. He suggested three-year tenancies \"as standard with caps on annual rent increases\" would make \"renting in London more stable\". Build all over the green belt There is still plenty of green belt land within the M25 and Sam Bowman, a research director at pro free market think-tank The Adam Smith Institute, thinks maybe the time has come to build on it. As of 2010, London had 484,173 hectares of green belt - 3.7% of England's total land area, according to the Campaign to Protect Rural England. Mr Bowman said this would mean \"bigger homes and cheaper homes for everybody in order to give people that space to live\". But Ann Goddard, of Elstree & Borehamwood Greenbelt Society, said: \"Green belt is very important. You only have to look at the English countryside. It's so pretty.\" Ms Goddard, who lives in the green belt in Hertsmere, Hertfordshire - 12 miles (19km) north-west of central London and within the M25 - added: \"We need green spaces for recreation purposes and to make a demarcation between the settlements.\" Mr Bowman suggested a compromise could be reached \"if we stopped thinking of the greenbelt as one single unit and differentiate between the areas of beauty and the intensive farmland\". Penalise owners of empty properties Perhaps there is not a shortage of homes for Londoners after all. More than 80,000 homes in the capital currently stand empty. Last year, councils were empowered to use the Empty Homes Premium to charge home owners 50% more council tax if they left properties empty for two or more years. But the results of a Freedom of Information request published by BBC London last week showed that just 4,399 of the 80,489 empty properties in the capital had been subjected to the Empty Homes Premium. Responding to the revelations, Labour leader Ed Miliband said he was \"deeply concerned\". But Daniel Astaire, Westminster Council's Conservative cabinet member for housing, said: \"The way to build homes is not to tax existing homes and stop people investing and buying in our city.\" Build on brownfield sites Building on brownfield sites - land previously used for industrial or commercial purposes - is possibly the least controversial solution on this list. In June, the Treasury announced 50,000 new London homes would be built on 20 such sites. But Mr Johnson has said the scheme is a \"just a fraction of what needs to be done\". The mayor has said 49,000 homes need to be built in the capital each year, while Labour puts this figure at 63,000. But developers face problems. Brownfield land is often contaminated and expensive to clean, getting planning permission to build can be a lengthy and costly process and putting in new roads and train links can prove tricky. But Lib Dem London Assembly member Stephen Knight said what was important was the type of homes that were built. \"We need changes to planning laws, so the government can determine certain plots of land should be used for affordable housing,\" he suggested.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the option of building more properties on green belt lands as a solution.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "Research director at The Adam Smith Institute, Sam Bowman, suggests that building on London's green belt lands could provide bigger and cheaper homes for everyone.

By James BadcockMadrid If tourism is vitally important to the Spanish economy, accounting for 12% of GDP, nowhere is it more crucial than in the Balearic Islands, where it represents 35% of the region's economic output. Normally, June would see the beaches of Majorca, Ibiza and the archipelago's smaller islands busy with international tourists, who made up the bulk of the more than 16 million visitors the region received in 2019. This year only got started with a batch of just over 5,000 Germans, given special permission to stay in the Palma Beach resort on Majorca as a pilot scheme to test Spain's emergency protocols for safe tourism in the Covid-19 age. \"We are very pleased with the pilot programme, and our customers have been able to see that holidays are possible with safety. \"People are wearing face masks, there is hydro-alcoholic gel when you enter the restaurant, and in the bathroom the taps are electric so you don't have to touch them,\" says Juan Miguel Ferrer, chief executive of Palma Beach. \"The peace and quiet is actually wonderful,\" tourist Martin Br\u00f6cker told German media. Praising the temperature checks at the airport and extra measures in the local hotels, he said: \"whoever wants to go on holiday to Majorca has to help ensure there's no new outbreak.\" Quieter nightlife as the clubs stay silent Although flights to Majorca are expected to reach levels of 30% to 40% of a normal summer, the atmosphere at Palma Beach is set to remain considerably more sedate than other years. Mr Ferrer accepts that the Covid-19 effect will accelerate the existing tendency towards less nightlife and more daytime experiences. In June the Balearic Islands government announced that nocturnal excesses would not be a part of this summer. There are strict rules limiting opening times and conditions in pubs and clubs, and nightclubs are banned from operating at all in Magaluf and Palma Beach on Majorca as well as Sant Antoni on Ibiza - the resorts that have become notorious for so-called \"booze tourism\". \"There won't be that kind of mass tourism because those places are not going to open; it's a clear message,\" says Iago Negueruela, the Balearic minister for the economy, labour and tourism. \"We had already started a process and it is irreversible. The pubs won't open this year. We are no longer going to receive or tolerate that kind of tourist, who can be a risk for themselves and others.\" Mr Negueruela highlights the law against \"tourism of excesses\" that his government introduced at the start of the year, banning pub crawls and happy hours. End of an era for 'booze tourism'? The current situation can only accelerate the end of what he says is a mere remnant of a bygone age, the minister argues. \"Our hotel sector has already staked out its preference for quality and not just numbers, but the perception does not always accompany the reality. Even in Magaluf, a transformation has been taking place, with a focus on five-star hotels, its beaches and gastronomy.\" Industry leaders recognise that Covid-19 may make crowding a taboo for all future visitors. \"Some elements of this crisis might be temporary, like face masks,\" says Andreu Serra, tourism chief for the Mallorca Council island administration. \"But this is also an opportunity to improve our care of tourists, by using technology to control numbers so we know when beaches will be full, and generally boosting hygiene in all hospitality areas.\" Time to turn away from tourism? Not everyone is sighing in relief at the return of tourists to Majorca and the other islands. Local environmentalists criticise the over-dependence on a sector that has transformed the archipelago's landscape, while creating employment that is largely low-paid and seasonal in nature as property prices and even rents skyrocket beyond the means of most employees. For Antoni Pallicer Mateu, a member of publishing collective Tot Incl\u00f2s that aim to inform on tourism's impact on the islands, Balearic citizens and in particular Majorcans have become prisoners to a sector \"that is so vulnerable to instability\" and whose use of resources is such that almost all other needs have to be imported. \"Now it's a pandemic, but in the near future it could be a climate or energy crisis, or simply a crisis in our main markets of Germany and the UK,\" argues Mr Pallicer Mateu. \"Tourism benefits tour operators, agencies, hotel chains, rental companies like Airbnb, and also a Majorcan middle class who own property and companies. But it is benefiting the working class and small businesses less and less. Mass tourism is driving us towards unsustainability and an environmental and even social collapse.\" In the Balearic high season, the population of the islands usually doubles due to tourism, as the one million residents are matched by a million tourists. Little wonder, then, that registered unemployment in May was double the normal amount for that month, at 75,000. \"We have tourism dependency, and we will for another 15 years at least, because no other alternative has been developed,\" says Mr Ferrer, noting that the non-services part of the economy only covers 15% of Balearic GDP. \"It's a moment of political opportunity to criticise tourism right now, but that's what is paying people's wages every month,\" Mr Ferrer continues. \"I doubt many of our waiters and waitresses who have been out of work these past few months would subscribe to this point of view.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the possible future of the tourism industry in the Balearic Islands mentioned in the article.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:\n\n# Output (a):\nThe article discusses the possible future of the tourism industry in the Balearic Islands in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Industry leaders are hopeful that the return of tourists will help to boost the economy, but some locals are critical of the over-dependence on tourism and the negative impact it has had on the islands.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe Balearic Islands are heavily dependent on tourism, which represents 35% of the region's economic output. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the government has introduced strict rules limiting opening times and conditions in pubs and clubs, and nightclubs are banned from operating in certain resorts. This is accelerating the existing tendency towards less nightlife and more daytime experiences. The government is also introducing a law against \"tourism of excesses\" to discourage \"booze tourism\". Industry leaders are looking to improve care of tourists by using technology to control numbers and boosting hygiene in hospitality areas. Despite this, some locals are critical of the over-dependence on the tourism industry, which has caused property prices and rents to rise beyond the means of most employees. However, the sector is still providing employment to many and is expected to remain a major part of the economy for at least another 15 years.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nExplanation:\nOutput (a) provides a more detailed summary of the article, covering the current situation, the government's response, and the opinions of industry leaders and locals.

By James BadcockMadrid If tourism is vitally important to the Spanish economy, accounting for 12% of GDP, nowhere is it more crucial than in the Balearic Islands, where it represents 35% of the region's economic output. Normally, June would see the beaches of Majorca, Ibiza and the archipelago's smaller islands busy with international tourists, who made up the bulk of the more than 16 million visitors the region received in 2019. This year only got started with a batch of just over 5,000 Germans, given special permission to stay in the Palma Beach resort on Majorca as a pilot scheme to test Spain's emergency protocols for safe tourism in the Covid-19 age. \"We are very pleased with the pilot programme, and our customers have been able to see that holidays are possible with safety. \"People are wearing face masks, there is hydro-alcoholic gel when you enter the restaurant, and in the bathroom the taps are electric so you don't have to touch them,\" says Juan Miguel Ferrer, chief executive of Palma Beach. \"The peace and quiet is actually wonderful,\" tourist Martin Br\u00f6cker told German media. Praising the temperature checks at the airport and extra measures in the local hotels, he said: \"whoever wants to go on holiday to Majorca has to help ensure there's no new outbreak.\" Quieter nightlife as the clubs stay silent Although flights to Majorca are expected to reach levels of 30% to 40% of a normal summer, the atmosphere at Palma Beach is set to remain considerably more sedate than other years. Mr Ferrer accepts that the Covid-19 effect will accelerate the existing tendency towards less nightlife and more daytime experiences. In June the Balearic Islands government announced that nocturnal excesses would not be a part of this summer. There are strict rules limiting opening times and conditions in pubs and clubs, and nightclubs are banned from operating at all in Magaluf and Palma Beach on Majorca as well as Sant Antoni on Ibiza - the resorts that have become notorious for so-called \"booze tourism\". \"There won't be that kind of mass tourism because those places are not going to open; it's a clear message,\" says Iago Negueruela, the Balearic minister for the economy, labour and tourism. \"We had already started a process and it is irreversible. The pubs won't open this year. We are no longer going to receive or tolerate that kind of tourist, who can be a risk for themselves and others.\" Mr Negueruela highlights the law against \"tourism of excesses\" that his government introduced at the start of the year, banning pub crawls and happy hours. End of an era for 'booze tourism'? The current situation can only accelerate the end of what he says is a mere remnant of a bygone age, the minister argues. \"Our hotel sector has already staked out its preference for quality and not just numbers, but the perception does not always accompany the reality. Even in Magaluf, a transformation has been taking place, with a focus on five-star hotels, its beaches and gastronomy.\" Industry leaders recognise that Covid-19 may make crowding a taboo for all future visitors. \"Some elements of this crisis might be temporary, like face masks,\" says Andreu Serra, tourism chief for the Mallorca Council island administration. \"But this is also an opportunity to improve our care of tourists, by using technology to control numbers so we know when beaches will be full, and generally boosting hygiene in all hospitality areas.\" Time to turn away from tourism? Not everyone is sighing in relief at the return of tourists to Majorca and the other islands. Local environmentalists criticise the over-dependence on a sector that has transformed the archipelago's landscape, while creating employment that is largely low-paid and seasonal in nature as property prices and even rents skyrocket beyond the means of most employees. For Antoni Pallicer Mateu, a member of publishing collective Tot Incl\u00f2s that aim to inform on tourism's impact on the islands, Balearic citizens and in particular Majorcans have become prisoners to a sector \"that is so vulnerable to instability\" and whose use of resources is such that almost all other needs have to be imported. \"Now it's a pandemic, but in the near future it could be a climate or energy crisis, or simply a crisis in our main markets of Germany and the UK,\" argues Mr Pallicer Mateu. \"Tourism benefits tour operators, agencies, hotel chains, rental companies like Airbnb, and also a Majorcan middle class who own property and companies. But it is benefiting the working class and small businesses less and less. Mass tourism is driving us towards unsustainability and an environmental and even social collapse.\" In the Balearic high season, the population of the islands usually doubles due to tourism, as the one million residents are matched by a million tourists. Little wonder, then, that registered unemployment in May was double the normal amount for that month, at 75,000. \"We have tourism dependency, and we will for another 15 years at least, because no other alternative has been developed,\" says Mr Ferrer, noting that the non-services part of the economy only covers 15% of Balearic GDP. \"It's a moment of political opportunity to criticise tourism right now, but that's what is paying people's wages every month,\" Mr Ferrer continues. \"I doubt many of our waiters and waitresses who have been out of work these past few months would subscribe to this point of view.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the possible future of the tourism industry in the Balearic Islands mentioned in the article.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The article discusses the possible future of the tourism industry in the Balearic Islands in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nBoeing will temporarily halt production of its troubled 737 Max airliner in January, the manufacturer said. Production of the jet had continued despite the model being grounded for nine months after two deadly crashes. More than 300 people died when two 737 Max aircraft crashed in Indonesia and Ethiopia after reported problems with a new feature. Boeing had been hoping to have the planes back in the air by the end of this year. But US regulators made it clear that they would not be certified to return to the skies that quickly. What will Boeing do next? Boeing is one of the largest US exporters. The company said in a statement that it would not lay off workers associated with the 737 Max, but the stoppage is likely to affect suppliers and the wider economy. \"Safely returning the 737 Max to service is our top priority,\" the aircraft manufacturer said. \"We know that the process of approving the 737 Max's return to service, and of determining appropriate training requirements, must be extraordinarily thorough and robust, to ensure that our regulators, customers, and the flying public have confidence in the 737 Max updates.\" What went wrong with the planes? Last week a congressional hearing was told that US aviation regulators were aware, following the first crash in Indonesia in October 2018, that there was a risk of further accidents. The Federal Aviation Authority's analysis suggested there could be more than a dozen more crashes over the lifetime of the aircraft unless changes were made to its design. Despite that, the 737 Max was not grounded until after the second crash in Ethiopia in March 2019. Boeing is redesigning the automated control system thought to have been the primary cause of the crashes. The manufacturer said it had 400 of the 737 Max aircraft in storage and would focus on delivering those to customers. While many airlines around the world have the planes on order, delivery was halted to allow Boeing's engineers to develop software fixes. The situation surrounding the 737 Max is extraordinary. Nine months after the aircraft was grounded worldwide, it is still not clear when it will be certified to fly again. Regulators - criticised for allowing a flawed aircraft to fly in the first place - are now playing hardball. For Boeing, being forced to shut down the production line is deeply embarrassing - and likely to prove costly. But it is a huge business, and it can at least redeploy many of its workers. But if the stoppage goes on for long, suppliers could be badly hit. Boeing sits at the top of a global supply chain, ranging from major businesses to small operators. Here in the UK, for example, the company works across 65 sites, including a factory in Sheffield. But it draws on a network of some 300 suppliers. For smaller firms in particular, losing 737-related work could prove serious - hitting revenues and potentially forcing them to lay off workers as well. What has the reaction been? Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt said the decision to suspend production was unprecedented and likely to have a \"massive impact on Boeing, its suppliers and the airlines\". \"It's really going to create some chaos for the airlines that are involved in this as well as the 600 or so companies that are part of the 737 Max supply chain and Boeing itself.\" The suspension of the 737 Max has already cost Boeing around $9bn (\u00a36.75bn). Boeing shares fell more than 4% on Monday amid speculation production would be suspended. The production freeze is expected to be felt across the plane's global supply chain. Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia described Boeing's options for managing the blow to its suppliers as \"bad and worse\". He said the plane maker could either allow them to take a hit, or pay them to wait for when the 737 Max is finally cleared to fly. US carriers operate the largest 737 Max fleets, though airlines around the world also use it. \"The Chinese carriers would [also] be quite badly affected. They're some of the biggest users of the Max,\" said Shukor Yusof, aviation analyst at Endau Analytics. In fact, China's three largest carriers were among the first to press Boeing for compensation over the grounded planes. Aviation analyst Chris Tarry told the Today programme: \"The last thing any manufacturer wants is to stop the production line and it's going to take time to get it going again when the aircraft takes to the skies. \"If we look at it in terms of the volume of the impact on capacity growth in the industry, it is significant and it will take time to recover the production. Boeing's reputation will take time to recover from this as well.\" How are other businesses affected? Some suppliers, such as fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems, are highly dependent on the jet, with half of its revenue attached to it, according to Mr Aboulafia. So far, the supplier has only said it is \"working closely\" with Boeing to determine what impact the production suspension may have.

Production of the jet had continued despite the model being grounded for nine months after two deadly crashes. More than 300 people died when two 737 Max aircraft crashed in Indonesia and Ethiopia after reported problems with a new feature. Boeing had been hoping to have the planes back in the air by the end of this year. But US regulators made it clear that they would not be certified to return to the skies that quickly. What will Boeing do next? Boeing is one of the largest US exporters. The company said in a statement that it would not lay off workers associated with the 737 Max, but the stoppage is likely to affect suppliers and the wider economy. \"Safely returning the 737 Max to service is our top priority,\" the aircraft manufacturer said. \"We know that the process of approving the 737 Max's return to service, and of determining appropriate training requirements, must be extraordinarily thorough and robust, to ensure that our regulators, customers, and the flying public have confidence in the 737 Max updates.\" What went wrong with the planes? Last week a congressional hearing was told that US aviation regulators were aware, following the first crash in Indonesia in October 2018, that there was a risk of further accidents. The Federal Aviation Authority's analysis suggested there could be more than a dozen more crashes over the lifetime of the aircraft unless changes were made to its design. Despite that, the 737 Max was not grounded until after the second crash in Ethiopia in March 2019. Boeing is redesigning the automated control system thought to have been the primary cause of the crashes. The manufacturer said it had 400 of the 737 Max aircraft in storage and would focus on delivering those to customers. While many airlines around the world have the planes on order, delivery was halted to allow Boeing's engineers to develop software fixes. The situation surrounding the 737 Max is extraordinary. Nine months after the aircraft was grounded worldwide, it is still not clear when it will be certified to fly again. Regulators - criticised for allowing a flawed aircraft to fly in the first place - are now playing hardball. For Boeing, being forced to shut down the production line is deeply embarrassing - and likely to prove costly. But it is a huge business, and it can at least redeploy many of its workers. But if the stoppage goes on for long, suppliers could be badly hit. Boeing sits at the top of a global supply chain, ranging from major businesses to small operators. Here in the UK, for example, the company works across 65 sites, including a factory in Sheffield. But it draws on a network of some 300 suppliers. For smaller firms in particular, losing 737-related work could prove serious - hitting revenues and potentially forcing them to lay off workers as well. What has the reaction been? Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt said the decision to suspend production was unprecedented and likely to have a \"massive impact on Boeing, its suppliers and the airlines\". \"It's really going to create some chaos for the airlines that are involved in this as well as the 600 or so companies that are part of the 737 Max supply chain and Boeing itself.\" The suspension of the 737 Max has already cost Boeing around $9bn (\u00a36.75bn). Boeing shares fell more than 4% on Monday amid speculation production would be suspended. The production freeze is expected to be felt across the plane's global supply chain. Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia described Boeing's options for managing the blow to its suppliers as \"bad and worse\". He said the plane maker could either allow them to take a hit, or pay them to wait for when the 737 Max is finally cleared to fly. US carriers operate the largest 737 Max fleets, though airlines around the world also use it. \"The Chinese carriers would [also] be quite badly affected. They're some of the biggest users of the Max,\" said Shukor Yusof, aviation analyst at Endau Analytics. In fact, China's three largest carriers were among the first to press Boeing for compensation over the grounded planes. Aviation analyst Chris Tarry told the Today programme: \"The last thing any manufacturer wants is to stop the production line and it's going to take time to get it going again when the aircraft takes to the skies. \"If we look at it in terms of the volume of the impact on capacity growth in the industry, it is significant and it will take time to recover the production. Boeing's reputation will take time to recover from this as well.\" How are other businesses affected? Some suppliers, such as fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems, are highly dependent on the jet, with half of its revenue attached to it, according to Mr Aboulafia. So far, the supplier has only said it is \"working closely\" with Boeing to determine what impact the production suspension may have. The move by Boeing is unlikely to affect passengers as airlines have leased additional aircraft to replace the 737 Max. It's a different story for airlines, who have the added expense of leasing planes and managing their grounded aircraft. In July, Boeing set aside nearly $5bn to compensate those affected.

Last week a congressional hearing was told that US aviation regulators were aware, following the first crash in Indonesia in October 2018, that there was a risk of further accidents. The Federal Aviation Authority's analysis suggested there could be more than a dozen more crashes over the lifetime of the aircraft unless changes were made to its design. Despite that, the 737 Max was not grounded until after the second crash in Ethiopia in March 2019. Boeing is redesigning the automated control system thought to have been the primary cause of the crashes. The manufacturer said it had 400 of the 737 Max aircraft in storage and would focus on delivering those to customers. While many airlines around the world have the planes on order, delivery was halted to allow Boeing's engineers to develop software fixes. The situation surrounding the 737 Max is extraordinary. Nine months after the aircraft was grounded worldwide, it is still not clear when it will be certified to fly again. Regulators - criticised for allowing a flawed aircraft to fly in the first place - are now playing hardball. For Boeing, being forced to shut down the production line is deeply embarrassing - and likely to prove costly. But it is a huge business, and it can at least redeploy many of its workers. But if the stoppage goes on for long, suppliers could be badly hit. Boeing sits at the top of a global supply chain, ranging from major businesses to small operators. Here in the UK, for example, the company works across 65 sites, including a factory in Sheffield. But it draws on a network of some 300 suppliers. For smaller firms in particular, losing 737-related work could prove serious - hitting revenues and potentially forcing them to lay off workers as well. What has the reaction been? Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt said the decision to suspend production was unprecedented and likely to have a \"massive impact on Boeing, its suppliers and the airlines\". \"It's really going to create some chaos for the airlines that are involved in this as well as the 600 or so companies that are part of the 737 Max supply chain and Boeing itself.\" The suspension of the 737 Max has already cost Boeing around $9bn (\u00a36.75bn). Boeing shares fell more than 4% on Monday amid speculation production would be suspended. The production freeze is expected to be felt across the plane's global supply chain. Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia described Boeing's options for managing the blow to its suppliers as \"bad and worse\". He said the plane maker could either allow them to take a hit, or pay them to wait for when the 737 Max is finally cleared to fly. US carriers operate the largest 737 Max fleets, though airlines around the world also use it. \"The Chinese carriers would [also] be quite badly affected. They're some of the biggest users of the Max,\" said Shukor Yusof, aviation analyst at Endau Analytics. In fact, China's three largest carriers were among the first to press Boeing for compensation over the grounded planes. Aviation analyst Chris Tarry told the Today programme: \"The last thing any manufacturer wants is to stop the production line and it's going to take time to get it going again when the aircraft takes to the skies. \"If we look at it in terms of the volume of the impact on capacity growth in the industry, it is significant and it will take time to recover the production. Boeing's reputation will take time to recover from this as well.\" How are other businesses affected? Some suppliers, such as fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems, are highly dependent on the jet, with half of its revenue attached to it, according to Mr Aboulafia. So far, the supplier has only said it is \"working closely\" with Boeing to determine what impact the production suspension may have. The move by Boeing is unlikely to affect passengers as airlines have leased additional aircraft to replace the 737 Max.

Aviation analyst Chris Tarry told the Today programme: \"The last thing any manufacturer wants is to stop the production line and it's going to take time to get it going again when the aircraft takes to the skies. \"If we look at it in terms of the volume of the impact on capacity growth in the industry, it is significant and it will take time to recover the production. Boeing's reputation will take time to recover from this as well.\" How are other businesses affected? Some suppliers, such as fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems, are highly dependent on the jet, with half of its revenue attached to it, according to Mr Aboulafia. So far, the supplier has only said it is \"working closely\" with Boeing to determine what impact the production suspension may have. The move by Boeing is unlikely to affect passengers as airlines have leased additional aircraft to replace the 737 Max. It's a different story for airlines, who have the added expense of leasing planes and managing their grounded aircraft. In July, Boeing set aside nearly $5bn to compensate those affected. However, that figure assumed that the 737 Max would fly again this year.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nWhat implications has the halted production of 737 max had on its suppliers?\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The halted production of Boeing's 737 Max airliner is expected to have significant implications for its suppliers. The suspension has already cost Boeing around $9bn, and the production freeze is likely to be felt across the plane's global supply chain, affecting over 600 companies. Smaller firms, in particular, could face serious consequences, such as loss of revenue and potential layoffs. Some suppliers, like fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems, are highly dependent on the jet, with half of its revenue attached to it.

But the mountain air does not entice her. By John LaurensonBBC News, Sallanches, France \"The air stinks outside, so you think twice about going out,\" she says. She has had bronchitis, asthma and ear infections on and off since the end of November, when the fine particle pollution started peaking at red alert levels. \"Before you leave the house you ask yourself whether the air's going to make you cough or make your eyes stream or you have to spit,\" says Ms Jouvenceau, 24. \"I leave earlier now when I go to work, so that I can walk slowly and of course I've stopped cycling or doing any sport.\" It's like this every year in the 105km-long (65-mile) Arve Valley, home to 150,000 people and surrounded by some of the world's most famous ski resorts - Megeve, Saint Gervais and Chamonix. Seasonal scourge The pollution from fine (PM10) and ultra-fine (PM2.5) particles - the ones that get right down into your bronchial tubes and do the most damage - is now dangerously high for an average of 40 days a year. In winter, this part of the Alps has the worst fine-particle pollution in France. The problem is compounded by the fact that, at the bottom of these deep mountain valleys, the air is often cooler than higher up. Since it is cooler, the air does not rise or disperse easily. Prof Frank Kelly, chair of environmental health at King's College, London, says the mountains also block the wind, \"rather like the mountains north of Beijing, which stop the dispersal of the wind-borne pollution from the south\". He has been working with the French on a monitoring project in the Arve Valley. At St Joseph's Infant and Primary School, the youngest children are kept inside at break time, while the older ones are allowed into the playground, but are not allowed to run around. \"Since the pollution alert started, the authorities have stopped all school sport,\" says head teacher Nathalie Gex. \"No skating, no swimming pool even. Our gym teacher's been giving theatre classes instead. At break time we give the older children chalk to draw on the ground, and cards and building blocks to play with, to make sure they don't move too much.\" Wood-burning tradition It's a beautiful day and I climb up above Sallanches - by car of course, I'm not going hiking in this air. I was told you can see the pollution from up here. Well, you absolutely can. There is a thick, white quilt of it lying across the town. The other thing you can see from up the mountain is the main cause. Surprisingly, perhaps, it is not the lorries grinding up the valley towards the Mont Blanc Tunnel and Italy. No, the main cause is a renewable energy source with an environmentally-friendly reputation - the humble wood-burning stove. Columns of smoke are rising from many of the houses. \"The latest surveys show that between 60% and 80% of fine-particle pollution here comes from wood-burning stoves and fireplaces in people's homes,\" says Vincent Hazout, who recently organised a demonstration calling for action against air pollution. It rallied 1,000 people in Sallanches. Mr Hazout's six-year-old son is currently ill with asthma. When he was his son's age, he suffered from asthma too. His family lived in Paris but took the decision to leave because of young Vincent's health. They came to Alps for the \"clean mountain air\". \"Now we'll have to move too for my son, like my parents moved for me, unless we can solve this pollution problem,\" Mr Hazout says. Clean-up campaign The power to do something about the air in this valley lies mainly with the representative of central government, called the prefect. His office, though declining an interview, provided details of all the anti-air pollution measures taken this winter - and there are quite a few of them: restrictions on the most-polluting heavy goods vehicles, a voluntary slow-down of some industrial activity, a decrease in volume of refuse-burning and a ban on burning wood for households with alternative means of heating. \"Clearly insufficient,\" says Mr Hazout. \"The authorities don't want to implement more drastic measures, for fear of blackening the image of the ski resorts.\" So how are things up on the pistes? In Chamonix, which attracts thousands of skiers each year, Mayor Eric Fournier says that on the slopes you are fine as you are above the danger zone, and that even in the town the pollution is not nearly as bad as it is down in the valley. He also says air quality is actually improving in Chamonix, because of an upgrade scheme for wood-burning stoves, which he has put in place. But the air quality in Chamonix on winter evenings is still poor. Plenty of wood smoke continues to pump fine particles into the air, despite this scheme. For Vincent Hazout, the way forward is obvious. But it will take political will. Changing the way people heat their homes would have to become far more financially attractive or, if that failed, mandatory. Prof Kelly agrees. \"This pollution has three causes: the topography, the climate and the use of wood as heating fuel. We can't change the first two - although the Chinese have been experimenting with making rain to wash away pollution - but we can act on the wood-burning,\" he says. In January 2015, the authorities in the Paris region banned the use of open fireplaces (more polluting than closed ones), before Ecology Minister Segolene Royal intervened to lift the order.

His family lived in Paris but took the decision to leave because of young Vincent's health. They came to Alps for the \"clean mountain air\". \"Now we'll have to move too for my son, like my parents moved for me, unless we can solve this pollution problem,\" Mr Hazout says. Clean-up campaign The power to do something about the air in this valley lies mainly with the representative of central government, called the prefect. His office, though declining an interview, provided details of all the anti-air pollution measures taken this winter - and there are quite a few of them: restrictions on the most-polluting heavy goods vehicles, a voluntary slow-down of some industrial activity, a decrease in volume of refuse-burning and a ban on burning wood for households with alternative means of heating. \"Clearly insufficient,\" says Mr Hazout. \"The authorities don't want to implement more drastic measures, for fear of blackening the image of the ski resorts.\" So how are things up on the pistes? In Chamonix, which attracts thousands of skiers each year, Mayor Eric Fournier says that on the slopes you are fine as you are above the danger zone, and that even in the town the pollution is not nearly as bad as it is down in the valley. He also says air quality is actually improving in Chamonix, because of an upgrade scheme for wood-burning stoves, which he has put in place. But the air quality in Chamonix on winter evenings is still poor. Plenty of wood smoke continues to pump fine particles into the air, despite this scheme. For Vincent Hazout, the way forward is obvious. But it will take political will. Changing the way people heat their homes would have to become far more financially attractive or, if that failed, mandatory. Prof Kelly agrees. \"This pollution has three causes: the topography, the climate and the use of wood as heating fuel. We can't change the first two - although the Chinese have been experimenting with making rain to wash away pollution - but we can act on the wood-burning,\" he says. In January 2015, the authorities in the Paris region banned the use of open fireplaces (more polluting than closed ones), before Ecology Minister Segolene Royal intervened to lift the order. Many people in the French Alps hope that that measure, or an even more comprehensive ban on wood-heating, will be applied here. \"In two years,\" says Mr Hazout, \"we could have this problem solved\".

By Yojana Sharma\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad But what is behind this success? Eyebrows were raised when the results of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's international maths, science and reading tests - the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests - were published. Shanghai, taking part for the first time, came top in all three subjects. Meanwhile, Hong Kong which was performing well in the last decade of British rule, has gone from good to great. In this global ranking, it came fourth in reading, second in maths and third in science. These two Chinese cities - there was no national ranking for China - had outstripped leading education systems around the world. The results for Beijing, not yet released, are not quite as spectacular. \"But they are still high,\" says Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's head of education statistics and indicators. Cheng Kai-Ming, Professor of Education at Hong Kong University, and closely involved in the Hong Kong and Shanghai tests, puts the results down to \"a devotion to education not shared by some other cultures\". Competitive exams More than 80% of Shanghai's older secondary students attend after-school tutoring. They may spend another three to four hours each day on homework under close parental supervision. Such diligence also reflects the ferociously competitive university entrance examinations. \"Not all Chinese parents are 'tiger mothers',\" insists Prof Cheng. \"But certainly they are devoted to their children's education.\" Certainly both these open and outward-looking cities set great store by education, willing to adopt the best educational practices from around the world to ensure success. In Hong Kong, education accounts for more than one-fifth of entire government spending every year. \"Shanghai and Hong Kong are small education systems, virtually city states, with a concentration of ideas, manpower and resources for education,\" says Prof Cheng. The innovation in these cities is not shared by other parts of China - not even Beijing, he says. Under the banner \"First class city, first class education\", Shanghai set about systematically re-equipping classrooms, upgrading schools and revamping the curriculum in the last decade. It got rid of the \"key schools\" system which concentrated resources only on top students and elite schools. Instead staff were trained in more interactive teaching methods and computers were brought in. Showcase schools The city's schools are now a showcase for the country. About 80% of Shanghai school leavers go to university compared to an overall average of 24% in China. Meanwhile, dynamic Hong Kong was forced into educational improvements as its industries moved to cheaper mainland Chinese areas in the 1990s. Its survival as a service and management hub for China depended on upgrading knowledge and skills. In the last decade Hong Kong has concentrated on raising the bar and closing the gap or \"lifting the floor\" for all students, says a report by McKinsey management consultants. The report, How the World's Most Improved School Systems Keep Getting Better, rated Hong Kong's education system among the best in the world. But Hong Kong schools are undergoing another huge reform, lopping off the final year of secondary school and instead moving towards four-year university degrees from 2012 to align it with China. Abandoning the old British model is a gamble and no-one knows how it will play out in terms of quality. Top teachers However, Hong Kong believes it has laid solid, unshakeable foundations. \"In the late 1990s we moved to all-graduate [teachers]. If we want to have high achievement, subject expertise is very important for secondary schools,\" said Catherine KK Chan, deputy secretary for education in the Hong Kong government. Hong Kong, like Singapore, now recruits teachers from the top 30% of the graduate cohort. By contrast, according to the OECD, the US recruits from the bottom third. Shanghai recruits teachers more broadly. But it is already a select group. Shanghai controls who lives and works in the city through China's notorious \"houkou\" or permanent residency system, allowing only the best and the brightest to become residents with access to jobs and schools. \"For over 50 years Shanghai has been accumulating talent, the cream of the cream in China. That gives it an incredible advantage,\" says Ruth Heyhoe, former head of the Hong Kong Institute of Education, now at the University of Toronto. Migrant children The OECD's Mr Schleicher believes teacher training has played a part in Shanghai's success, with higher-performing teachers mentoring teachers from lower-performing schools, to raise standards across the board. \"What is striking about Shanghai is that there is quite a large socio-economic variability in the student population, but it does not play out in terms of its Pisa results,\" said Mr Schleicher. \"Some people have even suggested we did not include Shanghai's fairly large immigration population. Around 5.1% of the population are migrants from rural areas. Their children are definitely included,\" he said. Last year Shanghai claimed to be the first Chinese city to provide free schooling for all migrant children. This year migrants outnumbered Shanghai-born children for the first time in state primary schools, making up 54% of the intake. Prof Cheng agrees the Pisa results reflect a broad cross section. However the majority of migrant children are below 15 - the age at which the tests for international comparisons are taken. It is also the age of transfer to senior secondaries. \"If they were allowed to attend senior secondary schools in the city, the results would be very different,\" said Prof Cheng. Even now \"to some extent, where people are born largely determines their chances of educational success\", said Gu Jun, a professor of sociology at Shanghai university. Their societies are changing rapidly and for both Shanghai and Hong Kong, being top might prove to be easier than staying there.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize why Shanghai and Hong Kong seem to outperform Beijing in education.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:\n\n# Output (a):\nShanghai and Hong Kong seem to outperform Beijing in education for a variety of reasons. Firstly, both cities have a strong focus on education and are willing to adopt the best practices from around the world. Secondly, both cities have a large pool of talented teachers to choose from. Finally, both cities have a large number of migrant children who are attending state schools.\n\n# Output (b):\nShanghai and Hong Kong seem to outperform Beijing in education due to their devotion to education, willingness to adopt the best educational practices from around the world, and their focus on upgrading knowledge and skills. Shanghai and Hong Kong have also invested heavily in education, re-equipping classrooms, upgrading schools, revamping the curriculum, and recruiting teachers from the top 30% of the graduate cohort. Additionally, Shanghai has an advantage due to its \"houkou\" system, which allows only the best and the brightest to become residents with access to jobs and schools.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nOutput (a) is better.\n\nExplanation:\nOutput (a) provides a more comprehensive summary of the reasons behind Shanghai and Hong Kong's educational success compared to Output (b). Output (a) covers the devotion to education, the adoption of best practices, the recruitment of talented teachers, and the presence of migrant children in state schools. Output (b), on the other hand, focuses mainly on the devotion to education and the recruitment of talented teachers. Therefore, Output (a) is better as it provides a more comprehensive and accurate summary of the reasons behind Shanghai and Hong Kong's educational success.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\nOutput (b) provides a more detailed explanation of the reasons behind Shanghai and Hong Kong's educational success compared to Output (a). It highlights the cities' devotion to education, their willingness to adopt the best practices from around the world, and their focus on upgrading knowledge and skills. Additionally, Output (b) mentions the importance of recruiting top teachers and Shanghai's \"houkou\" system, which gives it an advantage. Output (a) is more general and does not provide as much detail as Output (b).\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

By Yojana Sharma\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad But what is behind this success? Eyebrows were raised when the results of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's international maths, science and reading tests - the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests - were published. Shanghai, taking part for the first time, came top in all three subjects. Meanwhile, Hong Kong which was performing well in the last decade of British rule, has gone from good to great. In this global ranking, it came fourth in reading, second in maths and third in science. These two Chinese cities - there was no national ranking for China - had outstripped leading education systems around the world. The results for Beijing, not yet released, are not quite as spectacular. \"But they are still high,\" says Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's head of education statistics and indicators. Cheng Kai-Ming, Professor of Education at Hong Kong University, and closely involved in the Hong Kong and Shanghai tests, puts the results down to \"a devotion to education not shared by some other cultures\". Competitive exams More than 80% of Shanghai's older secondary students attend after-school tutoring. They may spend another three to four hours each day on homework under close parental supervision. Such diligence also reflects the ferociously competitive university entrance examinations. \"Not all Chinese parents are 'tiger mothers',\" insists Prof Cheng. \"But certainly they are devoted to their children's education.\" Certainly both these open and outward-looking cities set great store by education, willing to adopt the best educational practices from around the world to ensure success. In Hong Kong, education accounts for more than one-fifth of entire government spending every year. \"Shanghai and Hong Kong are small education systems, virtually city states, with a concentration of ideas, manpower and resources for education,\" says Prof Cheng. The innovation in these cities is not shared by other parts of China - not even Beijing, he says. Under the banner \"First class city, first class education\", Shanghai set about systematically re-equipping classrooms, upgrading schools and revamping the curriculum in the last decade. It got rid of the \"key schools\" system which concentrated resources only on top students and elite schools. Instead staff were trained in more interactive teaching methods and computers were brought in. Showcase schools The city's schools are now a showcase for the country. About 80% of Shanghai school leavers go to university compared to an overall average of 24% in China. Meanwhile, dynamic Hong Kong was forced into educational improvements as its industries moved to cheaper mainland Chinese areas in the 1990s. Its survival as a service and management hub for China depended on upgrading knowledge and skills. In the last decade Hong Kong has concentrated on raising the bar and closing the gap or \"lifting the floor\" for all students, says a report by McKinsey management consultants. The report, How the World's Most Improved School Systems Keep Getting Better, rated Hong Kong's education system among the best in the world. But Hong Kong schools are undergoing another huge reform, lopping off the final year of secondary school and instead moving towards four-year university degrees from 2012 to align it with China. Abandoning the old British model is a gamble and no-one knows how it will play out in terms of quality. Top teachers However, Hong Kong believes it has laid solid, unshakeable foundations. \"In the late 1990s we moved to all-graduate [teachers]. If we want to have high achievement, subject expertise is very important for secondary schools,\" said Catherine KK Chan, deputy secretary for education in the Hong Kong government. Hong Kong, like Singapore, now recruits teachers from the top 30% of the graduate cohort. By contrast, according to the OECD, the US recruits from the bottom third. Shanghai recruits teachers more broadly. But it is already a select group. Shanghai controls who lives and works in the city through China's notorious \"houkou\" or permanent residency system, allowing only the best and the brightest to become residents with access to jobs and schools. \"For over 50 years Shanghai has been accumulating talent, the cream of the cream in China. That gives it an incredible advantage,\" says Ruth Heyhoe, former head of the Hong Kong Institute of Education, now at the University of Toronto. Migrant children The OECD's Mr Schleicher believes teacher training has played a part in Shanghai's success, with higher-performing teachers mentoring teachers from lower-performing schools, to raise standards across the board. \"What is striking about Shanghai is that there is quite a large socio-economic variability in the student population, but it does not play out in terms of its Pisa results,\" said Mr Schleicher. \"Some people have even suggested we did not include Shanghai's fairly large immigration population. Around 5.1% of the population are migrants from rural areas. Their children are definitely included,\" he said. Last year Shanghai claimed to be the first Chinese city to provide free schooling for all migrant children. This year migrants outnumbered Shanghai-born children for the first time in state primary schools, making up 54% of the intake. Prof Cheng agrees the Pisa results reflect a broad cross section.

It is also the age of transfer to senior secondaries. \"If they were allowed to attend senior secondary schools in the city, the results would be very different,\" said Prof Cheng.

By Yojana Sharma\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad But what is behind this success? Eyebrows were raised when the results of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's international maths, science and reading tests - the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests - were published. Shanghai, taking part for the first time, came top in all three subjects. Meanwhile, Hong Kong which was performing well in the last decade of British rule, has gone from good to great. In this global ranking, it came fourth in reading, second in maths and third in science. These two Chinese cities - there was no national ranking for China - had outstripped leading education systems around the world. The results for Beijing, not yet released, are not quite as spectacular. \"But they are still high,\" says Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's head of education statistics and indicators. Cheng Kai-Ming, Professor of Education at Hong Kong University, and closely involved in the Hong Kong and Shanghai tests, puts the results down to \"a devotion to education not shared by some other cultures\". Competitive exams More than 80% of Shanghai's older secondary students attend after-school tutoring. They may spend another three to four hours each day on homework under close parental supervision. Such diligence also reflects the ferociously competitive university entrance examinations. \"Not all Chinese parents are 'tiger mothers',\" insists Prof Cheng. \"But certainly they are devoted to their children's education.\" Certainly both these open and outward-looking cities set great store by education, willing to adopt the best educational practices from around the world to ensure success. In Hong Kong, education accounts for more than one-fifth of entire government spending every year. \"Shanghai and Hong Kong are small education systems, virtually city states, with a concentration of ideas, manpower and resources for education,\" says Prof Cheng. The innovation in these cities is not shared by other parts of China - not even Beijing, he says. Under the banner \"First class city, first class education\", Shanghai set about systematically re-equipping classrooms, upgrading schools and revamping the curriculum in the last decade. It got rid of the \"key schools\" system which concentrated resources only on top students and elite schools. Instead staff were trained in more interactive teaching methods and computers were brought in. Showcase schools The city's schools are now a showcase for the country. About 80% of Shanghai school leavers go to university compared to an overall average of 24% in China. Meanwhile, dynamic Hong Kong was forced into educational improvements as its industries moved to cheaper mainland Chinese areas in the 1990s. Its survival as a service and management hub for China depended on upgrading knowledge and skills. In the last decade Hong Kong has concentrated on raising the bar and closing the gap or \"lifting the floor\" for all students, says a report by McKinsey management consultants. The report, How the World's Most Improved School Systems Keep Getting Better, rated Hong Kong's education system among the best in the world. But Hong Kong schools are undergoing another huge reform, lopping off the final year of secondary school and instead moving towards four-year university degrees from 2012 to align it with China. Abandoning the old British model is a gamble and no-one knows how it will play out in terms of quality. Top teachers However, Hong Kong believes it has laid solid, unshakeable foundations. \"In the late 1990s we moved to all-graduate [teachers]. If we want to have high achievement, subject expertise is very important for secondary schools,\" said Catherine KK Chan, deputy secretary for education in the Hong Kong government. Hong Kong, like Singapore, now recruits teachers from the top 30% of the graduate cohort. By contrast, according to the OECD, the US recruits from the bottom third. Shanghai recruits teachers more broadly. But it is already a select group. Shanghai controls who lives and works in the city through China's notorious \"houkou\" or permanent residency system, allowing only the best and the brightest to become residents with access to jobs and schools. \"For over 50 years Shanghai has been accumulating talent, the cream of the cream in China. That gives it an incredible advantage,\" says Ruth Heyhoe, former head of the Hong Kong Institute of Education, now at the University of Toronto. Migrant children The OECD's Mr Schleicher believes teacher training has played a part in Shanghai's success, with higher-performing teachers mentoring teachers from lower-performing schools, to raise standards across the board. \"What is striking about Shanghai is that there is quite a large socio-economic variability in the student population, but it does not play out in terms of its Pisa results,\" said Mr Schleicher. \"Some people have even suggested we did not include Shanghai's fairly large immigration population. Around 5.1% of the population are migrants from rural areas. Their children are definitely included,\" he said. Last year Shanghai claimed to be the first Chinese city to provide free schooling for all migrant children. This year migrants outnumbered Shanghai-born children for the first time in state primary schools, making up 54% of the intake. Prof Cheng agrees the Pisa results reflect a broad cross section. However the majority of migrant children are below 15 - the age at which the tests for international comparisons are taken. It is also the age of transfer to senior secondaries. \"If they were allowed to attend senior secondary schools in the city, the results would be very different,\" said Prof Cheng. Even now \"to some extent, where people are born largely determines their chances of educational success\", said Gu Jun, a professor of sociology at Shanghai university.

Migrant children The OECD's Mr Schleicher believes teacher training has played a part in Shanghai's success, with higher-performing teachers mentoring teachers from lower-performing schools, to raise standards across the board. \"What is striking about Shanghai is that there is quite a large socio-economic variability in the student population, but it does not play out in terms of its Pisa results,\" said Mr Schleicher. \"Some people have even suggested we did not include Shanghai's fairly large immigration population. Around 5.1% of the population are migrants from rural areas. Their children are definitely included,\" he said. Last year Shanghai claimed to be the first Chinese city to provide free schooling for all migrant children. This year migrants outnumbered Shanghai-born children for the first time in state primary schools, making up 54% of the intake. Prof Cheng agrees the Pisa results reflect a broad cross section. However the majority of migrant children are below 15 - the age at which the tests for international comparisons are taken. It is also the age of transfer to senior secondaries. \"If they were allowed to attend senior secondary schools in the city, the results would be very different,\" said Prof Cheng.

By Yojana Sharma\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad But what is behind this success? Eyebrows were raised when the results of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's international maths, science and reading tests - the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests - were published. Shanghai, taking part for the first time, came top in all three subjects. Meanwhile, Hong Kong which was performing well in the last decade of British rule, has gone from good to great. In this global ranking, it came fourth in reading, second in maths and third in science. These two Chinese cities - there was no national ranking for China - had outstripped leading education systems around the world. The results for Beijing, not yet released, are not quite as spectacular. \"But they are still high,\" says Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's head of education statistics and indicators. Cheng Kai-Ming, Professor of Education at Hong Kong University, and closely involved in the Hong Kong and Shanghai tests, puts the results down to \"a devotion to education not shared by some other cultures\". Competitive exams More than 80% of Shanghai's older secondary students attend after-school tutoring. They may spend another three to four hours each day on homework under close parental supervision. Such diligence also reflects the ferociously competitive university entrance examinations. \"Not all Chinese parents are 'tiger mothers',\" insists Prof Cheng. \"But certainly they are devoted to their children's education.\" Certainly both these open and outward-looking cities set great store by education, willing to adopt the best educational practices from around the world to ensure success. In Hong Kong, education accounts for more than one-fifth of entire government spending every year. \"Shanghai and Hong Kong are small education systems, virtually city states, with a concentration of ideas, manpower and resources for education,\" says Prof Cheng. The innovation in these cities is not shared by other parts of China - not even Beijing, he says. Under the banner \"First class city, first class education\", Shanghai set about systematically re-equipping classrooms, upgrading schools and revamping the curriculum in the last decade. It got rid of the \"key schools\" system which concentrated resources only on top students and elite schools. Instead staff were trained in more interactive teaching methods and computers were brought in. Showcase schools The city's schools are now a showcase for the country. About 80% of Shanghai school leavers go to university compared to an overall average of 24% in China. Meanwhile, dynamic Hong Kong was forced into educational improvements as its industries moved to cheaper mainland Chinese areas in the 1990s. Its survival as a service and management hub for China depended on upgrading knowledge and skills. In the last decade Hong Kong has concentrated on raising the bar and closing the gap or \"lifting the floor\" for all students, says a report by McKinsey management consultants. The report, How the World's Most Improved School Systems Keep Getting Better, rated Hong Kong's education system among the best in the world. But Hong Kong schools are undergoing another huge reform, lopping off the final year of secondary school and instead moving towards four-year university degrees from 2012 to align it with China. Abandoning the old British model is a gamble and no-one knows how it will play out in terms of quality. Top teachers However, Hong Kong believes it has laid solid, unshakeable foundations. \"In the late 1990s we moved to all-graduate [teachers]. If we want to have high achievement, subject expertise is very important for secondary schools,\" said Catherine KK Chan, deputy secretary for education in the Hong Kong government. Hong Kong, like Singapore, now recruits teachers from the top 30% of the graduate cohort. By contrast, according to the OECD, the US recruits from the bottom third.

Firstly, both cities place a great deal of importance on education, and are willing to adopt the best educational practices from around the world. Secondly, both cities have very competitive university entrance examinations, which drives students to excel. Finally, both cities have strong teacher training programs, which ensure that all students have access to high-quality instruction.\n\n# Output (b):\nShanghai and Hong Kong have achieved spectacular education performance due to their devotion to education, competitive exams, willingness to adopt the best educational practices from around the world, and their investment in education. Shanghai has systematically re-equipped classrooms, upgraded schools, and revamped the curriculum, while Hong Kong has concentrated on raising the bar and closing the gap for all students. Both cities also recruit teachers from the top 30% of the graduate cohort, and Shanghai controls who lives and works in the city through the permanent residency system.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nOutput (a) is better.\n\nExplanation:\nOutput (a) provides a more comprehensive summary of the reasons behind Shanghai and Hong Kong's spectacular education performance. It covers the devotion to education, competitive exams, willingness to adopt the best educational practices, investment in education, teacher training programs, and the impact of the permanent residency system. Output (b) focuses more on the importance of education, competitive exams, and teacher training programs, but does not mention the other factors that contribute to their success. Therefore, Output (a) is better for summarizing the reasons behind Shanghai and Hong Kong's education performance.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nAfter evaluating the two outputs, I find that both Output (a) and Output (b) are equally informative and execute the instruction well.

By Yojana Sharma\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad But what is behind this success? Eyebrows were raised when the results of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's international maths, science and reading tests - the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests - were published. Shanghai, taking part for the first time, came top in all three subjects. Meanwhile, Hong Kong which was performing well in the last decade of British rule, has gone from good to great. In this global ranking, it came fourth in reading, second in maths and third in science. These two Chinese cities - there was no national ranking for China - had outstripped leading education systems around the world. The results for Beijing, not yet released, are not quite as spectacular. \"But they are still high,\" says Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's head of education statistics and indicators. Cheng Kai-Ming, Professor of Education at Hong Kong University, and closely involved in the Hong Kong and Shanghai tests, puts the results down to \"a devotion to education not shared by some other cultures\". Competitive exams More than 80% of Shanghai's older secondary students attend after-school tutoring. They may spend another three to four hours each day on homework under close parental supervision. Such diligence also reflects the ferociously competitive university entrance examinations. \"Not all Chinese parents are 'tiger mothers',\" insists Prof Cheng. \"But certainly they are devoted to their children's education.\" Certainly both these open and outward-looking cities set great store by education, willing to adopt the best educational practices from around the world to ensure success. In Hong Kong, education accounts for more than one-fifth of entire government spending every year. \"Shanghai and Hong Kong are small education systems, virtually city states, with a concentration of ideas, manpower and resources for education,\" says Prof Cheng. The innovation in these cities is not shared by other parts of China - not even Beijing, he says. Under the banner \"First class city, first class education\", Shanghai set about systematically re-equipping classrooms, upgrading schools and revamping the curriculum in the last decade. It got rid of the \"key schools\" system which concentrated resources only on top students and elite schools. Instead staff were trained in more interactive teaching methods and computers were brought in. Showcase schools The city's schools are now a showcase for the country. About 80% of Shanghai school leavers go to university compared to an overall average of 24% in China. Meanwhile, dynamic Hong Kong was forced into educational improvements as its industries moved to cheaper mainland Chinese areas in the 1990s. Its survival as a service and management hub for China depended on upgrading knowledge and skills. In the last decade Hong Kong has concentrated on raising the bar and closing the gap or \"lifting the floor\" for all students, says a report by McKinsey management consultants. The report, How the World's Most Improved School Systems Keep Getting Better, rated Hong Kong's education system among the best in the world. But Hong Kong schools are undergoing another huge reform, lopping off the final year of secondary school and instead moving towards four-year university degrees from 2012 to align it with China. Abandoning the old British model is a gamble and no-one knows how it will play out in terms of quality. Top teachers However, Hong Kong believes it has laid solid, unshakeable foundations. \"In the late 1990s we moved to all-graduate [teachers]. If we want to have high achievement, subject expertise is very important for secondary schools,\" said Catherine KK Chan, deputy secretary for education in the Hong Kong government. Hong Kong, like Singapore, now recruits teachers from the top 30% of the graduate cohort. By contrast, according to the OECD, the US recruits from the bottom third. Shanghai recruits teachers more broadly. But it is already a select group. Shanghai controls who lives and works in the city through China's notorious \"houkou\" or permanent residency system, allowing only the best and the brightest to become residents with access to jobs and schools. \"For over 50 years Shanghai has been accumulating talent, the cream of the cream in China. That gives it an incredible advantage,\" says Ruth Heyhoe, former head of the Hong Kong Institute of Education, now at the University of Toronto. Migrant children The OECD's Mr Schleicher believes teacher training has played a part in Shanghai's success, with higher-performing teachers mentoring teachers from lower-performing schools, to raise standards across the board. \"What is striking about Shanghai is that there is quite a large socio-economic variability in the student population, but it does not play out in terms of its Pisa results,\" said Mr Schleicher. \"Some people have even suggested we did not include Shanghai's fairly large immigration population. Around 5.1% of the population are migrants from rural areas. Their children are definitely included,\" he said. Last year Shanghai claimed to be the first Chinese city to provide free schooling for all migrant children. This year migrants outnumbered Shanghai-born children for the first time in state primary schools, making up 54% of the intake. Prof Cheng agrees the Pisa results reflect a broad cross section. However the majority of migrant children are below 15 - the age at which the tests for international comparisons are taken. It is also the age of transfer to senior secondaries. \"If they were allowed to attend senior secondary schools in the city, the results would be very different,\" said Prof Cheng. Even now \"to some extent, where people are born largely determines their chances of educational success\", said Gu Jun, a professor of sociology at Shanghai university.

By Yojana Sharma\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad But what is behind this success? Eyebrows were raised when the results of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's international maths, science and reading tests - the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests - were published. Shanghai, taking part for the first time, came top in all three subjects. Meanwhile, Hong Kong which was performing well in the last decade of British rule, has gone from good to great. In this global ranking, it came fourth in reading, second in maths and third in science. These two Chinese cities - there was no national ranking for China - had outstripped leading education systems around the world. The results for Beijing, not yet released, are not quite as spectacular. \"But they are still high,\" says Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's head of education statistics and indicators. Cheng Kai-Ming, Professor of Education at Hong Kong University, and closely involved in the Hong Kong and Shanghai tests, puts the results down to \"a devotion to education not shared by some other cultures\". Competitive exams More than 80% of Shanghai's older secondary students attend after-school tutoring. They may spend another three to four hours each day on homework under close parental supervision. Such diligence also reflects the ferociously competitive university entrance examinations. \"Not all Chinese parents are 'tiger mothers',\" insists Prof Cheng. \"But certainly they are devoted to their children's education.\" Certainly both these open and outward-looking cities set great store by education, willing to adopt the best educational practices from around the world to ensure success. In Hong Kong, education accounts for more than one-fifth of entire government spending every year. \"Shanghai and Hong Kong are small education systems, virtually city states, with a concentration of ideas, manpower and resources for education,\" says Prof Cheng. The innovation in these cities is not shared by other parts of China - not even Beijing, he says. Under the banner \"First class city, first class education\", Shanghai set about systematically re-equipping classrooms, upgrading schools and revamping the curriculum in the last decade. It got rid of the \"key schools\" system which concentrated resources only on top students and elite schools. Instead staff were trained in more interactive teaching methods and computers were brought in. Showcase schools The city's schools are now a showcase for the country. About 80% of Shanghai school leavers go to university compared to an overall average of 24% in China. Meanwhile, dynamic Hong Kong was forced into educational improvements as its industries moved to cheaper mainland Chinese areas in the 1990s. Its survival as a service and management hub for China depended on upgrading knowledge and skills. In the last decade Hong Kong has concentrated on raising the bar and closing the gap or \"lifting the floor\" for all students, says a report by McKinsey management consultants. The report, How the World's Most Improved School Systems Keep Getting Better, rated Hong Kong's education system among the best in the world. But Hong Kong schools are undergoing another huge reform, lopping off the final year of secondary school and instead moving towards four-year university degrees from 2012 to align it with China. Abandoning the old British model is a gamble and no-one knows how it will play out in terms of quality. Top teachers However, Hong Kong believes it has laid solid, unshakeable foundations. \"In the late 1990s we moved to all-graduate [teachers]. If we want to have high achievement, subject expertise is very important for secondary schools,\" said Catherine KK Chan, deputy secretary for education in the Hong Kong government. Hong Kong, like Singapore, now recruits teachers from the top 30% of the graduate cohort. By contrast, according to the OECD, the US recruits from the bottom third. Shanghai recruits teachers more broadly. But it is already a select group. Shanghai controls who lives and works in the city through China's notorious \"houkou\" or permanent residency system, allowing only the best and the brightest to become residents with access to jobs and schools. \"For over 50 years Shanghai has been accumulating talent, the cream of the cream in China. That gives it an incredible advantage,\" says Ruth Heyhoe, former head of the Hong Kong Institute of Education, now at the University of Toronto. Migrant children The OECD's Mr Schleicher believes teacher training has played a part in Shanghai's success, with higher-performing teachers mentoring teachers from lower-performing schools, to raise standards across the board. \"What is striking about Shanghai is that there is quite a large socio-economic variability in the student population, but it does not play out in terms of its Pisa results,\" said Mr Schleicher. \"Some people have even suggested we did not include Shanghai's fairly large immigration population. Around 5.1% of the population are migrants from rural areas. Their children are definitely included,\" he said. Last year Shanghai claimed to be the first Chinese city to provide free schooling for all migrant children. This year migrants outnumbered Shanghai-born children for the first time in state primary schools, making up 54% of the intake. Prof Cheng agrees the Pisa results reflect a broad cross section. However the majority of migrant children are below 15 - the age at which the tests for international comparisons are taken. It is also the age of transfer to senior secondaries. \"If they were allowed to attend senior secondary schools in the city, the results would be very different,\" said Prof Cheng.

Hong Kong, like Singapore, now recruits teachers from the top 30% of the graduate cohort. By contrast, according to the OECD, the US recruits from the bottom third. Shanghai recruits teachers more broadly. But it is already a select group. Shanghai controls who lives and works in the city through China's notorious \"houkou\" or permanent residency system, allowing only the best and the brightest to become residents with access to jobs and schools. \"For over 50 years Shanghai has been accumulating talent, the cream of the cream in China. That gives it an incredible advantage,\" says Ruth Heyhoe, former head of the Hong Kong Institute of Education, now at the University of Toronto. Migrant children The OECD's Mr Schleicher believes teacher training has played a part in Shanghai's success, with higher-performing teachers mentoring teachers from lower-performing schools, to raise standards across the board. \"What is striking about Shanghai is that there is quite a large socio-economic variability in the student population, but it does not play out in terms of its Pisa results,\" said Mr Schleicher. \"Some people have even suggested we did not include Shanghai's fairly large immigration population. Around 5.1% of the population are migrants from rural areas. Their children are definitely included,\" he said. Last year Shanghai claimed to be the first Chinese city to provide free schooling for all migrant children. This year migrants outnumbered Shanghai-born children for the first time in state primary schools, making up 54% of the intake. Prof Cheng agrees the Pisa results reflect a broad cross section. However the majority of migrant children are below 15 - the age at which the tests for international comparisons are taken. It is also the age of transfer to senior secondaries. \"If they were allowed to attend senior secondary schools in the city, the results would be very different,\" said Prof Cheng. Even now \"to some extent, where people are born largely determines their chances of educational success\", said Gu Jun, a professor of sociology at Shanghai university. Their societies are changing rapidly and for both Shanghai and Hong Kong, being top might prove to be easier than staying there.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the reasons why Shanghai and Hong Kong seem to have spectacular education performance.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "Shanghai and Hong Kong have achieved spectacular education performance, outperforming many advanced countries, due to their devotion to education, willingness to adopt the best educational practices from around the world, and concentration of ideas, manpower, and resources for education.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nHealth warnings have been issued for parts of England, as air pollution reaches high levels. So what exactly is the problem, and how serious is it? How bad is the pollution in the UK? By UK standards, air pollution levels are high. The Department of the Environment measures outdoor air pollution on a one-to-10 scale. Parts of north-west Norfolk hit level 10 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, levels were recorded at seven - meaning high - in towns and cities in East Anglia and rural parts of south-east England. Pollution levels of five were reached in London, the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside. What has caused it? The tipping point seems to have been dust from storms in the Sahara. Normally it settles in the countries of southern Europe - Spain, Malta and Greece, for example. However, winds from the south and east have brought the dust to the UK, along with industrial pollution from Europe. And because those weather conditions are stable and not changing, those particles are not being dispersed. But that is only part of the problem. Most air pollution in the UK comes from road transport and residential emissions. What is being measured? Leaving aside the Sahara dust, the pollution is made up of various substances, including nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ammonia. These form particles in the atmosphere. The two most common measurements are particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometres or less, known as PM2.5; and larger particles measuring 10 micrometres, known as PM10. The World Health Organization (WHO) uses PM10 levels to measure pollution, expressed in micrograms per cubic metre. It recommends mean exposure over 24 hours to PM2.5 of no more than 10 micrograms/m3, and to PM10 of no more than 25. PM2.5 particles are thought to be particularly damaging because they are so small, they can penetrate into the deepest parts of the lungs. WHO air quality guidelines Why is the UK doing so badly? Last month, the EU announced it was taking legal action against the UK because it was persistently over the safe limit for air pollution - in particular, levels of nitrogen dioxide. But the UK is not alone - most EU countries struggle to meet the targets, says Martin Adams of the European Environment Agency. In fact, the EU is currently taking action against 17 out of 28 member states with serious air quality problems. EU standards make allowances for natural sources of air pollution, including Saharan dust for Spain and ozone for coastal countries such as the UK. Frank Kelly, professor of Environmental Health at King's College London, puts the blame for the UK's pollution woes squarely on the shift to diesel vehicles over the past 10 years. Six out of 10 cars sold today in the UK are diesels, and these produce a lot of nitrogen dioxide, he says. King's College London air quality monitoring project (London only) How serious a problem is air pollution generally? In all, the WHO says air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths a year around the world. That includes indoor as well as outdoor pollution - typically, smoke from cooking stoves in developing countries. About 80% of deaths related to outdoor pollution are linked to heart disease and strokes, while 14% are due to lung or respiratory diseases, and 6% to cancer, estimates the WHO. But even at times of lower pollution, UK air quality still routinely breaches WHO recommended limits. Even when the air looks clean, it is not. WHO: Air pollution 'killed seven million' According to Joe Hennon, the European Commission's spokesman on pollution, around 30,000 people in the UK die prematurely every year from problems associated with air pollution. He describes it as an \"invisible killer\". \"Air pollution can be carcinogenic,\" he said. \"It also causes all kinds of respiratory problems, heart disease, [and] lung problems\". Some headlines have said the UK's air quality is worse than China - is that true? No, says Professor Kelly. When it comes to bad air quality, Beijing has few rivals. In February, at the height of a severe smog episode, the BBC's Jo Floto, in Beijing, wrote that the air quality in the city was \"so bad it's comparable to living near a forest fire\". The Chinese government has recently begun publishing air quality figures for the major cities, although the accuracy of these is sometimes contested. The US embassy in Beijing runs an air quality monitor and releases updates several times daily. At 21:00 (13:00 GMT) on Wednesday, it measured PM2.5 levels of 87 - more than eight times the WHO 24-hour limit. In February, levels soared to 15 times the WHO limit. Compare that with the UK - in the hour to 16:00 on Wednesday, the highest PM2.5 level recorded by the Department for the Environment was 57, in Rochester, Kent. UK air quality levels (Department for the Environment) What might help cut the air pollution? A change in the weather forecast for the end of the week is expected to bring some relief. When pollution measures soared last month, Paris imposed restrictions, banning cars with even-numbered plates from driving on one day, followed by a ban on odd-numbered plates the following day. The EU Environment Agency is awaiting data on whether the ban had much effect. In any case, London will not be following suit. Mr Hennon says the UK can learn from cities like Amsterdam, where there are traffic restrictions - including speed restrictions on motorways - as well as good public transport links and cycle lanes. But he warns there is no easy answer and a range of measures are needed to tackle the problem. A shift towards less polluting forms of transport will be necessary, believes Prof Kelly. In 10 years' time, diesel vehicles will have been largely replaced by low-emission vehicles.

The World Health Organization (WHO) uses PM10 levels to measure pollution, expressed in micrograms per cubic metre. It recommends mean exposure over 24 hours to PM2.5 of no more than 10 micrograms/m3, and to PM10 of no more than 25. PM2.5 particles are thought to be particularly damaging because they are so small, they can penetrate into the deepest parts of the lungs. WHO air quality guidelines Why is the UK doing so badly? Last month, the EU announced it was taking legal action against the UK because it was persistently over the safe limit for air pollution - in particular, levels of nitrogen dioxide. But the UK is not alone - most EU countries struggle to meet the targets, says Martin Adams of the European Environment Agency. In fact, the EU is currently taking action against 17 out of 28 member states with serious air quality problems. EU standards make allowances for natural sources of air pollution, including Saharan dust for Spain and ozone for coastal countries such as the UK. Frank Kelly, professor of Environmental Health at King's College London, puts the blame for the UK's pollution woes squarely on the shift to diesel vehicles over the past 10 years. Six out of 10 cars sold today in the UK are diesels, and these produce a lot of nitrogen dioxide, he says. King's College London air quality monitoring project (London only) How serious a problem is air pollution generally? In all, the WHO says air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths a year around the world. That includes indoor as well as outdoor pollution - typically, smoke from cooking stoves in developing countries. About 80% of deaths related to outdoor pollution are linked to heart disease and strokes, while 14% are due to lung or respiratory diseases, and 6% to cancer, estimates the WHO. But even at times of lower pollution, UK air quality still routinely breaches WHO recommended limits. Even when the air looks clean, it is not. WHO: Air pollution 'killed seven million' According to Joe Hennon, the European Commission's spokesman on pollution, around 30,000 people in the UK die prematurely every year from problems associated with air pollution. He describes it as an \"invisible killer\". \"Air pollution can be carcinogenic,\" he said. \"It also causes all kinds of respiratory problems, heart disease, [and] lung problems\". Some headlines have said the UK's air quality is worse than China - is that true? No, says Professor Kelly. When it comes to bad air quality, Beijing has few rivals. In February, at the height of a severe smog episode, the BBC's Jo Floto, in Beijing, wrote that the air quality in the city was \"so bad it's comparable to living near a forest fire\". The Chinese government has recently begun publishing air quality figures for the major cities, although the accuracy of these is sometimes contested. The US embassy in Beijing runs an air quality monitor and releases updates several times daily. At 21:00 (13:00 GMT) on Wednesday, it measured PM2.5 levels of 87 - more than eight times the WHO 24-hour limit. In February, levels soared to 15 times the WHO limit. Compare that with the UK - in the hour to 16:00 on Wednesday, the highest PM2.5 level recorded by the Department for the Environment was 57, in Rochester, Kent. UK air quality levels (Department for the Environment) What might help cut the air pollution? A change in the weather forecast for the end of the week is expected to bring some relief. When pollution measures soared last month, Paris imposed restrictions, banning cars with even-numbered plates from driving on one day, followed by a ban on odd-numbered plates the following day. The EU Environment Agency is awaiting data on whether the ban had much effect. In any case, London will not be following suit. Mr Hennon says the UK can learn from cities like Amsterdam, where there are traffic restrictions - including speed restrictions on motorways - as well as good public transport links and cycle lanes. But he warns there is no easy answer and a range of measures are needed to tackle the problem. A shift towards less polluting forms of transport will be necessary, believes Prof Kelly. In 10 years' time, diesel vehicles will have been largely replaced by low-emission vehicles.

So what exactly is the problem, and how serious is it? How bad is the pollution in the UK? By UK standards, air pollution levels are high. The Department of the Environment measures outdoor air pollution on a one-to-10 scale. Parts of north-west Norfolk hit level 10 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, levels were recorded at seven - meaning high - in towns and cities in East Anglia and rural parts of south-east England. Pollution levels of five were reached in London, the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside. What has caused it? The tipping point seems to have been dust from storms in the Sahara. Normally it settles in the countries of southern Europe - Spain, Malta and Greece, for example. However, winds from the south and east have brought the dust to the UK, along with industrial pollution from Europe. And because those weather conditions are stable and not changing, those particles are not being dispersed. But that is only part of the problem. Most air pollution in the UK comes from road transport and residential emissions. What is being measured?

It lies just 5km (three miles) north of the sprawling complex that was once the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. By Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Fukushima, Japan You can see the tall white chimneys of the plant peaking over a low hill. I've been to Namie before. Each time I go back is like the first, so arresting is the scene that confronts you. For three years, time here has stood still. An old wooden house brought down by the earthquake still lies in the middle of a road. Through the broken window of a noodle shop I can see used bowls and chopsticks still lying on tables. I look through the windows of an old people's home. Beds lie unmade; laundry hangs from a drier. It's as if the residents have gone off for breakfast and at any moment they'll be shuffling back in. But no one is coming back. When explosions hit the nuclear plant the pall of radiation was blown right across this town. And so Namie remains utterly deserted, its residents scattered far and wide. In their exile they live in constant fear and anxiety. Fear of what the radiation may have done to their children and anxiety that they will never get their old lives back. 'Need to be sure' At a private hospital 60km from the plant I meet Miyuki Arakawa and her two little boys, five-year-old Ryota and three-year-old Haruto. The boys are changing in to hospital pyjamas. They giggle with the nurses. They've done all this before; it's no longer frightening. But it is for their mother. In a narrow room Haruto climbs in to a large blue machine that looks a bit like a bath. The big blue bathtub is the world's first and only infant full-body radiation scanner. Inside Haruto begins to fidget as the data starts to show on a nearby computer screen. \"After the Chernobyl disaster children were diagnosed many years later,\" Miyuki said. \"My boys may be fine now, but if there is any risk I need to find out as soon as possible.\" Her anxiety level has been raised further by the latest government findings. Since 2011 Japan has surveyed 260,000 Fukushima children. So far 33 cases of thyroid cancer have been confirmed; another 42 are suspected. \"The government gives us very little information,\" she said. \"I need to be completely sure my boys are fine. I want this hospital to follow up next year and the following year and the one after that.\" 'Not related' Look up \"Fukushima thyroid cancer\" on the internet and you will find a legion of horror stories, predictions that thousands of Fukushima children will get cancer. It's little wonder parents like Miyuki are scared. But should they be? At Fukushima University Medical School Professor Shinichi Suzuki leads the team studying the children of Fukushima. A cheerful round-faced man with a grey moustache, Prof Suzuki is frustrated by the constant likening of Fukushima to Chernobyl. \"The first thing to understand is that the amount of radiation released from Fukushima was much lower than at Chernobyl,\" he said. \"Second, the number of children in Fukushima who got a radiation dose above 50 millisieverts is very few, maybe as low as zero.\" In other words the highest level of exposure children at Fukushima are thought to have received (50 millisieverts) is at the very lowest end of exposure for children in Chernobyl. In that case how does Professor Suzuki explain the 33 confirmed cases of thyroid cancer his team have found? \"In Japan there has never been a survey on this scale done before,\" he said. \"Once you start using very sensitive equipment to check for thyroid cancer in a very large group of children then you will inevitably find an increase in the number of cases. That is why we are seeing the increase now. These cases are not related to the nuclear disaster.\" Prof Suzuki says his team will need to carry on their work for many more years to be sure that the children of Fukushima are in the clear. But he and other experts now say they think there will be very few, or even zero, extra childhood cancers because of Fukushima. 'Took everything' That does not mean that the Fukushima disaster is not taking lives. According to the government's own figures, in the last three years more than 1,600 Fukushima evacuees have died from causes that are \"related to the disaster\" On a freezing March morning I meet 56-year-old Hideko Takeda at a grave yard a few kilometres from the little town of Namie. She has come to burn incense on her father's grave. The black marble is still shiny and new. She has a photograph of him with her. He was tall for a Japanese farmer and at 80 still robust. Each day he still milked the cows and tended his fields. But then the disaster stuck and he was forced to flee, leaving his cows to starve to death in their shed. It broke him, Mrs Takeda says; his health collapsed, within two years he was dead. \"I blame the power company [Tepco] for his death,\" she said. \"They took everything from him, his dreams, his hope. They took his land and scattered his family far from home. Nothing will ever bring those back.\" There is also growing evidence of an increase in suicides among Fukushima evacuees. Mrs Takeda says she knows of several from the villages around her farm. \"One man I know went back to check his house,\" she said. \"When he didn't return his family went to find him. His car was parked outside. He had hanged himself. I think he'd given up, he couldn't see any future.\" So far no one has died from radiation in Fukushima. But unable to return to their homes, scattered in evacuations centres, perhaps lonely and depressed, a growing number of evacuees are dying from anxiety, from suicide or from simply losing the will to live.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize what Miyuki Arakawa is worried about.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:\n\n# Output (a):\nMiyuki Arakawa is worried about the potential health effects of radiation exposure on her two young sons.

It lies just 5km (three miles) north of the sprawling complex that was once the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. By Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Fukushima, Japan You can see the tall white chimneys of the plant peaking over a low hill. I've been to Namie before. Each time I go back is like the first, so arresting is the scene that confronts you. For three years, time here has stood still. An old wooden house brought down by the earthquake still lies in the middle of a road. Through the broken window of a noodle shop I can see used bowls and chopsticks still lying on tables. I look through the windows of an old people's home. Beds lie unmade; laundry hangs from a drier. It's as if the residents have gone off for breakfast and at any moment they'll be shuffling back in. But no one is coming back. When explosions hit the nuclear plant the pall of radiation was blown right across this town. And so Namie remains utterly deserted, its residents scattered far and wide. In their exile they live in constant fear and anxiety. Fear of what the radiation may have done to their children and anxiety that they will never get their old lives back. 'Need to be sure' At a private hospital 60km from the plant I meet Miyuki Arakawa and her two little boys, five-year-old Ryota and three-year-old Haruto. The boys are changing in to hospital pyjamas. They giggle with the nurses. They've done all this before; it's no longer frightening. But it is for their mother. In a narrow room Haruto climbs in to a large blue machine that looks a bit like a bath. The big blue bathtub is the world's first and only infant full-body radiation scanner. Inside Haruto begins to fidget as the data starts to show on a nearby computer screen. \"After the Chernobyl disaster children were diagnosed many years later,\" Miyuki said. \"My boys may be fine now, but if there is any risk I need to find out as soon as possible.\" Her anxiety level has been raised further by the latest government findings. Since 2011 Japan has surveyed 260,000 Fukushima children. So far 33 cases of thyroid cancer have been confirmed; another 42 are suspected. \"The government gives us very little information,\" she said. \"I need to be completely sure my boys are fine. I want this hospital to follow up next year and the following year and the one after that.\" 'Not related' Look up \"Fukushima thyroid cancer\" on the internet and you will find a legion of horror stories, predictions that thousands of Fukushima children will get cancer. It's little wonder parents like Miyuki are scared. But should they be? At Fukushima University Medical School Professor Shinichi Suzuki leads the team studying the children of Fukushima. A cheerful round-faced man with a grey moustache, Prof Suzuki is frustrated by the constant likening of Fukushima to Chernobyl. \"The first thing to understand is that the amount of radiation released from Fukushima was much lower than at Chernobyl,\" he said. \"Second, the number of children in Fukushima who got a radiation dose above 50 millisieverts is very few, maybe as low as zero.\" In other words the highest level of exposure children at Fukushima are thought to have received (50 millisieverts) is at the very lowest end of exposure for children in Chernobyl. In that case how does Professor Suzuki explain the 33 confirmed cases of thyroid cancer his team have found? \"In Japan there has never been a survey on this scale done before,\" he said. \"Once you start using very sensitive equipment to check for thyroid cancer in a very large group of children then you will inevitably find an increase in the number of cases. That is why we are seeing the increase now. These cases are not related to the nuclear disaster.\" Prof Suzuki says his team will need to carry on their work for many more years to be sure that the children of Fukushima are in the clear. But he and other experts now say they think there will be very few, or even zero, extra childhood cancers because of Fukushima. 'Took everything' That does not mean that the Fukushima disaster is not taking lives. According to the government's own figures, in the last three years more than 1,600 Fukushima evacuees have died from causes that are \"related to the disaster\" On a freezing March morning I meet 56-year-old Hideko Takeda at a grave yard a few kilometres from the little town of Namie. She has come to burn incense on her father's grave. The black marble is still shiny and new. She has a photograph of him with her. He was tall for a Japanese farmer and at 80 still robust. Each day he still milked the cows and tended his fields. But then the disaster stuck and he was forced to flee, leaving his cows to starve to death in their shed. It broke him, Mrs Takeda says; his health collapsed, within two years he was dead. \"I blame the power company [Tepco] for his death,\" she said. \"They took everything from him, his dreams, his hope. They took his land and scattered his family far from home. Nothing will ever bring those back.\" There is also growing evidence of an increase in suicides among Fukushima evacuees. Mrs Takeda says she knows of several from the villages around her farm. \"One man I know went back to check his house,\" she said. \"When he didn't return his family went to find him. His car was parked outside. He had hanged himself. I think he'd given up, he couldn't see any future.\" So far no one has died from radiation in Fukushima. But unable to return to their homes, scattered in evacuations centres, perhaps lonely and depressed, a growing number of evacuees are dying from anxiety, from suicide or from simply losing the will to live.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize what Miyuki Arakawa is worried about.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "Miyuki Arakawa is worried about the potential health effects of radiation exposure on her two young sons.

It lies just 5km (three miles) north of the sprawling complex that was once the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. By Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Fukushima, Japan You can see the tall white chimneys of the plant peaking over a low hill. I've been to Namie before. Each time I go back is like the first, so arresting is the scene that confronts you. For three years, time here has stood still. An old wooden house brought down by the earthquake still lies in the middle of a road. Through the broken window of a noodle shop I can see used bowls and chopsticks still lying on tables. I look through the windows of an old people's home. Beds lie unmade; laundry hangs from a drier. It's as if the residents have gone off for breakfast and at any moment they'll be shuffling back in. But no one is coming back. When explosions hit the nuclear plant the pall of radiation was blown right across this town. And so Namie remains utterly deserted, its residents scattered far and wide. In their exile they live in constant fear and anxiety. Fear of what the radiation may have done to their children and anxiety that they will never get their old lives back. 'Need to be sure' At a private hospital 60km from the plant I meet Miyuki Arakawa and her two little boys, five-year-old Ryota and three-year-old Haruto. The boys are changing in to hospital pyjamas. They giggle with the nurses. They've done all this before; it's no longer frightening. But it is for their mother. In a narrow room Haruto climbs in to a large blue machine that looks a bit like a bath. The big blue bathtub is the world's first and only infant full-body radiation scanner. Inside Haruto begins to fidget as the data starts to show on a nearby computer screen. \"After the Chernobyl disaster children were diagnosed many years later,\" Miyuki said. \"My boys may be fine now, but if there is any risk I need to find out as soon as possible.\" Her anxiety level has been raised further by the latest government findings. Since 2011 Japan has surveyed 260,000 Fukushima children. So far 33 cases of thyroid cancer have been confirmed; another 42 are suspected. \"The government gives us very little information,\" she said. \"I need to be completely sure my boys are fine. I want this hospital to follow up next year and the following year and the one after that.\" 'Not related' Look up \"Fukushima thyroid cancer\" on the internet and you will find a legion of horror stories, predictions that thousands of Fukushima children will get cancer. It's little wonder parents like Miyuki are scared. But should they be? At Fukushima University Medical School Professor Shinichi Suzuki leads the team studying the children of Fukushima. A cheerful round-faced man with a grey moustache, Prof Suzuki is frustrated by the constant likening of Fukushima to Chernobyl. \"The first thing to understand is that the amount of radiation released from Fukushima was much lower than at Chernobyl,\" he said. \"Second, the number of children in Fukushima who got a radiation dose above 50 millisieverts is very few, maybe as low as zero.\" In other words the highest level of exposure children at Fukushima are thought to have received (50 millisieverts) is at the very lowest end of exposure for children in Chernobyl. In that case how does Professor Suzuki explain the 33 confirmed cases of thyroid cancer his team have found? \"In Japan there has never been a survey on this scale done before,\" he said. \"Once you start using very sensitive equipment to check for thyroid cancer in a very large group of children then you will inevitably find an increase in the number of cases. That is why we are seeing the increase now. These cases are not related to the nuclear disaster.\" Prof Suzuki says his team will need to carry on their work for many more years to be sure that the children of Fukushima are in the clear. But he and other experts now say they think there will be very few, or even zero, extra childhood cancers because of Fukushima. 'Took everything' That does not mean that the Fukushima disaster is not taking lives. According to the government's own figures, in the last three years more than 1,600 Fukushima evacuees have died from causes that are \"related to the disaster\" On a freezing March morning I meet 56-year-old Hideko Takeda at a grave yard a few kilometres from the little town of Namie. She has come to burn incense on her father's grave. The black marble is still shiny and new. She has a photograph of him with her. He was tall for a Japanese farmer and at 80 still robust. Each day he still milked the cows and tended his fields. But then the disaster stuck and he was forced to flee, leaving his cows to starve to death in their shed. It broke him, Mrs Takeda says; his health collapsed, within two years he was dead. \"I blame the power company [Tepco] for his death,\" she said. \"They took everything from him, his dreams, his hope. They took his land and scattered his family far from home. Nothing will ever bring those back.\" There is also growing evidence of an increase in suicides among Fukushima evacuees. Mrs Takeda says she knows of several from the villages around her farm. \"One man I know went back to check his house,\" she said. \"When he didn't return his family went to find him. His car was parked outside. He had hanged himself. I think he'd given up, he couldn't see any future.\" So far no one has died from radiation in Fukushima.

It lies just 5km (three miles) north of the sprawling complex that was once the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. By Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Fukushima, Japan You can see the tall white chimneys of the plant peaking over a low hill. I've been to Namie before. Each time I go back is like the first, so arresting is the scene that confronts you. For three years, time here has stood still. An old wooden house brought down by the earthquake still lies in the middle of a road. Through the broken window of a noodle shop I can see used bowls and chopsticks still lying on tables. I look through the windows of an old people's home. Beds lie unmade; laundry hangs from a drier. It's as if the residents have gone off for breakfast and at any moment they'll be shuffling back in. But no one is coming back. When explosions hit the nuclear plant the pall of radiation was blown right across this town. And so Namie remains utterly deserted, its residents scattered far and wide. In their exile they live in constant fear and anxiety. Fear of what the radiation may have done to their children and anxiety that they will never get their old lives back. 'Need to be sure' At a private hospital 60km from the plant I meet Miyuki Arakawa and her two little boys, five-year-old Ryota and three-year-old Haruto. The boys are changing in to hospital pyjamas. They giggle with the nurses. They've done all this before; it's no longer frightening. But it is for their mother. In a narrow room Haruto climbs in to a large blue machine that looks a bit like a bath. The big blue bathtub is the world's first and only infant full-body radiation scanner. Inside Haruto begins to fidget as the data starts to show on a nearby computer screen. \"After the Chernobyl disaster children were diagnosed many years later,\" Miyuki said. \"My boys may be fine now, but if there is any risk I need to find out as soon as possible.\" Her anxiety level has been raised further by the latest government findings. Since 2011 Japan has surveyed 260,000 Fukushima children. So far 33 cases of thyroid cancer have been confirmed; another 42 are suspected. \"The government gives us very little information,\" she said. \"I need to be completely sure my boys are fine. I want this hospital to follow up next year and the following year and the one after that.\" 'Not related' Look up \"Fukushima thyroid cancer\" on the internet and you will find a legion of horror stories, predictions that thousands of Fukushima children will get cancer. It's little wonder parents like Miyuki are scared. But should they be? At Fukushima University Medical School Professor Shinichi Suzuki leads the team studying the children of Fukushima. A cheerful round-faced man with a grey moustache, Prof Suzuki is frustrated by the constant likening of Fukushima to Chernobyl. \"The first thing to understand is that the amount of radiation released from Fukushima was much lower than at Chernobyl,\" he said. \"Second, the number of children in Fukushima who got a radiation dose above 50 millisieverts is very few, maybe as low as zero.\" In other words the highest level of exposure children at Fukushima are thought to have received (50 millisieverts) is at the very lowest end of exposure for children in Chernobyl. In that case how does Professor Suzuki explain the 33 confirmed cases of thyroid cancer his team have found? \"In Japan there has never been a survey on this scale done before,\" he said. \"Once you start using very sensitive equipment to check for thyroid cancer in a very large group of children then you will inevitably find an increase in the number of cases. That is why we are seeing the increase now. These cases are not related to the nuclear disaster.\" Prof Suzuki says his team will need to carry on their work for many more years to be sure that the children of Fukushima are in the clear. But he and other experts now say they think there will be very few, or even zero, extra childhood cancers because of Fukushima. 'Took everything' That does not mean that the Fukushima disaster is not taking lives. According to the government's own figures, in the last three years more than 1,600 Fukushima evacuees have died from causes that are \"related to the disaster\" On a freezing March morning I meet 56-year-old Hideko Takeda at a grave yard a few kilometres from the little town of Namie. She has come to burn incense on her father's grave. The black marble is still shiny and new. She has a photograph of him with her. He was tall for a Japanese farmer and at 80 still robust. Each day he still milked the cows and tended his fields. But then the disaster stuck and he was forced to flee, leaving his cows to starve to death in their shed. It broke him, Mrs Takeda says; his health collapsed, within two years he was dead. \"I blame the power company [Tepco] for his death,\" she said. \"They took everything from him, his dreams, his hope. They took his land and scattered his family far from home. Nothing will ever bring those back.\" There is also growing evidence of an increase in suicides among Fukushima evacuees. Mrs Takeda says she knows of several from the villages around her farm. \"One man I know went back to check his house,\" she said. \"When he didn't return his family went to find him. His car was parked outside. He had hanged himself. I think he'd given up, he couldn't see any future.\" So far no one has died from radiation in Fukushima. But unable to return to their homes, scattered in evacuations centres, perhaps lonely and depressed, a growing number of evacuees are dying from anxiety, from suicide or from simply losing the will to live.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize what Miyuki Arakawa is worried about.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:\n\n# Output (a):\nMiyuki Arakawa is worried about the potential risk of radiation exposure to her two little boys, who are being scanned in a full-body radiation scanner at a private hospital 60km from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

In that case how does Professor Suzuki explain the 33 confirmed cases of thyroid cancer his team have found? \"In Japan there has never been a survey on this scale done before,\" he said. \"Once you start using very sensitive equipment to check for thyroid cancer in a very large group of children then you will inevitably find an increase in the number of cases. That is why we are seeing the increase now. These cases are not related to the nuclear disaster.\" Prof Suzuki says his team will need to carry on their work for many more years to be sure that the children of Fukushima are in the clear. But he and other experts now say they think there will be very few, or even zero, extra childhood cancers because of Fukushima. 'Took everything' That does not mean that the Fukushima disaster is not taking lives. According to the government's own figures, in the last three years more than 1,600 Fukushima evacuees have died from causes that are \"related to the disaster\" On a freezing March morning I meet 56-year-old Hideko Takeda at a grave yard a few kilometres from the little town of Namie. She has come to burn incense on her father's grave. The black marble is still shiny and new. She has a photograph of him with her. He was tall for a Japanese farmer and at 80 still robust. Each day he still milked the cows and tended his fields. But then the disaster stuck and he was forced to flee, leaving his cows to starve to death in their shed. It broke him, Mrs Takeda says; his health collapsed, within two years he was dead. \"I blame the power company [Tepco] for his death,\" she said. \"They took everything from him, his dreams, his hope. They took his land and scattered his family far from home. Nothing will ever bring those back.\" There is also growing evidence of an increase in suicides among Fukushima evacuees. Mrs Takeda says she knows of several from the villages around her farm. \"One man I know went back to check his house,\" she said. \"When he didn't return his family went to find him. His car was parked outside. He had hanged himself. I think he'd given up, he couldn't see any future.\" So far no one has died from radiation in Fukushima.

You can see them but your brain cannot process the information - you don't know whether they are smiling, or understand their emotions. By Gabriela TorresBBC Mundo health reporter That is what happened to David Bromley, after he suffered a brain injury that left him with face blindness. David has prosopagnosia. People with this condition can see the eyes, the nose, and the mouth, what is known as the context - but they cannot see them as a whole. They do not recognise gestures or emotions. \"I can even recognise my wife if I walk into the house and know that she is there,\" says David. \"But if I'm in the street and she passes by and I don't know that she is going to be there, I wouldn't recognise her.\" David, who lives in Essex, had unknowingly been living with eye damage since birth - the arteries and veins were mixed up. This eventually caused a partial loss of sight and damage in the brain which caused the prosopagnosia. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of this condition is that people do not notice right away that something is wrong with them. 'Social embarrassment' He remembers when he realised there was a problem. \"I went to a reunion where I saw friends that I hadn't seen for 30 years. We were pretty close but we went our separate ways.\" On the way home, he told his brother-in-law: \"'Fran and Mickey haven't changed a bit, they are exactly the same!'. And then I said 'hold on, were they wearing tank tops?'\" What David was seeing was his memory of their friends back then. \"My brain was telling me that there they were and what they looked like, but that wasn't the reality\". After that, he discovered he was face blind. There are two main forms of prosopagnosia; developmental - where people fail to develop face processing abilities which is thought to affect around 2% of the population, and acquired, which develops after some form of brain injury and is much rarer. Dr Ashok Jansari, a cognitive neuropsychology expert from the University of East London said: \"Acquired prosopagnosia is extremely rare because the type of brain damage is very specific,. \"It can be caused by damage to the back of the brain on the right-hand side in an area known generally as the right occipito-temporal region.\" David said: \"I don't know what's worse - not being able to ever recognise people or at 56 years old - as it happened to me - suddenly not being able to recognise anybody\". He added that the worst part is the social embarrassment. \"We were on holiday in Cuba and I'd been snorkelling in the sea. I was talking with this guy from Denmark, when this woman swam up and said 'buenos dias' and I went 'hello, pleased to meet you', thinking it was his wife, but it was actually my wife and I hadn't recognised her.\" David can see people perfectly well - but 10 or 15 minutes later he cannot recognise them. He now tells clients: \"If I ignore you, I'm not being rude, it is just that I can't recognise you.\" Job fears Sandra, from London, who only wants to give her first name, is also afraid of social embarrassment. She had encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - 14 years ago, which left her with face blindness. Even though her prosopagnosia is mild - she can recognise people she knew before her illness - she would rather not let people know because she does not want anyone to think she has some sort of incapacity. \"Life with prosopagnosia is very shameful,\" she says. She is teacher and at work almost nobody knows that she is face blind. \"If I see someone every day, I can recognise them. But if one of the children says hi to me on the street, I would know it is a student from the school, but I wouldn't know who. \"I don't say anything to the children, I just work every day to learn their faces.\" But she says: \"Perhaps the reason why I don't mention it is because I don't want them to think that I cannot do my job, because that's not true. I don't want to feel ashamed or that people think that there is something wrong with me.\" Dr Jansari understands the feelings and fears of David and Sandra. He knows of cases in which people have lost their jobs because of the condition - including a teacher who had difficulty recognising pupils, causing problems when parents came to pick up their children at the end of the day, Even though prosopagnosia is not recognised as a disability, Dr Jansari thinks it should be treated as such in some cases. This condition has no cure. \"In the case of acquired prosopagnosia, once a part of the brain is damaged it is not going to 'grow' back, so it is impossible to fix the problem,\" he said. \"With developmental prosopagnosia, we don't know what causes it, but hypothetically in the future if they find that there is a genetic cause, that could be corrected - but that would be a very long way off.\" Even though people develop strategies to cope - because people change their appearance, they are not foolproof. Dr Jansari says: \"Once David thought that a photograph he saw was of George Michael but it was of me, from a time when I used to have a goatee beard and a gold earring!\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the symptoms of prosopagnosia.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:\n\n# Output (a):\nProsopagnosia is a condition in which people have difficulty recognizing faces. People with prosopagnosia can see the eyes, nose, and mouth, but they cannot see them as a whole. They do not recognize gestures or emotions.\n\n# Output (b):\nProsopagnosia is a condition in which people cannot recognize faces, even if they can see the eyes, nose, and mouth. People with this condition cannot recognize gestures or emotions, and may not recognize even close friends or family members if they are not expecting to see them. It can be caused by birth defects or brain injuries, and has no cure. People with prosopagnosia may develop strategies to cope, but these are not foolproof.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nOutput (a) is better.\n\nExplanation:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) provide a summary of the symptoms of prosopagnosia. However, Output (a) is more concise and accurately captures the essence of the condition. It mentions that people with prosopagnosia cannot recognize faces, despite being able to see the eyes, nose, and mouth. Output (b), on the other hand, provides more context but does not convey the severity of the condition as well as Output (a). Therefore, Output (a) is better for summarizing the symptoms of prosopagnosia.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nAfter evaluating the two outputs, I find that Output (b) is better. This is because Output (b) provides a more comprehensive summary of the symptoms of prosopagnosia. It not only mentions the difficulty in recognizing faces but also the inability to recognize gestures or emotions, which is an important aspect of the condition. Output (a) only briefly touches upon the inability to recognize gestures or emotions, while Output (b) provides a more detailed explanation of this symptom. Additionally, Output (b) mentions that prosopagnosia has no cure and that people with the condition may develop strategies to cope, but these are not foolproof.

You can see them but your brain cannot process the information - you don't know whether they are smiling, or understand their emotions. By Gabriela TorresBBC Mundo health reporter That is what happened to David Bromley, after he suffered a brain injury that left him with face blindness. David has prosopagnosia. People with this condition can see the eyes, the nose, and the mouth, what is known as the context - but they cannot see them as a whole. They do not recognise gestures or emotions. \"I can even recognise my wife if I walk into the house and know that she is there,\" says David. \"But if I'm in the street and she passes by and I don't know that she is going to be there, I wouldn't recognise her.\" David, who lives in Essex, had unknowingly been living with eye damage since birth - the arteries and veins were mixed up. This eventually caused a partial loss of sight and damage in the brain which caused the prosopagnosia. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of this condition is that people do not notice right away that something is wrong with them. 'Social embarrassment' He remembers when he realised there was a problem. \"I went to a reunion where I saw friends that I hadn't seen for 30 years. We were pretty close but we went our separate ways.\" On the way home, he told his brother-in-law: \"'Fran and Mickey haven't changed a bit, they are exactly the same!'. And then I said 'hold on, were they wearing tank tops?'\" What David was seeing was his memory of their friends back then. \"My brain was telling me that there they were and what they looked like, but that wasn't the reality\". After that, he discovered he was face blind. There are two main forms of prosopagnosia; developmental - where people fail to develop face processing abilities which is thought to affect around 2% of the population, and acquired, which develops after some form of brain injury and is much rarer. Dr Ashok Jansari, a cognitive neuropsychology expert from the University of East London said: \"Acquired prosopagnosia is extremely rare because the type of brain damage is very specific,. \"It can be caused by damage to the back of the brain on the right-hand side in an area known generally as the right occipito-temporal region.\" David said: \"I don't know what's worse - not being able to ever recognise people or at 56 years old - as it happened to me - suddenly not being able to recognise anybody\". He added that the worst part is the social embarrassment. \"We were on holiday in Cuba and I'd been snorkelling in the sea. I was talking with this guy from Denmark, when this woman swam up and said 'buenos dias' and I went 'hello, pleased to meet you', thinking it was his wife, but it was actually my wife and I hadn't recognised her.\" David can see people perfectly well - but 10 or 15 minutes later he cannot recognise them. He now tells clients: \"If I ignore you, I'm not being rude, it is just that I can't recognise you.\" Job fears Sandra, from London, who only wants to give her first name, is also afraid of social embarrassment. She had encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - 14 years ago, which left her with face blindness. Even though her prosopagnosia is mild - she can recognise people she knew before her illness - she would rather not let people know because she does not want anyone to think she has some sort of incapacity. \"Life with prosopagnosia is very shameful,\" she says. She is teacher and at work almost nobody knows that she is face blind. \"If I see someone every day, I can recognise them. But if one of the children says hi to me on the street, I would know it is a student from the school, but I wouldn't know who. \"I don't say anything to the children, I just work every day to learn their faces.\" But she says: \"Perhaps the reason why I don't mention it is because I don't want them to think that I cannot do my job, because that's not true. I don't want to feel ashamed or that people think that there is something wrong with me.\" Dr Jansari understands the feelings and fears of David and Sandra. He knows of cases in which people have lost their jobs because of the condition - including a teacher who had difficulty recognising pupils, causing problems when parents came to pick up their children at the end of the day, Even though prosopagnosia is not recognised as a disability, Dr Jansari thinks it should be treated as such in some cases. This condition has no cure. \"In the case of acquired prosopagnosia, once a part of the brain is damaged it is not going to 'grow' back, so it is impossible to fix the problem,\" he said. \"With developmental prosopagnosia, we don't know what causes it, but hypothetically in the future if they find that there is a genetic cause, that could be corrected - but that would be a very long way off.\" Even though people develop strategies to cope - because people change their appearance, they are not foolproof.

He arrived two months ago in the town of Brasileia, near the border with Peru and Bolivia, and is one of 1,300 foreigners waiting for a visa to work in Brazil. The centre is meant to shelter just 200 people. Many who came were attracted by reports of the South American country's growing economy and job opportunities leading up to the 2014 World Cup. After entering Brazil, however, they were taken to a place with few toilets and no showers, surrounded by mud. The vast border of South America's largest country makes it very difficult to stop this flow. Officials in Acre have declared a \"social emergency\" in Brasileia and one other town, asking for help from the federal government including the use of security forces to try to contain the problem. State Governor Tiao Viana describes the influx as a \"human tragedy\", calling for action from the Brazilian and Peruvian governments to address the situation. He told BBC Mundo there was now a well established international route into Brazil and people from as far away as Bangladesh and Nigeria were aware of it. \"Intelligence agencies have identified the presence of 'coyotes' [people smugglers] earning a lot of money. And that is something we are worried about,\" he said. \"We cannot imagine that Brazil is going to solve the problems of the world and Africa.\" State Secretary for Human Rights Nilson Mourao warned of a possible health crisis. \"Miraculously, everyone is healthy,\" he said. \"But if there is any epidemic at the shelter we wouldn't know what to do,\" he added, noting that outbreaks of dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, are common in the region. Haitian connection These 1,300 immigrants have caused a great impact on Brasileia, a quiet town with about 20,000 inhabitants. The town has limited resources and basic medical facilities. The relationship between foreigners and locals is peaceful, but residents say it is getting harder to schedule medical appointments and that the streets are dirtier. Some even say they are afraid to go into the streets at night, although there has been no recent increase in crime. \"When they first arrived we helped them a lot. But now they are too many and problems begin to arise,\" says pensioner Raimundo Soares. Brasileia stands in the heart of the Amazon region in the north-west of the country, thousands of miles from the more developed south and south-east regions. Most of the immigrants have fled Haiti where an earthquake in 2010 wrecked the economy. Since 2011 an estimated 5,600 have arrived, crossing over from Peru and Bolivia. But now the route is also used by migrants from countries such as Senegal, Nigeria, the Dominican Republic and even Bangladesh. Haitians, however, get special treatment from the Brazilian government. In 2012, the national immigration board started granting 1,200 annual work visas to families from the Caribbean island to meet the growing influx. But the number of visas proved to be much lower than the demand. Over the past 15 days more than 1,300 Haitians crossed the border into Acre, more than the annual quota of visas. The government then started giving extra visas at the border. But although Haitians receive visas within days or weeks, workers of other nationalities face uncertainties. Waiting game An official said non-Haitian immigrants would only be interviewed by authorities when the situation in the shelter eases. Even then, he says, they may have their requests denied. One immigrant who asked not to be named said: \"The situation where I come from is as bad as in Haiti, so why does the Brazilian government treat us differently?\" This man says that if he doesn't get a visa he will apply for refugee status in Brazil. Most of the eight Dominicans in the shelter say they have been waiting for a month. One of them, fearing he will not be able to leave soon, started selling ham and cheese sandwiches to other immigrants to cover his expenses. \"There is no other option, so we have to wait,\" he says. To get to Brazil, he flew to Ecuador and travelled by bus through Peru and Bolivia. The trip took him three days. The 72 Senegalese faced an even tougher journey. They went from Senegal's capital Dakar to Morocco by bus, crossing Mauritania. Then they flew to Spain and to Ecuador, where they joined groups of Haitians. Some have been encouraged to come by friends who already live in the country. Others say they had no plans to live in Brazil but the economic crisis has made it harder to migrate to Europe and to the US. If they get their visas there is reason for optimism. After this route became popular many Brazilian companies started visiting the shelter to hire new workers. On Wednesday an entrepreneur took 50 Haitians to work in a food industry in Parana State in the south of Brazil.

He told BBC Mundo there was now a well established international route into Brazil and people from as far away as Bangladesh and Nigeria were aware of it. \"Intelligence agencies have identified the presence of 'coyotes' [people smugglers] earning a lot of money. And that is something we are worried about,\" he said. \"We cannot imagine that Brazil is going to solve the problems of the world and Africa.\" State Secretary for Human Rights Nilson Mourao warned of a possible health crisis. \"Miraculously, everyone is healthy,\" he said. \"But if there is any epidemic at the shelter we wouldn't know what to do,\" he added, noting that outbreaks of dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, are common in the region. Haitian connection These 1,300 immigrants have caused a great impact on Brasileia, a quiet town with about 20,000 inhabitants. The town has limited resources and basic medical facilities. The relationship between foreigners and locals is peaceful, but residents say it is getting harder to schedule medical appointments and that the streets are dirtier. Some even say they are afraid to go into the streets at night, although there has been no recent increase in crime. \"When they first arrived we helped them a lot. But now they are too many and problems begin to arise,\" says pensioner Raimundo Soares. Brasileia stands in the heart of the Amazon region in the north-west of the country, thousands of miles from the more developed south and south-east regions. Most of the immigrants have fled Haiti where an earthquake in 2010 wrecked the economy. Since 2011 an estimated 5,600 have arrived, crossing over from Peru and Bolivia. But now the route is also used by migrants from countries such as Senegal, Nigeria, the Dominican Republic and even Bangladesh. Haitians, however, get special treatment from the Brazilian government. In 2012, the national immigration board started granting 1,200 annual work visas to families from the Caribbean island to meet the growing influx. But the number of visas proved to be much lower than the demand. Over the past 15 days more than 1,300 Haitians crossed the border into Acre, more than the annual quota of visas. The government then started giving extra visas at the border. But although Haitians receive visas within days or weeks, workers of other nationalities face uncertainties. Waiting game An official said non-Haitian immigrants would only be interviewed by authorities when the situation in the shelter eases. Even then, he says, they may have their requests denied. One immigrant who asked not to be named said: \"The situation where I come from is as bad as in Haiti, so why does the Brazilian government treat us differently?\" This man says that if he doesn't get a visa he will apply for refugee status in Brazil. Most of the eight Dominicans in the shelter say they have been waiting for a month. One of them, fearing he will not be able to leave soon, started selling ham and cheese sandwiches to other immigrants to cover his expenses. \"There is no other option, so we have to wait,\" he says. To get to Brazil, he flew to Ecuador and travelled by bus through Peru and Bolivia. The trip took him three days. The 72 Senegalese faced an even tougher journey. They went from Senegal's capital Dakar to Morocco by bus, crossing Mauritania. Then they flew to Spain and to Ecuador, where they joined groups of Haitians. Some have been encouraged to come by friends who already live in the country. Others say they had no plans to live in Brazil but the economic crisis has made it harder to migrate to Europe and to the US. If they get their visas there is reason for optimism.

The mothers speak about their isolation, uncertainty and the pressure placed on their mental health by the pandemic, but some say they were also able to find \"silver linings\" and positives that have come out of an extraordinary joint experience. By Emma HallettBBC News Born in Lockdown is the result of a writing project set up by Bristol novelist Emylia Hall, the founder of creative writing course Mothership Writers. \"The coronavirus pandemic has intensified what is already a challenging time, making the need for self-expression ever more vital,\" Mrs Hall said. \"The idea was to encourage writing for pleasure and purpose... and, together, to tell the story of what it was like to become a new mum in 2020.\" The mums were asked to write in fragments, each comprising of no more than a handful of sentences or 50 words, that could be scribbled during a night-feed or recorded as a voice note. 'Tears streamed' Mrs Hall said: \"They captured moments and emotions that were so raw, affecting, and inspiring, my tears streamed as I saved each one.\" She initially thought she would need around 20 mums to contribute, but as word spread, she ended up with 277 authors from across the UK. \"One of my favourite lines in our book is 'the very thing keeping you apart right now will one day bond you together'. \"Born in Lockdown was made in exactly that spirit,\" she said. Roxy Afzal, from Manchester, said the project gave her the chance to \"be really honest, but without moaning\". The 37-year-old had every reason to think 2020 would be one of the happiest years of her life with her first baby due in May. But the neonatal nurse found her pregnancy, birth and maternity leave all heavily impacted by the pandemic, with her baby shower cancelled, shops closed, and then in October, losing her father to Covid. \"We were really looking forward to being parents. I was looking forward to maternity leave, we were ready for it,\" she said. \"It really feels like I have been robbed. 'No support' \"There was always going to be the sleepless nights and hiccups with feeding, but you sign up for that...you don't sign up for not having any support and not having your family and friends around.\" Aged just seven weeks, Miss Afzal's son was readmitted to hospital for surgery, an experience she had to go through without her partner. Two months later, her father - who had not yet met his grandson - died. She said that \"tipped her over\" and she is now receiving treatment for postnatal depression. Born in Lockdown has given her an outlet to think about the best and worst moments of the last year, she added. For Lisa Bywater, writing is her way of \"capturing\" her life and having something to leave behind. Like many in 2020 she was forced to confront her own mortality, but for Lisa, this came a few months before the pandemic when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, while six months pregnant. She gave birth to her daughter Connie six weeks prematurely in January. The 37 year-old, from Forest Hill in London, was then faced with leaving her tiny baby in intensive care so she could start her cancer treatment. \"I was only about three or four days postpartum so you've got all those emotions going through you and I was sat in the waiting room with all these seriously ill people and I was suddenly confronted with this thought that this is really serious,\" she said. 'Humbling' Mrs Bywater stated chemotherapy a month before the March lockdown. As the year went on, she found herself attending chemotherapy alone as restrictions tightened. She said: \"There was that feeling of very much being alone. Just having no-one to turn to at all.\" The former bookseller was alerted to Born in Lockdown via an online expectant mothers group. \"I felt like I had things I wanted to say, but no idea how to find the time between nappy changes and hospital appointments to start saying them, but this project seemed really manageable,\" she said. \"I still have a lot to process from a year, and counting, of parenting and being a cancer patient during a pandemic, but being part of this amazing project has been cathartic, inspirational and humbling.\" Tessa Wills describes herself as \"an older, single, queer, parent by choice\". She said she enjoyed feeling part of a collective voice in this time of isolation. \"It just creates these really precious memories and this is a phenomenal thing to be living through,\" she said. \"There is definitely going to be a lot of reflection on it afterwards, culturally, so it is really important to be trying to write right now and capturing it.\" 'Unflinchingly honest' The 43-year-old lives in Mark, Somerset, and gave birth to her second baby, Juniper Star, in October. Over the past year she has had to move in with her elderly parents and pay for a live-in-nanny, for support. \"It was really hard for me to come to terms with how vulnerable I have made myself, us, through being a single parent,\" she said. \"I have properly been brought to my knees through this, with the realisation I actually can't do this by myself. I am very dependent on other people.\" 'Love and hope' Reflecting on the collection, Mrs Hall said it was \"a remarkable record of new motherhood at this time; an unflinchingly honest and moving account, where, despite the pain and hardship, resilience and love and hope shine through\". She added: \"My heartfelt thanks go to all of the 277 new mothers who were willing to trust me with their stories, and to unite - across distance, through lockdown - to make something so special. \"And to remind us, ultimately, that we're all in this together.\" Born in Lockdown is available to download for free from the Mothership Writers website from 23 February, with funds from voluntary donations going to the stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands.

The mothers speak about their isolation, uncertainty and the pressure placed on their mental health by the pandemic, but some say they were also able to find \"silver linings\" and positives that have come out of an extraordinary joint experience. By Emma HallettBBC News Born in Lockdown is the result of a writing project set up by Bristol novelist Emylia Hall, the founder of creative writing course Mothership Writers. \"The coronavirus pandemic has intensified what is already a challenging time, making the need for self-expression ever more vital,\" Mrs Hall said. \"The idea was to encourage writing for pleasure and purpose... and, together, to tell the story of what it was like to become a new mum in 2020.\" The mums were asked to write in fragments, each comprising of no more than a handful of sentences or 50 words, that could be scribbled during a night-feed or recorded as a voice note. 'Tears streamed' Mrs Hall said: \"They captured moments and emotions that were so raw, affecting, and inspiring, my tears streamed as I saved each one.\" She initially thought she would need around 20 mums to contribute, but as word spread, she ended up with 277 authors from across the UK. \"One of my favourite lines in our book is 'the very thing keeping you apart right now will one day bond you together'. \"Born in Lockdown was made in exactly that spirit,\" she said. Roxy Afzal, from Manchester, said the project gave her the chance to \"be really honest, but without moaning\". The 37-year-old had every reason to think 2020 would be one of the happiest years of her life with her first baby due in May. But the neonatal nurse found her pregnancy, birth and maternity leave all heavily impacted by the pandemic, with her baby shower cancelled, shops closed, and then in October, losing her father to Covid. \"We were really looking forward to being parents. I was looking forward to maternity leave, we were ready for it,\" she said. \"It really feels like I have been robbed. 'No support' \"There was always going to be the sleepless nights and hiccups with feeding, but you sign up for that...you don't sign up for not having any support and not having your family and friends around.\" Aged just seven weeks, Miss Afzal's son was readmitted to hospital for surgery, an experience she had to go through without her partner. Two months later, her father - who had not yet met his grandson - died. She said that \"tipped her over\" and she is now receiving treatment for postnatal depression. Born in Lockdown has given her an outlet to think about the best and worst moments of the last year, she added. For Lisa Bywater, writing is her way of \"capturing\" her life and having something to leave behind. Like many in 2020 she was forced to confront her own mortality, but for Lisa, this came a few months before the pandemic when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, while six months pregnant. She gave birth to her daughter Connie six weeks prematurely in January. The 37 year-old, from Forest Hill in London, was then faced with leaving her tiny baby in intensive care so she could start her cancer treatment. \"I was only about three or four days postpartum so you've got all those emotions going through you and I was sat in the waiting room with all these seriously ill people and I was suddenly confronted with this thought that this is really serious,\" she said. 'Humbling' Mrs Bywater stated chemotherapy a month before the March lockdown. As the year went on, she found herself attending chemotherapy alone as restrictions tightened. She said: \"There was that feeling of very much being alone. Just having no-one to turn to at all.\" The former bookseller was alerted to Born in Lockdown via an online expectant mothers group. \"I felt like I had things I wanted to say, but no idea how to find the time between nappy changes and hospital appointments to start saying them, but this project seemed really manageable,\" she said. \"I still have a lot to process from a year, and counting, of parenting and being a cancer patient during a pandemic, but being part of this amazing project has been cathartic, inspirational and humbling.\" Tessa Wills describes herself as \"an older, single, queer, parent by choice\". She said she enjoyed feeling part of a collective voice in this time of isolation. \"It just creates these really precious memories and this is a phenomenal thing to be living through,\" she said. \"There is definitely going to be a lot of reflection on it afterwards, culturally, so it is really important to be trying to write right now and capturing it.\" 'Unflinchingly honest' The 43-year-old lives in Mark, Somerset, and gave birth to her second baby, Juniper Star, in October. Over the past year she has had to move in with her elderly parents and pay for a live-in-nanny, for support. \"It was really hard for me to come to terms with how vulnerable I have made myself, us, through being a single parent,\" she said. \"I have properly been brought to my knees through this, with the realisation I actually can't do this by myself. I am very dependent on other people.\" 'Love and hope' Reflecting on the collection, Mrs Hall said it was \"a remarkable record of new motherhood at this time; an unflinchingly honest and moving account, where, despite the pain and hardship, resilience and love and hope shine through\". She added: \"My heartfelt thanks go to all of the 277 new mothers who were willing to trust me with their stories, and to unite - across distance, through lockdown - to make something so special. \"And to remind us, ultimately, that we're all in this together.\" Born in Lockdown is available to download for free from the Mothership Writers website from 23 February, with funds from voluntary donations going to the stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands.

Patralekha Chatterjee reports on how the country appears to have finally managed to beat the disease. Despite a healthcare system beset by severe problems, India has ushered in the new year with an achievement to be proud of. In 2009, India reported 741 polio cases, more than any other country in the world, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. The last case was reported from the eastern state of West Bengal in 2011, when an 18-month-old girl was found to have contracted the disease. The country faced unique challenges in eradicating polio. Among them was the high population density and birth rate, poor sanitation, widespread diarrhoea, inaccessible terrain and reluctance of a section of the population, notably members of the Muslim community in certain pockets, to accept the polio vaccine. Nicole Deutsch, head of polio operations in India for UN children's charity Unicef, said: \"Despite these obstacles, India proved to the world how to conquer this disease: through the strong commitment of the government, seamless partnership comprising the government, Rotary clubs, WHO and Unicef, and above all the tireless hard work of millions of front-line workers - vaccinators, social mobilisers and community and health workers - who continue to implement innovative strategies to rid India of polio,\" The introduction of bivalent oral polio vaccine in 2010 also helped India to battle the disease. Previously, India had been using a monovalent vaccine that protected only against type 1 poliovirus transmission, not type 3. which was causing repeated disease outbreaks. But it was organisation that was key in enabling India to cover the last mile in its battle against polio. In a vast country of more than a billion people who are culturally, economically, linguistically and socially diverse, \"micro-plans\" helped because they tossed up precious data about the specifics of a particular place - areas to be covered by each vaccination team on each day of the immunisation campaign, names and designations of the vaccinators, supervisors and community workers assigned to the area along with the vaccine, logistics distribution plan and so on. But data alone did not deliver results. Unicef set up the Social Mobilisation Network for polio in 2001 in northern Uttar Pradesh state. The initiative was a response to resistance against the polio vaccine. Families were refusing to immunise their children in some districts in Uttar Pradesh. There were many reasons why this happened - parents did not see polio as a risk; repeated immunisation rounds had created doubts in their minds; and some believed rumours that linked the polio vaccine to impotency. The Indian government and its polio partners realised that a new approach was needed. This led to strategies to make polio vaccination more acceptable among people who had been resisting it. 'Holistic' Children who suffered from severe bouts of diarrhoea did not fully benefit from the oral polio vaccine. So, community mobilisers started talking about the need for hand-washing, hygiene and sanitation, exclusive breastfeeding up to the age of six months, diarrhoea management with zinc and oral rehydration therapy, and routine immunisation, necessary to sustain the success of polio eradication. This holistic approach has paid off. India's polio campaign gathered momentum when it focused on marginalised and mobile people, and began working in earnest with religious leaders in Muslim communities to urge parents to immunise their children. For example, in Bihar in eastern India - once a polio hotspot in the country - a key focus of the polio programme is migrants. In recent years, continuous vaccination has been conducted at 51 transit locations at the state's international border with Nepal and 11 important railway stations. Bihar also saw special drives during popular festivals and fairs. While India appears to have stopped indigenous transmission of wild poliovirus, the risk of importation is real and has increased since 2013 with outbreaks in the Horn of Africa region and the Middle East, in addition to the continuing poliovirus transmission in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. \"India needs to stay extremely vigilant and continue its efforts to ensure that the children remain protected against polio, until the disease is eradicated globally,\" said Nicole Deutsch of Unicef. \"India plans six polio campaigns in 2014 and 2015. In each campaign, 2.3 million vaccinators will immunise nearly 172 million children.\" India has also set up polio immunisation posts along the international borders with Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Burma and Bhutan to vaccinate all children up to the age of five years crossing the international borders. India's dramatic turnaround paves the way for polio-free certification of the entire South East Asia Region of the World Health Organization. The South-East Asia Regional Certification Commission for Polio Eradication (RCCPE) is expected to meet in Delhi in the last week of March 2014. \"If the commission is convinced that there is no wild poliovirus in the region and the surveillance quality is good enough to pick up any wild poliovirus and phase 1 laboratory containment work has been completed, it will certify the South East Asia Region of WHO as polio-free,\" a WHO spokesperson told the BBC. India's successful control of polio has had other benefits. A health ministry official connected with India's National Polio Surveillance Project (NPSP), a collaboration between the government and the WHO, said strategies that worked in the case of polio were now being used to push up routine immunisation. This is good news. Too many Indian children still die because they do not get the vital vaccines.

Patralekha Chatterjee reports on how the country appears to have finally managed to beat the disease. Despite a healthcare system beset by severe problems, India has ushered in the new year with an achievement to be proud of. In 2009, India reported 741 polio cases, more than any other country in the world, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. The last case was reported from the eastern state of West Bengal in 2011, when an 18-month-old girl was found to have contracted the disease. The country faced unique challenges in eradicating polio. Among them was the high population density and birth rate, poor sanitation, widespread diarrhoea, inaccessible terrain and reluctance of a section of the population, notably members of the Muslim community in certain pockets, to accept the polio vaccine. Nicole Deutsch, head of polio operations in India for UN children's charity Unicef, said: \"Despite these obstacles, India proved to the world how to conquer this disease: through the strong commitment of the government, seamless partnership comprising the government, Rotary clubs, WHO and Unicef, and above all the tireless hard work of millions of front-line workers - vaccinators, social mobilisers and community and health workers - who continue to implement innovative strategies to rid India of polio,\" The introduction of bivalent oral polio vaccine in 2010 also helped India to battle the disease. Previously, India had been using a monovalent vaccine that protected only against type 1 poliovirus transmission, not type 3. which was causing repeated disease outbreaks. But it was organisation that was key in enabling India to cover the last mile in its battle against polio. In a vast country of more than a billion people who are culturally, economically, linguistically and socially diverse, \"micro-plans\" helped because they tossed up precious data about the specifics of a particular place - areas to be covered by each vaccination team on each day of the immunisation campaign, names and designations of the vaccinators, supervisors and community workers assigned to the area along with the vaccine, logistics distribution plan and so on. But data alone did not deliver results. Unicef set up the Social Mobilisation Network for polio in 2001 in northern Uttar Pradesh state. The initiative was a response to resistance against the polio vaccine. Families were refusing to immunise their children in some districts in Uttar Pradesh. There were many reasons why this happened - parents did not see polio as a risk; repeated immunisation rounds had created doubts in their minds; and some believed rumours that linked the polio vaccine to impotency. The Indian government and its polio partners realised that a new approach was needed. This led to strategies to make polio vaccination more acceptable among people who had been resisting it. 'Holistic' Children who suffered from severe bouts of diarrhoea did not fully benefit from the oral polio vaccine. So, community mobilisers started talking about the need for hand-washing, hygiene and sanitation, exclusive breastfeeding up to the age of six months, diarrhoea management with zinc and oral rehydration therapy, and routine immunisation, necessary to sustain the success of polio eradication. This holistic approach has paid off. India's polio campaign gathered momentum when it focused on marginalised and mobile people, and began working in earnest with religious leaders in Muslim communities to urge parents to immunise their children. For example, in Bihar in eastern India - once a polio hotspot in the country - a key focus of the polio programme is migrants. In recent years, continuous vaccination has been conducted at 51 transit locations at the state's international border with Nepal and 11 important railway stations. Bihar also saw special drives during popular festivals and fairs. While India appears to have stopped indigenous transmission of wild poliovirus, the risk of importation is real and has increased since 2013 with outbreaks in the Horn of Africa region and the Middle East, in addition to the continuing poliovirus transmission in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. \"India needs to stay extremely vigilant and continue its efforts to ensure that the children remain protected against polio, until the disease is eradicated globally,\" said Nicole Deutsch of Unicef. \"India plans six polio campaigns in 2014 and 2015. In each campaign, 2.3 million vaccinators will immunise nearly 172 million children.\" India has also set up polio immunisation posts along the international borders with Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Burma and Bhutan to vaccinate all children up to the age of five years crossing the international borders. India's dramatic turnaround paves the way for polio-free certification of the entire South East Asia Region of the World Health Organization. The South-East Asia Regional Certification Commission for Polio Eradication (RCCPE) is expected to meet in Delhi in the last week of March 2014. \"If the commission is convinced that there is no wild poliovirus in the region and the surveillance quality is good enough to pick up any wild poliovirus and phase 1 laboratory containment work has been completed, it will certify the South East Asia Region of WHO as polio-free,\" a WHO spokesperson told the BBC. India's successful control of polio has had other benefits. A health ministry official connected with India's National Polio Surveillance Project (NPSP), a collaboration between the government and the WHO, said strategies that worked in the case of polio were now being used to push up routine immunisation.

By Mario Cacciottolo Malta It is estimated that hundreds of women leave Malta each year to have an abortion overseas, usually in the UK or Italy. Others illegally buy abortion pills online. Their stories inspired Maltese journalist Herman Grech to write and direct a play called De-terminated. Its script is based on the real-life experiences of abortion of seven people, both women and men, and it premieres in Valletta on Friday night. Tackling taboos \"Abortion is not only a taboo here, there's almost a fear of using the 'A' word,\" said Grech, a prominent Maltese journalist and occasional contributor to the BBC. \"When you know hundreds of women are resorting to dangerous methods to get a termination then it becomes a subject that needs to be tackled.\" One character has had her profession changed in the play, because her real-life counterpart says she would lose her job if the Maltese authorities discovered she had an abortion abroad. Another is based on a man who was sexually abused as a child, became promiscuous, later coerced his pregnant girlfriend into terminating their child, then found God, and now campaigns against abortion. Grech says he didn't write the play to campaign for either side. \"In Malta there are only ever two sides to choose from... everything's yes or no, there are no shades of grey,\" he says. \"Stop shouting at each other, and maybe we can actually have a debate about this.\" A Maltese woman's abortion experience in UK \"The abortion hit on the train, after I left the clinic. I literally thought I was bleeding to death. I passed out from the pain on the train, alone.\" A Maltese woman in her mid-30s, Roberta became pregnant about 10 years ago when her boyfriend's condom split. She flew to a clinic in Birmingham, UK, where she paid \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3880) for pills to induce a medical abortion. \"When I got off the train and to my hotel, I thought I was dying. I thought something had gone wrong,\" says Roberta - not her real name. \"The hotel room looked like the scene of a murder. Blood on everything, projectile vomiting. Again, I'm completely on my own.\" When she returned to Malta, she bled for 40 days. Her \"very religious\" gynaecologist told her she had \"committed a crime\" and should be reported. Malta has a \"double effect\" law, allowing essential treatment of a sick mother with side effects that may harm the foetus - such as cancer therapy. But the foetus cannot be terminated just to save the mother. Deliberately terminating a pregnancy carries a prison sentence of up to three years. The morning-after pill only became legally available in Malta in December 2016 after a bitter battle that saw death threats made against those calling for the change. 'Holding society back' Lara Dimitrijevic is founder and director of the Women's Rights Foundation (WRF), which is calling for the decriminalisation of abortion in Malta. \"It's a breach of the fundamental human rights based on gender discrimination, because it's targeting women and girls,\" she says. WRF says that in the space of five years 465 women living in Malta tried to buy abortion pills online from a single source. And a local politician has claimed that 300-400 women go abroad for this procedure each year. \"This is holding Maltese society back,\" Ms Dimitrijevic said. \"It's holding women back specifically.\" The Church maintains a great deal of influence in a country that teaches abstinence as its only sexual education, she complains, adding that politicians are afraid to endorse abortion. She hopes the De-terminated play will be a \"softer way\" to discuss the issue.

Their lives are safeguarded in Maltese law,\" he says pointing to the \"double effect\" rules. \"It's the woman and the family's choice. Some women have accepted no treatment or to risk having it later, because they want the child to have a shot at life.\" When it comes to rape, Mr Vella Bardon says that while it is a \"horrible crime, why should the child be sacrificed?\" \"As a society we're against the death penalty, even for those who commit gratuitous murders, but why do we then accept killing a child?\" He also has tickets for De-terminated, which he expects to be a \"civil presentation of both points of view\". Despite Grech's efforts to provoke debate through staging a play, he does not expect to see abortion introduced within his lifetime. \"Women go to the UK for abortions and come back bleeding.

Another is based on a man who was sexually abused as a child, became promiscuous, later coerced his pregnant girlfriend into terminating their child, then found God, and now campaigns against abortion. Grech says he didn't write the play to campaign for either side. \"In Malta there are only ever two sides to choose from... everything's yes or no, there are no shades of grey,\" he says. \"Stop shouting at each other, and maybe we can actually have a debate about this.\" A Maltese woman's abortion experience in UK \"The abortion hit on the train, after I left the clinic.

She flew to a clinic in Birmingham, UK, where she paid \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3880) for pills to induce a medical abortion. \"When I got off the train and to my hotel, I thought I was dying. I thought something had gone wrong,\" says Roberta - not her real name. \"The hotel room looked like the scene of a murder. Blood on everything, projectile vomiting. Again, I'm completely on my own.\" When she returned to Malta, she bled for 40 days. Her \"very religious\" gynaecologist told her she had \"committed a crime\" and should be reported. Malta has a \"double effect\" law, allowing essential treatment of a sick mother with side effects that may harm the foetus - such as cancer therapy. But the foetus cannot be terminated just to save the mother. Deliberately terminating a pregnancy carries a prison sentence of up to three years.

With big money also being spent on other venues in the city, is Manchester on course to become a cultural powerhouse to rival London? By Ian YoungsArts reporter The large curved glass wedge that has appeared opposite the site of the old Hacienda nightclub, and which will later have its opening ceremony - led by London 2012 supremo Danny Boyle - is the latest evidence of a mini building boom in Manchester's cultural scene. The wedge - which contains two theatres, five cinemas, an art gallery - replaces the much-loved Cornerhouse cinema and gallery and Library Theatre, which have merged and been given an upgrade in the process. Home's launch comes three months after the Whitworth gallery reopened after a \u00a319m expansion, while there are also plans for another new \u00a378m venue called The Factory, less than a mile from Home. Austerity? What austerity? If it happens, The Factory will be a 5,000-capacity permanent home for the Manchester International Festival. These projects, taken with the city's existing activities, seem to have given Manchester optimism that its cultural future can be as bright as its illustrious past. At Home, chief executive Dave Moutrey is relishing having a custom-built venue to replace the Cornerhouse. He boasts that they now have ample toilets and enthuses about the outdoor cafe seating (weather permitting) and smoother layout. \"It's going to be quite a novel experience for our customers to be able to read the subtitles on a film without having to dodge somebody's head,\" he says. As well as improving the facilities, Home will provide more space to cater for what Moutrey describes as Manchester's \"hunger for new ideas\". The theatre, visual art and film offerings will all be roughly on the same wavelength - contemporary, intelligent, with a strong international flavour but with roots in Manchester. The opening line-up gives a taste of what to expect. Stockport playwright Simon Stephens - who put The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time on stage for the National Theatre - has adapted Hungarian writer Odon von Horvath's 1932 play Kasimir and Karoline and renamed it The Funfair. The play has also inspired the opening art exhibition, which features artists from Egypt, Iceland and Kosovo as well as Manchester. And there will be inventive screenings of funfair-themed films like Big, Carnival of Souls and Freaks. \"There is no superior art form here,\" Moutrey says. \"There's no art form that calls the shots over the others. They're all in dialogue with each other.\" Home may be a culture vulture's dream, but it was conceived by Manchester City Council in the hope that it would boost the economy by attracting other businesses to its part of the city centre. Now, Moutrey points out restaurants, a hotel and offices that he says would not have moved in if Home were not there. \"I think we're an example for how arts can be a catalyst for regeneration and people wanting to come and live and work in a city,\" he says. The tactic has already worked on one person - the organisation's new artistic director for film, Jason Wood, who has moved from Curzon Cinemas in London. Wood says he moved because the independent film scene in the capital was becoming \"quite stagnant\". \"I was looking at a lot of the activity that was going on in Manchester - just the funding, the excitement, and the notion of a city in a really good space culturally,\" he says. \"That was something that was really exciting and something I was happy to respond to. \"I really was beginning to feel that London was becoming the second city in terms of how it responded to film culture. I was finding it was becoming more and more difficult to get audiences to come.\" Home's artistic director of theatre, Walter Meierjohann, has also arrived from London, where he worked for three years at the in-form Young Vic. He is originally from Germany, where a more federal system exists, he explains. \"So the idea that in a country you can have five or six big cities... you can say Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Munich are all on an equal level culturally, which they are, [and that] is a good thing. \"I still think London will always be number one, but I think Manchester's on a really good journey.\" 'The new Barcelona' Other UK cities have also seen recent cultural developments - Birmingham has its library, Liverpool has the new Everyman theatre, and a new arts centre in Bangor, north Wales, will cost twice as much as Home. But still, the current expansion in Greater Manchester - coupled with its existing world-class venues - suggests it will have a critical mass of culture that other cities outside London cannot match. And on top of that, it is being positioned as the de facto capital of the fabled \"Northern Powerhouse\" that the last government was so keen to promote. Home's third artistic director is Sarah Perks, who is continuing the visual art work she did at Cornerhouse. There is no need to compare Manchester with London, she says. \"Manchester shouldn't look to become a mini-London or emulate London,\" she says. \"It's about becoming Manchester and being known for that, and looking acrossways and upwards. It doesn't always have to be this weird colonial relationship with London.\" Dave Moutrey echoes that, describing the city as an \"an alternative centre of gravity\" rather than a rival to the capital.

With big money also being spent on other venues in the city, is Manchester on course to become a cultural powerhouse to rival London? By Ian YoungsArts reporter The large curved glass wedge that has appeared opposite the site of the old Hacienda nightclub, and which will later have its opening ceremony - led by London 2012 supremo Danny Boyle - is the latest evidence of a mini building boom in Manchester's cultural scene. The wedge - which contains two theatres, five cinemas, an art gallery - replaces the much-loved Cornerhouse cinema and gallery and Library Theatre, which have merged and been given an upgrade in the process. Home's launch comes three months after the Whitworth gallery reopened after a \u00a319m expansion, while there are also plans for another new \u00a378m venue called The Factory, less than a mile from Home. Austerity? What austerity? If it happens, The Factory will be a 5,000-capacity permanent home for the Manchester International Festival. These projects, taken with the city's existing activities, seem to have given Manchester optimism that its cultural future can be as bright as its illustrious past. At Home, chief executive Dave Moutrey is relishing having a custom-built venue to replace the Cornerhouse. He boasts that they now have ample toilets and enthuses about the outdoor cafe seating (weather permitting) and smoother layout. \"It's going to be quite a novel experience for our customers to be able to read the subtitles on a film without having to dodge somebody's head,\" he says. As well as improving the facilities, Home will provide more space to cater for what Moutrey describes as Manchester's \"hunger for new ideas\". The theatre, visual art and film offerings will all be roughly on the same wavelength - contemporary, intelligent, with a strong international flavour but with roots in Manchester. The opening line-up gives a taste of what to expect. Stockport playwright Simon Stephens - who put The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time on stage for the National Theatre - has adapted Hungarian writer Odon von Horvath's 1932 play Kasimir and Karoline and renamed it The Funfair. The play has also inspired the opening art exhibition, which features artists from Egypt, Iceland and Kosovo as well as Manchester. And there will be inventive screenings of funfair-themed films like Big, Carnival of Souls and Freaks. \"There is no superior art form here,\" Moutrey says. \"There's no art form that calls the shots over the others. They're all in dialogue with each other.\" Home may be a culture vulture's dream, but it was conceived by Manchester City Council in the hope that it would boost the economy by attracting other businesses to its part of the city centre. Now, Moutrey points out restaurants, a hotel and offices that he says would not have moved in if Home were not there. \"I think we're an example for how arts can be a catalyst for regeneration and people wanting to come and live and work in a city,\" he says. The tactic has already worked on one person - the organisation's new artistic director for film, Jason Wood, who has moved from Curzon Cinemas in London. Wood says he moved because the independent film scene in the capital was becoming \"quite stagnant\". \"I was looking at a lot of the activity that was going on in Manchester - just the funding, the excitement, and the notion of a city in a really good space culturally,\" he says. \"That was something that was really exciting and something I was happy to respond to. \"I really was beginning to feel that London was becoming the second city in terms of how it responded to film culture.

I was finding it was becoming more and more difficult to get audiences to come.\" Home's artistic director of theatre, Walter Meierjohann, has also arrived from London, where he worked for three years at the in-form Young Vic. He is originally from Germany, where a more federal system exists, he explains. \"So the idea that in a country you can have five or six big cities... you can say Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Munich are all on an equal level culturally, which they are, [and that] is a good thing. \"I still think London will always be number one, but I think Manchester's on a really good journey.\" 'The new Barcelona' Other UK cities have also seen recent cultural developments - Birmingham has its library, Liverpool has the new Everyman theatre, and a new arts centre in Bangor, north Wales, will cost twice as much as Home. But still, the current expansion in Greater Manchester - coupled with its existing world-class venues - suggests it will have a critical mass of culture that other cities outside London cannot match. And on top of that, it is being positioned as the de facto capital of the fabled \"Northern Powerhouse\" that the last government was so keen to promote. Home's third artistic director is Sarah Perks, who is continuing the visual art work she did at Cornerhouse. There is no need to compare Manchester with London, she says. \"Manchester shouldn't look to become a mini-London or emulate London,\" she says. \"It's about becoming Manchester and being known for that, and looking acrossways and upwards. It doesn't always have to be this weird colonial relationship with London.\" Dave Moutrey echoes that, describing the city as an \"an alternative centre of gravity\" rather than a rival to the capital. He compares the relationship between Manchester and London with that of Barcelona and Madrid. \"If we continue to make great culture here I don't think it's too big a shock for people to start talking about Manchester in the same way as they talk about Barcelona,\" he says.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the opinion of Manchester City Council on the Home centre.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:\n\n# Output (a):\nManchester City Council conceived the Home centre with the hope that it would boost the economy by attracting other businesses to its part of the city centre. They believe that arts can be a catalyst for regeneration and encourage people to live and work in the city.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe Manchester City Council believes that the Home centre will be a boon to the city, attracting new businesses and boosting the economy.

They believe that arts can be a catalyst for regeneration and encourage people to live and work in the city. Therefore, Output (a) is better as it provides a more detailed explanation of the council's opinion on the Home centre.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nAfter evaluating the two outputs, I find that both Output (a) and Output (b) are equally accurate in summarizing the opinion of Manchester City Council on the Home centre. Both outputs convey that the council believes the Home centre will boost the economy and help Manchester become a cultural powerhouse, rivaling London.\n\nTherefore, neither Output (a) nor Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

With big money also being spent on other venues in the city, is Manchester on course to become a cultural powerhouse to rival London? By Ian YoungsArts reporter The large curved glass wedge that has appeared opposite the site of the old Hacienda nightclub, and which will later have its opening ceremony - led by London 2012 supremo Danny Boyle - is the latest evidence of a mini building boom in Manchester's cultural scene. The wedge - which contains two theatres, five cinemas, an art gallery - replaces the much-loved Cornerhouse cinema and gallery and Library Theatre, which have merged and been given an upgrade in the process. Home's launch comes three months after the Whitworth gallery reopened after a \u00a319m expansion, while there are also plans for another new \u00a378m venue called The Factory, less than a mile from Home. Austerity? What austerity? If it happens, The Factory will be a 5,000-capacity permanent home for the Manchester International Festival. These projects, taken with the city's existing activities, seem to have given Manchester optimism that its cultural future can be as bright as its illustrious past. At Home, chief executive Dave Moutrey is relishing having a custom-built venue to replace the Cornerhouse. He boasts that they now have ample toilets and enthuses about the outdoor cafe seating (weather permitting) and smoother layout. \"It's going to be quite a novel experience for our customers to be able to read the subtitles on a film without having to dodge somebody's head,\" he says. As well as improving the facilities, Home will provide more space to cater for what Moutrey describes as Manchester's \"hunger for new ideas\". The theatre, visual art and film offerings will all be roughly on the same wavelength - contemporary, intelligent, with a strong international flavour but with roots in Manchester. The opening line-up gives a taste of what to expect. Stockport playwright Simon Stephens - who put The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time on stage for the National Theatre - has adapted Hungarian writer Odon von Horvath's 1932 play Kasimir and Karoline and renamed it The Funfair. The play has also inspired the opening art exhibition, which features artists from Egypt, Iceland and Kosovo as well as Manchester. And there will be inventive screenings of funfair-themed films like Big, Carnival of Souls and Freaks. \"There is no superior art form here,\" Moutrey says. \"There's no art form that calls the shots over the others.

Now, Moutrey points out restaurants, a hotel and offices that he says would not have moved in if Home were not there. \"I think we're an example for how arts can be a catalyst for regeneration and people wanting to come and live and work in a city,\" he says. The tactic has already worked on one person - the organisation's new artistic director for film, Jason Wood, who has moved from Curzon Cinemas in London. Wood says he moved because the independent film scene in the capital was becoming \"quite stagnant\". \"I was looking at a lot of the activity that was going on in Manchester - just the funding, the excitement, and the notion of a city in a really good space culturally,\" he says. \"That was something that was really exciting and something I was happy to respond to. \"I really was beginning to feel that London was becoming the second city in terms of how it responded to film culture. I was finding it was becoming more and more difficult to get audiences to come.\" Home's artistic director of theatre, Walter Meierjohann, has also arrived from London, where he worked for three years at the in-form Young Vic. He is originally from Germany, where a more federal system exists, he explains. \"So the idea that in a country you can have five or six big cities... you can say Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Munich are all on an equal level culturally, which they are, [and that] is a good thing. \"I still think London will always be number one, but I think Manchester's on a really good journey.\" 'The new Barcelona' Other UK cities have also seen recent cultural developments - Birmingham has its library, Liverpool has the new Everyman theatre, and a new arts centre in Bangor, north Wales, will cost twice as much as Home. But still, the current expansion in Greater Manchester - coupled with its existing world-class venues - suggests it will have a critical mass of culture that other cities outside London cannot match. And on top of that, it is being positioned as the de facto capital of the fabled \"Northern Powerhouse\" that the last government was so keen to promote. Home's third artistic director is Sarah Perks, who is continuing the visual art work she did at Cornerhouse. There is no need to compare Manchester with London, she says. \"Manchester shouldn't look to become a mini-London or emulate London,\" she says. \"It's about becoming Manchester and being known for that, and looking acrossways and upwards.

With big money also being spent on other venues in the city, is Manchester on course to become a cultural powerhouse to rival London? By Ian YoungsArts reporter The large curved glass wedge that has appeared opposite the site of the old Hacienda nightclub, and which will later have its opening ceremony - led by London 2012 supremo Danny Boyle - is the latest evidence of a mini building boom in Manchester's cultural scene. The wedge - which contains two theatres, five cinemas, an art gallery - replaces the much-loved Cornerhouse cinema and gallery and Library Theatre, which have merged and been given an upgrade in the process. Home's launch comes three months after the Whitworth gallery reopened after a \u00a319m expansion, while there are also plans for another new \u00a378m venue called The Factory, less than a mile from Home. Austerity? What austerity? If it happens, The Factory will be a 5,000-capacity permanent home for the Manchester International Festival. These projects, taken with the city's existing activities, seem to have given Manchester optimism that its cultural future can be as bright as its illustrious past. At Home, chief executive Dave Moutrey is relishing having a custom-built venue to replace the Cornerhouse. He boasts that they now have ample toilets and enthuses about the outdoor cafe seating (weather permitting) and smoother layout. \"It's going to be quite a novel experience for our customers to be able to read the subtitles on a film without having to dodge somebody's head,\" he says. As well as improving the facilities, Home will provide more space to cater for what Moutrey describes as Manchester's \"hunger for new ideas\". The theatre, visual art and film offerings will all be roughly on the same wavelength - contemporary, intelligent, with a strong international flavour but with roots in Manchester. The opening line-up gives a taste of what to expect. Stockport playwright Simon Stephens - who put The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time on stage for the National Theatre - has adapted Hungarian writer Odon von Horvath's 1932 play Kasimir and Karoline and renamed it The Funfair. The play has also inspired the opening art exhibition, which features artists from Egypt, Iceland and Kosovo as well as Manchester. And there will be inventive screenings of funfair-themed films like Big, Carnival of Souls and Freaks. \"There is no superior art form here,\" Moutrey says. \"There's no art form that calls the shots over the others. They're all in dialogue with each other.\" Home may be a culture vulture's dream, but it was conceived by Manchester City Council in the hope that it would boost the economy by attracting other businesses to its part of the city centre. Now, Moutrey points out restaurants, a hotel and offices that he says would not have moved in if Home were not there. \"I think we're an example for how arts can be a catalyst for regeneration and people wanting to come and live and work in a city,\" he says. The tactic has already worked on one person - the organisation's new artistic director for film, Jason Wood, who has moved from Curzon Cinemas in London. Wood says he moved because the independent film scene in the capital was becoming \"quite stagnant\". \"I was looking at a lot of the activity that was going on in Manchester - just the funding, the excitement, and the notion of a city in a really good space culturally,\" he says. \"That was something that was really exciting and something I was happy to respond to. \"I really was beginning to feel that London was becoming the second city in terms of how it responded to film culture. I was finding it was becoming more and more difficult to get audiences to come.\" Home's artistic director of theatre, Walter Meierjohann, has also arrived from London, where he worked for three years at the in-form Young Vic. He is originally from Germany, where a more federal system exists, he explains. \"So the idea that in a country you can have five or six big cities... you can say Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Munich are all on an equal level culturally, which they are, [and that] is a good thing. \"I still think London will always be number one, but I think Manchester's on a really good journey.\" 'The new Barcelona' Other UK cities have also seen recent cultural developments - Birmingham has its library, Liverpool has the new Everyman theatre, and a new arts centre in Bangor, north Wales, will cost twice as much as Home. But still, the current expansion in Greater Manchester - coupled with its existing world-class venues - suggests it will have a critical mass of culture that other cities outside London cannot match. And on top of that, it is being positioned as the de facto capital of the fabled \"Northern Powerhouse\" that the last government was so keen to promote. Home's third artistic director is Sarah Perks, who is continuing the visual art work she did at Cornerhouse.

With big money also being spent on other venues in the city, is Manchester on course to become a cultural powerhouse to rival London? By Ian YoungsArts reporter The large curved glass wedge that has appeared opposite the site of the old Hacienda nightclub, and which will later have its opening ceremony - led by London 2012 supremo Danny Boyle - is the latest evidence of a mini building boom in Manchester's cultural scene. The wedge - which contains two theatres, five cinemas, an art gallery - replaces the much-loved Cornerhouse cinema and gallery and Library Theatre, which have merged and been given an upgrade in the process. Home's launch comes three months after the Whitworth gallery reopened after a \u00a319m expansion, while there are also plans for another new \u00a378m venue called The Factory, less than a mile from Home. Austerity? What austerity? If it happens, The Factory will be a 5,000-capacity permanent home for the Manchester International Festival. These projects, taken with the city's existing activities, seem to have given Manchester optimism that its cultural future can be as bright as its illustrious past. At Home, chief executive Dave Moutrey is relishing having a custom-built venue to replace the Cornerhouse. He boasts that they now have ample toilets and enthuses about the outdoor cafe seating (weather permitting) and smoother layout. \"It's going to be quite a novel experience for our customers to be able to read the subtitles on a film without having to dodge somebody's head,\" he says. As well as improving the facilities, Home will provide more space to cater for what Moutrey describes as Manchester's \"hunger for new ideas\". The theatre, visual art and film offerings will all be roughly on the same wavelength - contemporary, intelligent, with a strong international flavour but with roots in Manchester.

Stockport playwright Simon Stephens - who put The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time on stage for the National Theatre - has adapted Hungarian writer Odon von Horvath's 1932 play Kasimir and Karoline and renamed it The Funfair.

Wood says he moved because the independent film scene in the capital was becoming \"quite stagnant\". \"I was looking at a lot of the activity that was going on in Manchester - just the funding, the excitement, and the notion of a city in a really good space culturally,\" he says. \"That was something that was really exciting and something I was happy to respond to. \"I really was beginning to feel that London was becoming the second city in terms of how it responded to film culture.

He boasts that they now have ample toilets and enthuses about the outdoor cafe seating (weather permitting) and smoother layout. \"It's going to be quite a novel experience for our customers to be able to read the subtitles on a film without having to dodge somebody's head,\" he says. As well as improving the facilities, Home will provide more space to cater for what Moutrey describes as Manchester's \"hunger for new ideas\". The theatre, visual art and film offerings will all be roughly on the same wavelength - contemporary, intelligent, with a strong international flavour but with roots in Manchester. The opening line-up gives a taste of what to expect. Stockport playwright Simon Stephens - who put The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time on stage for the National Theatre - has adapted Hungarian writer Odon von Horvath's 1932 play Kasimir and Karoline and renamed it The Funfair. The play has also inspired the opening art exhibition, which features artists from Egypt, Iceland and Kosovo as well as Manchester. And there will be inventive screenings of funfair-themed films like Big, Carnival of Souls and Freaks. \"There is no superior art form here,\" Moutrey says. \"There's no art form that calls the shots over the others. They're all in dialogue with each other.\" Home may be a culture vulture's dream, but it was conceived by Manchester City Council in the hope that it would boost the economy by attracting other businesses to its part of the city centre. Now, Moutrey points out restaurants, a hotel and offices that he says would not have moved in if Home were not there. \"I think we're an example for how arts can be a catalyst for regeneration and people wanting to come and live and work in a city,\" he says. The tactic has already worked on one person - the organisation's new artistic director for film, Jason Wood, who has moved from Curzon Cinemas in London. Wood says he moved because the independent film scene in the capital was becoming \"quite stagnant\". \"I was looking at a lot of the activity that was going on in Manchester - just the funding, the excitement, and the notion of a city in a really good space culturally,\" he says. \"That was something that was really exciting and something I was happy to respond to. \"I really was beginning to feel that London was becoming the second city in terms of how it responded to film culture. I was finding it was becoming more and more difficult to get audiences to come.\" Home's artistic director of theatre, Walter Meierjohann, has also arrived from London, where he worked for three years at the in-form Young Vic. He is originally from Germany, where a more federal system exists, he explains. \"So the idea that in a country you can have five or six big cities... you can say Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Munich are all on an equal level culturally, which they are, [and that] is a good thing. \"I still think London will always be number one, but I think Manchester's on a really good journey.\" 'The new Barcelona' Other UK cities have also seen recent cultural developments - Birmingham has its library, Liverpool has the new Everyman theatre, and a new arts centre in Bangor, north Wales, will cost twice as much as Home.

By Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent More than 40,000 parents have signed a petition calling for a boycott of primary school tests, which are due to be taken later this month. Parents supporting the Let Our Kids Be Kids campaign have complained of a damaging culture of over-testing. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan says taking pupils out of school \"even for a day is harmful to their education\". It remains uncertain how many primary school children were kept off school across the country, but a social media campaign had urged parents to take children on educational activities for the day. About 500 people gathered at Preston Park in Brighton, including children's laureate Chris Riddell. \"We should be turning children into readers with the pleasure that gives, rather than relying on a testing culture,\" said Mr Riddell. Parents have handed in the petition at the headquarters of the Department for Education in London. Among the parents present was Caterina, with son and daughter in Ivydale school in Nunhead, south London. The campaign organisers say children are \"over-tested, over-worked and in a school system that places more importance on test results and league tables than children's happiness and joy of learning\". They have raised concerns about the impact of primary tests, so-called Sats tests, taken by seven-year-olds and 11-year-olds, which are being made more stretching with changes to the curriculum. They have challenged what they claim is a \"dull, dry curriculum\" based around tests. In an open letter to the education secretary, campaigners have warned of schools becoming \"exam factories\" and that testing causes stress and can make young children feel like \"failures\". Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw rejected these arguments, saying that improving social mobility depended on making sure that children are not falling behind at any early age. \"The government is right to introduce greater structure and rigour into the assessment process. Those who oppose this testing need to consider England's mediocre position in the OECD education rankings,\" said Sir Michael. \"As I have long argued, children who fall behind in the early years of their education struggle to catch up in later years.\" Education Minister Nick Gibb said tests improved standards and need not be stressful. \"Schools should not be putting pressure on young people when taking these assessments. \"I've been to many schools where the children don't even know they're taking the tests,\" said Mr Gibb. The importance of testing was emphasised by Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education. He said that any short-term stress was worth it if in the longer term it meant that children finished school with better results. Schools minister Nick Gibb was asked a question on BBC Radio 4's World at One from a grammar test for 11 year olds Martha Kearney: Let me give you this sentence: \"I went to the cinema, after I'd eaten my dinner.\" Is the word \"after\" there being used as a subordinating conjunction or a preposition? Nick Gibb: Well it's a preposition. Martha Kearney: I don't think it is. Nick Gibb: \"After\" is a preposition. It can be used in some contexts as a word that coordinates a sub-clause, but this isn't about me. Martha Kearney: But I think in this sentence it's being used as a subordinating conjunction. Nick Gibb: Fine, well this isn't about me, this is about ensuring that future generations of children - unlike me incidentally, who was not taught grammar at primary school... Martha Kearney: Perhaps not. Nick Gibb: ...We need to make sure that future generations of children are taught grammar properly.\" Mr McGovern said that tests in England's schools needed to be tougher to catch up with international competitors. \"We're three years behind the Chinese at the age of 15. We are a bit of a basket case internationally. \"We've got to do something, we've got to act early, and a health check at seven is a good idea.\" Ministers have already had problems with the administration of primary school tests this year. The baseline tests, which were intended to be a benchmark for measuring progress, were found to have unreliable results and have been postponed. Tests for seven-year-olds in spelling, punctuation and grammar also had to be called off when it was found that test questions had mistakenly been published on a Department for Education website. Labour's shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said she did not \"condone children being taken out of school\". But she accused the government of \"creating chaos and confusion in primary assessment\". Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"I think the gap between the profession and the government has never been wider than it is at the moment.\" He warned of \"an enormous number of mistakes, delays and confusions around testing\". But Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has argued that raising standards will improve creativity and not restrict it. \"How creative can a child be if they struggle to understand the words on the page in front of them?\" Mrs Morgan told head teachers at the weekend. \"That is why the campaign led by some of those who do not think we should set high expectations, who want to keep their children home for a day is so damaging. \"Keeping children home, even for a day is harmful to their education.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize what people have done to protest about primary tests in England.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "Parents have kept their children out of school to protest against primary tests in England.

By Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent More than 40,000 parents have signed a petition calling for a boycott of primary school tests, which are due to be taken later this month. Parents supporting the Let Our Kids Be Kids campaign have complained of a damaging culture of over-testing. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan says taking pupils out of school \"even for a day is harmful to their education\". It remains uncertain how many primary school children were kept off school across the country, but a social media campaign had urged parents to take children on educational activities for the day. About 500 people gathered at Preston Park in Brighton, including children's laureate Chris Riddell. \"We should be turning children into readers with the pleasure that gives, rather than relying on a testing culture,\" said Mr Riddell. Parents have handed in the petition at the headquarters of the Department for Education in London. Among the parents present was Caterina, with son and daughter in Ivydale school in Nunhead, south London. The campaign organisers say children are \"over-tested, over-worked and in a school system that places more importance on test results and league tables than children's happiness and joy of learning\". They have raised concerns about the impact of primary tests, so-called Sats tests, taken by seven-year-olds and 11-year-olds, which are being made more stretching with changes to the curriculum. They have challenged what they claim is a \"dull, dry curriculum\" based around tests. In an open letter to the education secretary, campaigners have warned of schools becoming \"exam factories\" and that testing causes stress and can make young children feel like \"failures\". Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw rejected these arguments, saying that improving social mobility depended on making sure that children are not falling behind at any early age. \"The government is right to introduce greater structure and rigour into the assessment process. Those who oppose this testing need to consider England's mediocre position in the OECD education rankings,\" said Sir Michael. \"As I have long argued, children who fall behind in the early years of their education struggle to catch up in later years.\" Education Minister Nick Gibb said tests improved standards and need not be stressful. \"Schools should not be putting pressure on young people when taking these assessments. \"I've been to many schools where the children don't even know they're taking the tests,\" said Mr Gibb.

He said that any short-term stress was worth it if in the longer term it meant that children finished school with better results. Schools minister Nick Gibb was asked a question on BBC Radio 4's World at One from a grammar test for 11 year olds Martha Kearney: Let me give you this sentence: \"I went to the cinema, after I'd eaten my dinner.\" Is the word \"after\" there being used as a subordinating conjunction or a preposition? Nick Gibb: Well it's a preposition. Martha Kearney: I don't think it is. Nick Gibb: \"After\" is a preposition. It can be used in some contexts as a word that coordinates a sub-clause, but this isn't about me. Martha Kearney: But I think in this sentence it's being used as a subordinating conjunction. Nick Gibb: Fine, well this isn't about me, this is about ensuring that future generations of children - unlike me incidentally, who was not taught grammar at primary school... Martha Kearney: Perhaps not. Nick Gibb: ...We need to make sure that future generations of children are taught grammar properly.\" Mr McGovern said that tests in England's schools needed to be tougher to catch up with international competitors. \"We're three years behind the Chinese at the age of 15.

By Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent More than 40,000 parents have signed a petition calling for a boycott of primary school tests, which are due to be taken later this month. Parents supporting the Let Our Kids Be Kids campaign have complained of a damaging culture of over-testing. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan says taking pupils out of school \"even for a day is harmful to their education\". It remains uncertain how many primary school children were kept off school across the country, but a social media campaign had urged parents to take children on educational activities for the day. About 500 people gathered at Preston Park in Brighton, including children's laureate Chris Riddell. \"We should be turning children into readers with the pleasure that gives, rather than relying on a testing culture,\" said Mr Riddell. Parents have handed in the petition at the headquarters of the Department for Education in London. Among the parents present was Caterina, with son and daughter in Ivydale school in Nunhead, south London. The campaign organisers say children are \"over-tested, over-worked and in a school system that places more importance on test results and league tables than children's happiness and joy of learning\". They have raised concerns about the impact of primary tests, so-called Sats tests, taken by seven-year-olds and 11-year-olds, which are being made more stretching with changes to the curriculum. They have challenged what they claim is a \"dull, dry curriculum\" based around tests. In an open letter to the education secretary, campaigners have warned of schools becoming \"exam factories\" and that testing causes stress and can make young children feel like \"failures\".

But no-one can agree on the best way to make them. Who will win the race? By Mary-Ann RussonTechnology of Business reporter Superfast quantum computers could speed up the discovery of new medicines, crack the most complex cryptographic security systems, design new materials, model climate change, and supercharge artificial intelligence, computer scientists say. But there's currently no consensus on the best way to make them or how to make them available to the mass market. Physicists, engineers and computer scientists around the world are trying to develop four very different types of quantum computers, based around light particles, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, or nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamonds. Companies like IBM, Google, Rigetti, Intel and Microsoft are currently leading the quantum charge. Each method has its pros and cons, but the overarching challenge is the fragile nature of quantum itself. What is quantum computing? Instead of using ones and noughts called bits, representing on or off, in long sequences as in classical computing a quantum bit - or qubit - uses the near magical properties of sub-atomic particles. Electrons or photons, for example, can be in two states at the same time - a phenomenon called superposition. As a result, a qubit-based computer can do far more calculations much faster than a conventional computer. \"If you had a two-qubit computer and you add two qubits, it becomes a four-qubit computer. But you're not doubling the computer power, you're increasing it exponentially,\" explains Martin Giles, San Francisco bureau chief of the MIT Technology Review. Computer scientists sometimes describe this quantum computing effect as like being able to go down each path of a very complex maze at the same time. Qubits can also influence each other even when they're not physically connected, a process called \"entanglement\". In computing terms, this gives them the ability to make logical leaps conventional computers never could. The search for stability But qubits are highly unstable and prone to interference or \"noise\" from other sources of energy, leading to errors in calculations. So the race is one to find a way to stabilise them for mass-production. Computing giant IBM firmly believes that \"transmon superconducting qubits\" hold the most promise for quantum computing, and they have three prototype quantum processors that the public can access in the cloud. \"So far, over 94,000 people have accessed IBM quantum computers in the cloud. They've run over five million experiments and written 110 papers,\" says Dr Robert Sutor, vice president for quantum computing strategy and ecosystem at IBM Research. \"People are learning and experimenting... we hope in three to five years to be able to point at one specific example, and say that quantum significantly improves on anything classical computers can do.\" But IBM's method required the quantum computer to be stored within a large fridge, where the qubits are stored at temperatures close to absolute zero to ensure that they remain in their useful states. This means it would be extremely hard to miniaturise, and thus very expensive. \"It seems likely that superconducting qubits will be among the first technologies to enable useful quantum computation,\" says Joseph Fitzsimons, a principal investigator at the National University of Singapore's Centre of Quantum Technologies. \"However, my impression is that they are analogous to vacuum tubes in early computers, rather than transistors which came along later. \"We may yet see another technology emerge which becomes the ultimate winner.\" Microsoft and academics at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen are working on what they believe will be much more stable qubits based on so-called Majorana particles. While other teams are working on trapping qubits in silicon - the material traditional computer chips have been made from. And computer scientists at Oxford University are looking at ways to link smaller qubit computers rather than creating bigger computers with lots of qubits. There are many ways to skin Schrodinger's Cat it seems. Classical potential? While we wait for quantum computers, what's the future for conventional, or classical, computing? In July, Ewin Tang, an 18-year-old graduate in computer science and mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin, made waves in the international computing world by developing a classical computer algorithm that can solve a problem almost as fast as a quantum computer. The problem involved developing a recommendation engine that suggests products to users based on data about their preferences. And the EU recently announced it is working on the next generation of computers - exascale - which would enable a billion billion calculations per second. \"Exascale means 10 to the power of 18 operations per second,\" explains says Prof Scott Aaronson, a theoretical computer scientist at UT Austin who mentored Mr Tang. \"10 to the power of 18 is big, but quantum systems, which will be capable of 10 to the power of 1,000 operations per second, is much, much bigger.\" And the problem for classical computing is that we are reaching the limits of how many transistors we can fit onto a chip - Apple's A11 squeezes in an astonishing 4.3 billion, for example.

But no-one can agree on the best way to make them. Who will win the race? By Mary-Ann RussonTechnology of Business reporter Superfast quantum computers could speed up the discovery of new medicines, crack the most complex cryptographic security systems, design new materials, model climate change, and supercharge artificial intelligence, computer scientists say. But there's currently no consensus on the best way to make them or how to make them available to the mass market. Physicists, engineers and computer scientists around the world are trying to develop four very different types of quantum computers, based around light particles, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, or nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamonds. Companies like IBM, Google, Rigetti, Intel and Microsoft are currently leading the quantum charge. Each method has its pros and cons, but the overarching challenge is the fragile nature of quantum itself. What is quantum computing? Instead of using ones and noughts called bits, representing on or off, in long sequences as in classical computing a quantum bit - or qubit - uses the near magical properties of sub-atomic particles. Electrons or photons, for example, can be in two states at the same time - a phenomenon called superposition. As a result, a qubit-based computer can do far more calculations much faster than a conventional computer. \"If you had a two-qubit computer and you add two qubits, it becomes a four-qubit computer. But you're not doubling the computer power, you're increasing it exponentially,\" explains Martin Giles, San Francisco bureau chief of the MIT Technology Review. Computer scientists sometimes describe this quantum computing effect as like being able to go down each path of a very complex maze at the same time. Qubits can also influence each other even when they're not physically connected, a process called \"entanglement\". In computing terms, this gives them the ability to make logical leaps conventional computers never could. The search for stability But qubits are highly unstable and prone to interference or \"noise\" from other sources of energy, leading to errors in calculations. So the race is one to find a way to stabilise them for mass-production. Computing giant IBM firmly believes that \"transmon superconducting qubits\" hold the most promise for quantum computing, and they have three prototype quantum processors that the public can access in the cloud. \"So far, over 94,000 people have accessed IBM quantum computers in the cloud. They've run over five million experiments and written 110 papers,\" says Dr Robert Sutor, vice president for quantum computing strategy and ecosystem at IBM Research. \"People are learning and experimenting... we hope in three to five years to be able to point at one specific example, and say that quantum significantly improves on anything classical computers can do.\" But IBM's method required the quantum computer to be stored within a large fridge, where the qubits are stored at temperatures close to absolute zero to ensure that they remain in their useful states. This means it would be extremely hard to miniaturise, and thus very expensive. \"It seems likely that superconducting qubits will be among the first technologies to enable useful quantum computation,\" says Joseph Fitzsimons, a principal investigator at the National University of Singapore's Centre of Quantum Technologies. \"However, my impression is that they are analogous to vacuum tubes in early computers, rather than transistors which came along later. \"We may yet see another technology emerge which becomes the ultimate winner.\" Microsoft and academics at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen are working on what they believe will be much more stable qubits based on so-called Majorana particles. While other teams are working on trapping qubits in silicon - the material traditional computer chips have been made from. And computer scientists at Oxford University are looking at ways to link smaller qubit computers rather than creating bigger computers with lots of qubits. There are many ways to skin Schrodinger's Cat it seems. Classical potential? While we wait for quantum computers, what's the future for conventional, or classical, computing? In July, Ewin Tang, an 18-year-old graduate in computer science and mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin, made waves in the international computing world by developing a classical computer algorithm that can solve a problem almost as fast as a quantum computer.

Regarded as one of Britain's greatest living composers, he talks about how the possibility of \"sudden death at any time\" has changed his music, his outlook and his faith. By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News When Sir John Tavener suffered a heart attack in Switzerland in December 2007, he had emergency bypass surgery and spent four months in intensive care. \"They didn't know whether my brain had been damaged,\" he says. \"My wife had flown over, and she played me Mozart. And I apparently, in my unconscious state, began conducting. So that brought me round again.\" The power of music came to Sir John's aid in his hospital bed. That music should connect with something deep within him is perhaps not so far-fetched given his lifelong devotion to harnessing the power of music himself. The composer has achieved a popularity that is rare in the classical world with choral works that are marked out by their pared-down beauty and intense spirituality. Music has always been sacred to Sir John, who converted to the Orthodox church in 1977 and has said that \"my way towards God has been to write music\". In 1992, The Protecting Veil, for solo cello and strings, topped the classical charts for several months. In 1997, Sir John's Song For Athene was played as the coffin of Princess Diana was carried out of Westminster Abbey during her funeral. And his A New Beginning was chosen to see in the new century at the end of 1999 in the Millennium Dome in London. Now he is premiering three new works, all written after his heart attack, at the Manchester International Festival. \"Nobody in the hospital thought I'd get this far,\" the 69-year-old says. \"They didn't think I'd write again.\" The new works include one based on a \"rather terrifying\" short story by Leo Tolstoy, The Death of Ivan Ilyich, in which the central character seeks redemption as he stares into the void of death. \"That was one of the first pieces I wrote after I'd been ill,\" Sir John says. \"And in a way there is a sort of autobiographical slant to it, although I've ritualised it very much. \"It's an extraordinary study of physical agony. He's reviewing his miserable life and then attaining a kind of half peace just at the end.\" Another new work, The Love Duet, is \"some of the most ecstatic music that I've ever written\", he says, taken from what the composer describes as a pantomime about the life of the Hindu deity Krishna. The third, If Ye Love Me, will be performed by the festival's Sacred Sounds Women's Choir, which draws members from six faiths in the city. \"I was very happy to do it because I think actually all religions have reached a stage of maturity, therefore decay, and, up to a point, senility,\" Sir John says. \"Therefore to get back to the basis of them is something very exciting to be able to do.\" Since the start of the 2000s, Sir John has been open to inspiration from other faiths and has looked beyond his Christian devotion to Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism and Native American beliefs. \"I always go back to what Plato said, that Heaven and Earth were once joined and there was one single primordial being, God,\" he says. \"And one understands from that, that all religions are equally true, or equally false, I suppose you could say, depending on your perspective. \"I think there will always be a possibility that God doesn't exist because He is infinitude and into that infinitude must come that possibility.\" During his most recent illness, he has \"had a lot of time to think about what I really feel about these things\", Sir John says. \"I suppose it's grown me up spiritually.\" Does the suggestion that God may not exist reflect a crisis of faith? \"When I became ill in Switzerland and I became conscious for the first time, the religious zeal that I had before, I found had gone,\" he replies. \"But so had my ability to write music. It was about three years without doing anything, I just wanted to lie in a darkened room.

He had a stroke in 1979, and in 1990 was diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome, a hereditary condition that can cause heart defects. He had heart surgery the following year. These days, composing is a welcome distraction from constant abdominal pain, he says, although he cannot work for more than two hours a day without becoming exhausted. He claims that, \"deep down\", he is grateful that his health problems have given him more time to listen to other music and made him a \"more sensitive and more caring\" person. \"I'm much closer to my family than I've ever been,\" he says. \"I give more time to them. I live through them more. And I feel I only want to write if I feel there's something urgent I have to say. \"The music's become more condensed, I'd say. More terse. I tended to write works that lasted, like seven hours with The Veil of the Temple [in 2003]. But now I would say nothing I write is over 20 minutes.\" Despite the physical impediments, is he trying to write as much as he can while he can? \"I've always been aware of mortality because I've always had ill health most of my life,\" he replies. \"But I suppose much more now because the cardiologist always says to me, 'Sudden death at any time.' \"He's not very cheerful,\" Sir John adds with a chuckle. \"He's a dour Scot.

The third, If Ye Love Me, will be performed by the festival's Sacred Sounds Women's Choir, which draws members from six faiths in the city. \"I was very happy to do it because I think actually all religions have reached a stage of maturity, therefore decay, and, up to a point, senility,\" Sir John says. \"Therefore to get back to the basis of them is something very exciting to be able to do.\" Since the start of the 2000s, Sir John has been open to inspiration from other faiths and has looked beyond his Christian devotion to Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism and Native American beliefs. \"I always go back to what Plato said, that Heaven and Earth were once joined and there was one single primordial being, God,\" he says. \"And one understands from that, that all religions are equally true, or equally false, I suppose you could say, depending on your perspective. \"I think there will always be a possibility that God doesn't exist because He is infinitude and into that infinitude must come that possibility.\" During his most recent illness, he has \"had a lot of time to think about what I really feel about these things\", Sir John says. \"I suppose it's grown me up spiritually.\" Does the suggestion that God may not exist reflect a crisis of faith? \"When I became ill in Switzerland and I became conscious for the first time, the religious zeal that I had before, I found had gone,\" he replies. \"But so had my ability to write music. It was about three years without doing anything, I just wanted to lie in a darkened room. And the faith came back in a different way, with writing. \"I think I've been very lucky all my life because the writing and the faith seem to go together.\" Sir John has suffered ill health for much of his life. He had a stroke in 1979, and in 1990 was diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome, a hereditary condition that can cause heart defects. He had heart surgery the following year. These days, composing is a welcome distraction from constant abdominal pain, he says, although he cannot work for more than two hours a day without becoming exhausted. He claims that, \"deep down\", he is grateful that his health problems have given him more time to listen to other music and made him a \"more sensitive and more caring\" person. \"I'm much closer to my family than I've ever been,\" he says. \"I give more time to them. I live through them more. And I feel I only want to write if I feel there's something urgent I have to say. \"The music's become more condensed, I'd say. More terse. I tended to write works that lasted, like seven hours with The Veil of the Temple [in 2003]. But now I would say nothing I write is over 20 minutes.\" Despite the physical impediments, is he trying to write as much as he can while he can? \"I've always been aware of mortality because I've always had ill health most of my life,\" he replies. \"But I suppose much more now because the cardiologist always says to me, 'Sudden death at any time.' \"He's not very cheerful,\" Sir John adds with a chuckle. \"He's a dour Scot.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nSir John Tavener defied doctors' expectations when he resumed composing after a heart attack. Regarded as one of Britain's greatest living composers, he talks about how the possibility of \"sudden death at any time\" has changed his music, his outlook and his faith. By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News When Sir John Tavener suffered a heart attack in Switzerland in December 2007, he had emergency bypass surgery and spent four months in intensive care. \"They didn't know whether my brain had been damaged,\" he says. \"My wife had flown over, and she played me Mozart. And I apparently, in my unconscious state, began conducting. So that brought me round again.\" The power of music came to Sir John's aid in his hospital bed. That music should connect with something deep within him is perhaps not so far-fetched given his lifelong devotion to harnessing the power of music himself. The composer has achieved a popularity that is rare in the classical world with choral works that are marked out by their pared-down beauty and intense spirituality. Music has always been sacred to Sir John, who converted to the Orthodox church in 1977 and has said that \"my way towards God has been to write music\". In 1992, The Protecting Veil, for solo cello and strings, topped the classical charts for several months. In 1997, Sir John's Song For Athene was played as the coffin of Princess Diana was carried out of Westminster Abbey during her funeral. And his A New Beginning was chosen to see in the new century at the end of 1999 in the Millennium Dome in London. Now he is premiering three new works, all written after his heart attack, at the Manchester International Festival. \"Nobody in the hospital thought I'd get this far,\" the 69-year-old says. \"They didn't think I'd write again.\" The new works include one based on a \"rather terrifying\" short story by Leo Tolstoy, The Death of Ivan Ilyich, in which the central character seeks redemption as he stares into the void of death. \"That was one of the first pieces I wrote after I'd been ill,\" Sir John says. \"And in a way there is a sort of autobiographical slant to it, although I've ritualised it very much. \"It's an extraordinary study of physical agony. He's reviewing his miserable life and then attaining a kind of half peace just at the end.\" Another new work, The Love Duet, is \"some of the most ecstatic music that I've ever written\", he says, taken from what the composer describes as a pantomime about the life of the Hindu deity Krishna. The third, If Ye Love Me, will be performed by the festival's Sacred Sounds Women's Choir, which draws members from six faiths in the city. \"I was very happy to do it because I think actually all religions have reached a stage of maturity, therefore decay, and, up to a point, senility,\" Sir John says. \"Therefore to get back to the basis of them is something very exciting to be able to do.\" Since the start of the 2000s, Sir John has been open to inspiration from other faiths and has looked beyond his Christian devotion to Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism and Native American beliefs. \"I always go back to what Plato said, that Heaven and Earth were once joined and there was one single primordial being, God,\" he says. \"And one understands from that, that all religions are equally true, or equally false, I suppose you could say, depending on your perspective. \"I think there will always be a possibility that God doesn't exist because He is infinitude and into that infinitude must come that possibility.\" During his most recent illness, he has \"had a lot of time to think about what I really feel about these things\", Sir John says. \"I suppose it's grown me up spiritually.\" Does the suggestion that God may not exist reflect a crisis of faith? \"When I became ill in Switzerland and I became conscious for the first time, the religious zeal that I had before, I found had gone,\" he replies. \"But so had my ability to write music. It was about three years without doing anything, I just wanted to lie in a darkened room. And the faith came back in a different way, with writing. \"I think I've been very lucky all my life because the writing and the faith seem to go together.\" Sir John has suffered ill health for much of his life. He had a stroke in 1979, and in 1990 was diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome, a hereditary condition that can cause heart defects. He had heart surgery the following year. These days, composing is a welcome distraction from constant abdominal pain, he says, although he cannot work for more than two hours a day without becoming exhausted. He claims that, \"deep down\", he is grateful that his health problems have given him more time to listen to other music and made him a \"more sensitive and more caring\" person. \"I'm much closer to my family than I've ever been,\" he says. \"I give more time to them. I live through them more. And I feel I only want to write if I feel there's something urgent I have to say. \"The music's become more condensed, I'd say. More terse. I tended to write works that lasted, like seven hours with The Veil of the Temple [in 2003]. But now I would say nothing I write is over 20 minutes.\" Despite the physical impediments, is he trying to write as much as he can while he can? \"I've always been aware of mortality because I've always had ill health most of my life,\" he replies. \"But I suppose much more now because the cardiologist always says to me, 'Sudden death at any time.' \"He's not very cheerful,\" Sir John adds with a chuckle. \"He's a dour Scot. I think he has to cover himself. \"Yes, I'm obviously living with that possibility all the time.\" The concert of Sir John Tavener's music is at the Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, on 7 July.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the significance of music in Sir John Tavener's life and spiritual journey.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "Sir John Tavener, one of Britain's greatest living composers, has always considered music sacred and a way towards God.

But, as he tells the BBC, there's more to the blues than singing about being miserable. By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter Sir Lenny Henry has little left to prove. He's a successful comedian, a respected stage actor and a well-known campaigner for racial diversity in the entertainment industry. He was knighted last year and will receive a special Bafta at this Sunday's TV awards ceremony. So why has he decided to venture into the music industry and become a blues singer? \"Because I've been making music and singing and performing since I was 16 and I've always wanted to make an album,\" he explains. \"I've always loved the blues and I've grown to appreciate it more as I've got older. And I think that's what happens with the blues.\" Last year, he filmed a three-part documentary for Sky Arts, called Lenny Henry's Got The Blues. In the final episode, he was seen performing with his Blackacre Road Band - the positive reaction to which led to the album's recording. But, considering Sir Lenny first became famous in the late 1970s, why has he waited until now to turn his attention to music? \"When we were filming the documentary, Ruby Turner described a blues song as being like a nervous breakdown in three minutes, so I think life experience lends itself to the blues. \"You get a sense of growth, who you are and where you're at.\" It's a genre which hasn't ever been as big in the UK as in the US. The average British person may well be able to describe its sound and name a few famous blues artists - but not many would have it in their record collection. \"As Tom Jones said to me, the blues was seen as something of the old guard,\" Sir Lenny says, explaining the genre's lower record sales in Britain. \"It was too tied in with slavery and poverty and miserable stuff for a certain generation. But my experience in the 20th Century is that the blues is not just about being miserable, it's also about standing on a piano and shaking your behind. \"I wanted to go into it with the celebratory nature of it - I didn't want to go into it with the feeling of writing about the most depressing things that have ever happened to me.\" Noticeably, Sir Lenny sings not in his regular speaking accent, but with more of an American inflection. \"I always sing in a semi-American accent because R&B and blues lends itself to that. I think if I was a folk singer it would be different, I'd sing like Lenny Henry from Dudley. \"But because black people invented the form I don't have a problem with adopting an American accent to sing certain songs.\" Diversity 'progress' Sir Lenny has become known in recent years as a diversity campaigner, calling for proportionate representation of ethnic minorities in the entertainment industry. In 2014, he delivered the Bafta Television lecture, where he said radical change was needed both in front of and behind the camera. Later that same year he guest edited the Today programme, overseeing the first ever edition of the BBC Radio 4 show not to feature a single white speaker. Arguably progress has been made since Sir Lenny's 2014 speech. Last month, police drama Undercover became the first ever BBC One drama to be broadcast which featured two non-white leads. Sophie Okonedo and Adrian Lester appear in the series, which sees Okonedo's character on the brink of becoming the first black director of public prosecutions. But, given the relevance of the characters' ethnicity to the storyline, it is not quite the sea change Sir Lenny was hoping for. \"You know what, it's on [TV] and it's progress. It would be churlish to criticise it because it's a black-centred storyline,\" he says. \"Maybe the next thing that somebody else writes will have a couple where it doesn't matter whether they're black or not. \"But in the course of this, yes, it is essential to the plot and Peter Moffat is a great writer, so on we go.\" Progress may well be occurring in television, but Hollywood has also been criticised for its lack of ethnic diversity - most notably at this year's Oscars. The Academy promised to diversify its membership as a result of the \"Oscars So White\" controversy, but it could take some time before we see Hollywood movies with exclusively non-white lead roles. Actor Don Cheadle recently commented it was difficult to get funding for Miles Ahead, the Miles Davis biopic he directed and starred in, without a white actor prominently involved. Ewan McGregor was eventually cast in a lead role. \"I think it's difficult to get anything with an urban storyline to be produced on a big scale, because urban by its very nature sounds like it's marginalised, not the mainstream,\" Sir Lenny says. \"There are some good-hearted people who will fund voices from the margins, but the general rule in movies - particularly because it's such a lot of money that they're investing - is that they want a sure bet, they want a guaranteed audience. \"So in the case of producing a Miles Davis movie, I'd say even though Miles is a cultural icon, it would be seen as a risk subject matter. \"You've got to know what the parameters are, the funds you need, and you've got to work clearly within those parameters, otherwise you're not going to get your movie made.\" Sir Lenny is clearly not a fan of such parameters himself.

But, as he tells the BBC, there's more to the blues than singing about being miserable. By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter Sir Lenny Henry has little left to prove. He's a successful comedian, a respected stage actor and a well-known campaigner for racial diversity in the entertainment industry. He was knighted last year and will receive a special Bafta at this Sunday's TV awards ceremony. So why has he decided to venture into the music industry and become a blues singer? \"Because I've been making music and singing and performing since I was 16 and I've always wanted to make an album,\" he explains. \"I've always loved the blues and I've grown to appreciate it more as I've got older. And I think that's what happens with the blues.\" Last year, he filmed a three-part documentary for Sky Arts, called Lenny Henry's Got The Blues. In the final episode, he was seen performing with his Blackacre Road Band - the positive reaction to which led to the album's recording. But, considering Sir Lenny first became famous in the late 1970s, why has he waited until now to turn his attention to music? \"When we were filming the documentary, Ruby Turner described a blues song as being like a nervous breakdown in three minutes, so I think life experience lends itself to the blues. \"You get a sense of growth, who you are and where you're at.\" It's a genre which hasn't ever been as big in the UK as in the US. The average British person may well be able to describe its sound and name a few famous blues artists - but not many would have it in their record collection. \"As Tom Jones said to me, the blues was seen as something of the old guard,\" Sir Lenny says, explaining the genre's lower record sales in Britain. \"It was too tied in with slavery and poverty and miserable stuff for a certain generation. But my experience in the 20th Century is that the blues is not just about being miserable, it's also about standing on a piano and shaking your behind. \"I wanted to go into it with the celebratory nature of it - I didn't want to go into it with the feeling of writing about the most depressing things that have ever happened to me.\" Noticeably, Sir Lenny sings not in his regular speaking accent, but with more of an American inflection. \"I always sing in a semi-American accent because R&B and blues lends itself to that. I think if I was a folk singer it would be different, I'd sing like Lenny Henry from Dudley. \"But because black people invented the form I don't have a problem with adopting an American accent to sing certain songs.\" Diversity 'progress' Sir Lenny has become known in recent years as a diversity campaigner, calling for proportionate representation of ethnic minorities in the entertainment industry. In 2014, he delivered the Bafta Television lecture, where he said radical change was needed both in front of and behind the camera. Later that same year he guest edited the Today programme, overseeing the first ever edition of the BBC Radio 4 show not to feature a single white speaker. Arguably progress has been made since Sir Lenny's 2014 speech. Last month, police drama Undercover became the first ever BBC One drama to be broadcast which featured two non-white leads. Sophie Okonedo and Adrian Lester appear in the series, which sees Okonedo's character on the brink of becoming the first black director of public prosecutions. But, given the relevance of the characters' ethnicity to the storyline, it is not quite the sea change Sir Lenny was hoping for. \"You know what, it's on [TV] and it's progress. It would be churlish to criticise it because it's a black-centred storyline,\" he says. \"Maybe the next thing that somebody else writes will have a couple where it doesn't matter whether they're black or not. \"But in the course of this, yes, it is essential to the plot and Peter Moffat is a great writer, so on we go.\" Progress may well be occurring in television, but Hollywood has also been criticised for its lack of ethnic diversity - most notably at this year's Oscars. The Academy promised to diversify its membership as a result of the \"Oscars So White\" controversy, but it could take some time before we see Hollywood movies with exclusively non-white lead roles. Actor Don Cheadle recently commented it was difficult to get funding for Miles Ahead, the Miles Davis biopic he directed and starred in, without a white actor prominently involved. Ewan McGregor was eventually cast in a lead role. \"I think it's difficult to get anything with an urban storyline to be produced on a big scale, because urban by its very nature sounds like it's marginalised, not the mainstream,\" Sir Lenny says. \"There are some good-hearted people who will fund voices from the margins, but the general rule in movies - particularly because it's such a lot of money that they're investing - is that they want a sure bet, they want a guaranteed audience. \"So in the case of producing a Miles Davis movie, I'd say even though Miles is a cultural icon, it would be seen as a risk subject matter. \"You've got to know what the parameters are, the funds you need, and you've got to work clearly within those parameters, otherwise you're not going to get your movie made.\" Sir Lenny is clearly not a fan of such parameters himself. With blues singing and beyond, he will invariably continue to break down boundaries for some time to come.

But, as he tells the BBC, there's more to the blues than singing about being miserable. By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter Sir Lenny Henry has little left to prove. He's a successful comedian, a respected stage actor and a well-known campaigner for racial diversity in the entertainment industry. He was knighted last year and will receive a special Bafta at this Sunday's TV awards ceremony. So why has he decided to venture into the music industry and become a blues singer? \"Because I've been making music and singing and performing since I was 16 and I've always wanted to make an album,\" he explains. \"I've always loved the blues and I've grown to appreciate it more as I've got older. And I think that's what happens with the blues.\" Last year, he filmed a three-part documentary for Sky Arts, called Lenny Henry's Got The Blues. In the final episode, he was seen performing with his Blackacre Road Band - the positive reaction to which led to the album's recording. But, considering Sir Lenny first became famous in the late 1970s, why has he waited until now to turn his attention to music? \"When we were filming the documentary, Ruby Turner described a blues song as being like a nervous breakdown in three minutes, so I think life experience lends itself to the blues. \"You get a sense of growth, who you are and where you're at.\" It's a genre which hasn't ever been as big in the UK as in the US. The average British person may well be able to describe its sound and name a few famous blues artists - but not many would have it in their record collection. \"As Tom Jones said to me, the blues was seen as something of the old guard,\" Sir Lenny says, explaining the genre's lower record sales in Britain. \"It was too tied in with slavery and poverty and miserable stuff for a certain generation. But my experience in the 20th Century is that the blues is not just about being miserable, it's also about standing on a piano and shaking your behind. \"I wanted to go into it with the celebratory nature of it - I didn't want to go into it with the feeling of writing about the most depressing things that have ever happened to me.\" Noticeably, Sir Lenny sings not in his regular speaking accent, but with more of an American inflection. \"I always sing in a semi-American accent because R&B and blues lends itself to that. I think if I was a folk singer it would be different, I'd sing like Lenny Henry from Dudley. \"But because black people invented the form I don't have a problem with adopting an American accent to sing certain songs.\" Diversity 'progress' Sir Lenny has become known in recent years as a diversity campaigner, calling for proportionate representation of ethnic minorities in the entertainment industry. In 2014, he delivered the Bafta Television lecture, where he said radical change was needed both in front of and behind the camera. Later that same year he guest edited the Today programme, overseeing the first ever edition of the BBC Radio 4 show not to feature a single white speaker. Arguably progress has been made since Sir Lenny's 2014 speech. Last month, police drama Undercover became the first ever BBC One drama to be broadcast which featured two non-white leads. Sophie Okonedo and Adrian Lester appear in the series, which sees Okonedo's character on the brink of becoming the first black director of public prosecutions. But, given the relevance of the characters' ethnicity to the storyline, it is not quite the sea change Sir Lenny was hoping for. \"You know what, it's on [TV] and it's progress. It would be churlish to criticise it because it's a black-centred storyline,\" he says. \"Maybe the next thing that somebody else writes will have a couple where it doesn't matter whether they're black or not. \"But in the course of this, yes, it is essential to the plot and Peter Moffat is a great writer, so on we go.\" Progress may well be occurring in television, but Hollywood has also been criticised for its lack of ethnic diversity - most notably at this year's Oscars. The Academy promised to diversify its membership as a result of the \"Oscars So White\" controversy, but it could take some time before we see Hollywood movies with exclusively non-white lead roles. Actor Don Cheadle recently commented it was difficult to get funding for Miles Ahead, the Miles Davis biopic he directed and starred in, without a white actor prominently involved. Ewan McGregor was eventually cast in a lead role. \"I think it's difficult to get anything with an urban storyline to be produced on a big scale, because urban by its very nature sounds like it's marginalised, not the mainstream,\" Sir Lenny says. \"There are some good-hearted people who will fund voices from the margins, but the general rule in movies - particularly because it's such a lot of money that they're investing - is that they want a sure bet, they want a guaranteed audience. \"So in the case of producing a Miles Davis movie, I'd say even though Miles is a cultural icon, it would be seen as a risk subject matter. \"You've got to know what the parameters are, the funds you need, and you've got to work clearly within those parameters, otherwise you're not going to get your movie made.\" Sir Lenny is clearly not a fan of such parameters himself.

Conservators believe a set of decorated gilded silver panels, featuring armed warriors going to battle, belong to a helmet, not dissimilar to that found at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk (pictured below). \"If this is a helmet, and we're pretty certain it is, it would most likely be the helmet of a king. \"They're just so rare, this would only be the sixth known one,\" Ms Greaves said. \"The detail is such that you can even see a sense of movement, they're marching to war, fully armed,\" conservator Dr Giovanna Fregni said. She is responsible for analysing the precious panels. After all the pieces are assembled, the helmet will be digitally reproduced and the ultimate hope was that a reconstruction could then be made, Dr Fregni said. One theory is that some of the items in the hoard could even have been produced in the same workshop as treasures found at the Sutton Hoo burial site, Ms Greaves said. But that find pales into comparison to the sheer scale and value of the Staffordshire Hoard. \"This is 60% more [Anglo-Saxon items] than everything we had in the country before,\" Ms Greaves said. \"There are 84 pommel caps from the top of swords, but before the hoard was found there were only 20 known ones in the whole of Britain.\" The quality of items has also surprised researchers.

The items, mainly gold and silver, sometimes decorated with garnets, were torn and hacked apart before being buried, making the conservation team's job even more difficult. Archaeologist Chris Fern, and conservators Kayleigh Fuller and Dr Fregni are responsible for piecing together the various fragments. Ms Fuller said some objects, made up of dozens of pieces, took several days to reconstruct. Similar styles, decorations, fixing holes, cut lines and corrosion marks all help the team to understand which pieces go together - a huge jigsaw puzzle. \"Part of my job is to look at every piece, weigh it, measure it and become so familiar with it that I can identify it and understand exactly where it goes,\" Dr Fregni said. \"They're all measured in millimetres, but now I've been doing it for so long I can look at a piece under the microscope and understand straight away what it is.\" Despite the challenge facing the conservation team, they hope to finish their job in the next year, before the hoard is handed over for further research.

But what has the Staffordshire Hoard taught us about the Anglo-Saxons, and what secrets might it still hold? The items - out of almost 4,000 uncovered - reveal the work of highly skilled and technically advanced smiths. They were even capable of chemically removing alloys in gold to make it seem more golden, and producing slithers of fine, embossed foil, today too delicate to handle directly. All the items are believed to have been made in workshops in what is now England, with only the garnets imported - possibly from Sri Lanka or India. \"At that moment in the 7th Century, they were able to create the best of all of Europe. We truly didn't give them enough credit,\" conservation coordinator Pieta Greaves said. \"Giving them that 'dark age' term is quite unfair.\" As items are painstakingly reconstructed, the best of them are being added to those already on show to the public in Stoke-on-Trent and Birmingham. The hoard Yet, possibly one of the most exciting objects in the whole hoard is yet to be reconstructed, and currently being worked on in the basement Birmingham's Museum and Art Gallery. Conservators believe a set of decorated gilded silver panels, featuring armed warriors going to battle, belong to a helmet, not dissimilar to that found at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk (pictured below). \"If this is a helmet, and we're pretty certain it is, it would most likely be the helmet of a king. \"They're just so rare, this would only be the sixth known one,\" Ms Greaves said. \"The detail is such that you can even see a sense of movement, they're marching to war, fully armed,\" conservator Dr Giovanna Fregni said. She is responsible for analysing the precious panels. After all the pieces are assembled, the helmet will be digitally reproduced and the ultimate hope was that a reconstruction could then be made, Dr Fregni said. One theory is that some of the items in the hoard could even have been produced in the same workshop as treasures found at the Sutton Hoo burial site, Ms Greaves said. But that find pales into comparison to the sheer scale and value of the Staffordshire Hoard. \"This is 60% more [Anglo-Saxon items] than everything we had in the country before,\" Ms Greaves said. \"There are 84 pommel caps from the top of swords, but before the hoard was found there were only 20 known ones in the whole of Britain.\" The quality of items has also surprised researchers.

The items, mainly gold and silver, sometimes decorated with garnets, were torn and hacked apart before being buried, making the conservation team's job even more difficult. Archaeologist Chris Fern, and conservators Kayleigh Fuller and Dr Fregni are responsible for piecing together the various fragments. Ms Fuller said some objects, made up of dozens of pieces, took several days to reconstruct. Similar styles, decorations, fixing holes, cut lines and corrosion marks all help the team to understand which pieces go together - a huge jigsaw puzzle. \"Part of my job is to look at every piece, weigh it, measure it and become so familiar with it that I can identify it and understand exactly where it goes,\" Dr Fregni said. \"They're all measured in millimetres, but now I've been doing it for so long I can look at a piece under the microscope and understand straight away what it is.\" Despite the challenge facing the conservation team, they hope to finish their job in the next year, before the hoard is handed over for further research. When it was discovered, \u00a3900,000 was raised through a public appeal, alongside grant funding, to purchase it for the West Midlands. Further funds have been ploughed into its conservation, but \u00a3120,000 is still needed to complete the job and the project team hopes the public might come to the rescue once again. \"When the hoard was actually discovered they decided to put on a little display both in Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent. In Birmingham we had it for 19 days and 45,000 people came to see it,\" Ms Greaves said. \"It was clear people were excited, even early on. \"It takes some dedication to queue for five hours to see a bit of gold glittering among some mud.\" How and why the hoard came to be buried in a unremarkable field, near Burntwood, remains a mystery, however. One of the main theories is that it was collected off battlefields and used as a treasury to be dispensed like modern day coinage. \"It's not a single battle, there's just too much elite warrior gear in the hoard,\" Ms Greaves said. \"By the time you get them and all their men together, that should have been a battle we've heard of and it just doesn't exist. \"When you look at poems such as Beowulf, they often mention these elite warriors with their amazing weapons and fine decoration. \"But there was no archaeological proof of them, so it was thought they were made up. \"But actually, the hoard is that proof.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize what the items uncovered in Staffordshire Hoard taught us about the Anglo-Saxons.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The Staffordshire Hoard, discovered six years ago, has provided valuable insights into the Anglo-Saxons.

But what has the Staffordshire Hoard taught us about the Anglo-Saxons, and what secrets might it still hold? The items - out of almost 4,000 uncovered - reveal the work of highly skilled and technically advanced smiths. They were even capable of chemically removing alloys in gold to make it seem more golden, and producing slithers of fine, embossed foil, today too delicate to handle directly. All the items are believed to have been made in workshops in what is now England, with only the garnets imported - possibly from Sri Lanka or India. \"At that moment in the 7th Century, they were able to create the best of all of Europe. We truly didn't give them enough credit,\" conservation coordinator Pieta Greaves said. \"Giving them that 'dark age' term is quite unfair.\" As items are painstakingly reconstructed, the best of them are being added to those already on show to the public in Stoke-on-Trent and Birmingham. The hoard Yet, possibly one of the most exciting objects in the whole hoard is yet to be reconstructed, and currently being worked on in the basement Birmingham's Museum and Art Gallery. Conservators believe a set of decorated gilded silver panels, featuring armed warriors going to battle, belong to a helmet, not dissimilar to that found at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk (pictured below). \"If this is a helmet, and we're pretty certain it is, it would most likely be the helmet of a king. \"They're just so rare, this would only be the sixth known one,\" Ms Greaves said. \"The detail is such that you can even see a sense of movement, they're marching to war, fully armed,\" conservator Dr Giovanna Fregni said. She is responsible for analysing the precious panels. After all the pieces are assembled, the helmet will be digitally reproduced and the ultimate hope was that a reconstruction could then be made, Dr Fregni said. One theory is that some of the items in the hoard could even have been produced in the same workshop as treasures found at the Sutton Hoo burial site, Ms Greaves said. But that find pales into comparison to the sheer scale and value of the Staffordshire Hoard. \"This is 60% more [Anglo-Saxon items] than everything we had in the country before,\" Ms Greaves said. \"There are 84 pommel caps from the top of swords, but before the hoard was found there were only 20 known ones in the whole of Britain.\" The quality of items has also surprised researchers. While some items are \"more apprentice\", the overwhelming majority were most likely made for kings and their elite warriors, the project team said. \"We have almost 4,000 fragments, but we think it only represents 450 to 500 objects,\" Ms Greaves said. The items, mainly gold and silver, sometimes decorated with garnets, were torn and hacked apart before being buried, making the conservation team's job even more difficult. Archaeologist Chris Fern, and conservators Kayleigh Fuller and Dr Fregni are responsible for piecing together the various fragments. Ms Fuller said some objects, made up of dozens of pieces, took several days to reconstruct. Similar styles, decorations, fixing holes, cut lines and corrosion marks all help the team to understand which pieces go together - a huge jigsaw puzzle. \"Part of my job is to look at every piece, weigh it, measure it and become so familiar with it that I can identify it and understand exactly where it goes,\" Dr Fregni said. \"They're all measured in millimetres, but now I've been doing it for so long I can look at a piece under the microscope and understand straight away what it is.\" Despite the challenge facing the conservation team, they hope to finish their job in the next year, before the hoard is handed over for further research. When it was discovered, \u00a3900,000 was raised through a public appeal, alongside grant funding, to purchase it for the West Midlands. Further funds have been ploughed into its conservation, but \u00a3120,000 is still needed to complete the job and the project team hopes the public might come to the rescue once again. \"When the hoard was actually discovered they decided to put on a little display both in Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent. In Birmingham we had it for 19 days and 45,000 people came to see it,\" Ms Greaves said. \"It was clear people were excited, even early on. \"It takes some dedication to queue for five hours to see a bit of gold glittering among some mud.\" How and why the hoard came to be buried in a unremarkable field, near Burntwood, remains a mystery, however. One of the main theories is that it was collected off battlefields and used as a treasury to be dispensed like modern day coinage. \"It's not a single battle, there's just too much elite warrior gear in the hoard,\" Ms Greaves said. \"By the time you get them and all their men together, that should have been a battle we've heard of and it just doesn't exist. \"When you look at poems such as Beowulf, they often mention these elite warriors with their amazing weapons and fine decoration. \"But there was no archaeological proof of them, so it was thought they were made up. \"But actually, the hoard is that proof.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize what the items uncovered in Staffordshire Hoard taught us about the Anglo-Saxons.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The Staffordshire Hoard, discovered six years ago, has provided valuable insights into the Anglo-Saxons.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nThe decline that is on the horizon for the Bridgend engine plant is the latest phase of a shift in gear that has been going on since the early 1990s. By Sarah DickinsBBC Wales economics correspondent The change in emphasis goes back to 2008 and the \"one Ford Plan\" - the decision at Ford HQ in Dearborn in the States to \"go global.\" This meant operating as a global company and no longer having Ford UK and Ford Europe making different designs of cars compared with the USA and rest of the world. In contrast it would become a more centralised global operation with the same models selling across the world and investment going to the plants that can prove they are the most efficient. For Wales, and the Bridgend engine plant, that meant it would not just have to compete to be more efficient than Ford's engine plants in Valencia and Cologne - which it had done successfully for decades - it would in future have to compete globally. When Ford decided to cease car assembly in the UK, that made the landscape more challenging for Bridgend. The Halewood plant in Liverpool stopped assembling cars for Ford in 1997 and concentrated on Jaguar and later vehicles for Jaguar Land Rover. Ford also stopped assembling cars at its Dagenham plant in Essex in 2002, concentrating on engines instead. In 2013, the Transit van factory in Southampton closed, marking the end of Ford making vehicles in the UK. Now engines made in Bridgend are shipped all over the world to be put into cars before being sent back to showrooms in the UK . You may well be driving around Wales in a Ford car with a Welsh engine but the car will probably have been built in Germany. With Ford's European car assembly also based in Romania, Russia and Turkey, it is now a long and less efficient way of supplying engines to production lines. With Brexit now on the agenda and the possibility of trade barriers, duties - taxes in effect being put on UK products entering the EU and also goods flowing from the EU to the UK - factories making engines here will have to be even more efficient to be kept open by Ford. For the Bridgend engine plant all these factors coming together is increasing the pressure. If an engine entering Valencia had a tariff added to its cost only to be then shipped back to the UK with another tariff put on it then it is easy to see why Ford might consider in the future using engines made in Valencia in cars assembled in the same plant. HOW FORD CAME TO BRIDGEND Ford chose Bridgend for its new engine plant in the summer of 1977 after competition from elsewhere in Europe, chiefly from Ireland. The company had gone back to the Welsh Development Agency, which it impressed despite rejecting deals for two smaller projects. It needed an engine for its new model - code-named Erika - which was designed to rescue the company from the doldrums, especially in Europe and America. The car became the next generation Ford Escort, and would be built at Halewood on Merseyside and at Saarlouis in Germany from 1980. The American company looked at sites in Briton Ferry, Shotton and was close to choosing Llantrisant before opting for development land in Bridgend. The deal was finalised after the then Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan - also a Cardiff MP - entertained the Ford Europe chairman at Chequers and then also invited Henry Ford - the grandson of the company's founder - to lunch at No 10. The firm had concerns about strikes and Britain's industrial relations record. But the deal was worth \u00a336m in government money out of the \u00a3180m total cost - although there was also investment at other plants in the UK tied in. The grants for buildings and equipment also included \u00a31m towards a new rail link to the plant. The promise was 2,500 jobs but by the time it opened in May 1980, Ford had decided to take on only 1,400 workers. Some of the work had already been switched to Valencia. The new Escort would have three different sized engines, not all made at Bridgend. Some would also go into the smaller Ford Fiesta. Executives had also been to Japan to see production techniques and the same number of engines could be produced there by just 800 workers. But with industries like steel and mining in difficulty, there was still a big response in south Wales - 22,000 people applied for the new jobs and it would become one of the most important employers along the \"M4 corridor\". The \"Erika\" and her successor would by the end of the 1980s be arguably the UK's most popular car with more than 1.6m models on the roads. When Ford announced in 2015 that Bridgend has secured investment for the next petrol engine project called Dragon it said 250,000 engines would be made a year. The plant has a capacity for three times that and at the time there were those who were concerned that this signalled the start of a run down of the plant. The news in September that the proposed engine production was to be reduced to 125,000 was even more concerning, and has built up in recent months to unions looking for clarity from Ford about its intentions. At the moment 1,850 people work at Ford Bridgend making the Sigma engine and also engines for Jaguar. It has planned to cease making engines for Jaguar in 2019 - the same year as production of the Sigma engine for Ford is due to end. It is hard to see how Ford can retain anywhere near the existing level of workers when it is no longer making engines for Jaguar and with a relatively small turnover of new Dragon engines. But it is not just the size of the workforce that could become unsustainable; the site is massive and it would become increasingly hard for local managers to argue the case that the plant makes economic sense to global Ford.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the \"One Ford Plan\" and its implications for Ford's operations in two sentences.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The \"One Ford Plan\" was a decision by Ford HQ in 2008 to operate as a global company, with the same models selling across the world.

In 2013, the Transit van factory in Southampton closed, marking the end of Ford making vehicles in the UK. Now engines made in Bridgend are shipped all over the world to be put into cars before being sent back to showrooms in the UK . You may well be driving around Wales in a Ford car with a Welsh engine but the car will probably have been built in Germany. With Ford's European car assembly also based in Romania, Russia and Turkey, it is now a long and less efficient way of supplying engines to production lines. With Brexit now on the agenda and the possibility of trade barriers, duties - taxes in effect being put on UK products entering the EU and also goods flowing from the EU to the UK - factories making engines here will have to be even more efficient to be kept open by Ford. For the Bridgend engine plant all these factors coming together is increasing the pressure. If an engine entering Valencia had a tariff added to its cost only to be then shipped back to the UK with another tariff put on it then it is easy to see why Ford might consider in the future using engines made in Valencia in cars assembled in the same plant. HOW FORD CAME TO BRIDGEND Ford chose Bridgend for its new engine plant in the summer of 1977 after competition from elsewhere in Europe, chiefly from Ireland. The company had gone back to the Welsh Development Agency, which it impressed despite rejecting deals for two smaller projects. It needed an engine for its new model - code-named Erika - which was designed to rescue the company from the doldrums, especially in Europe and America. The car became the next generation Ford Escort, and would be built at Halewood on Merseyside and at Saarlouis in Germany from 1980. The American company looked at sites in Briton Ferry, Shotton and was close to choosing Llantrisant before opting for development land in Bridgend. The deal was finalised after the then Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan - also a Cardiff MP - entertained the Ford Europe chairman at Chequers and then also invited Henry Ford - the grandson of the company's founder - to lunch at No 10. The firm had concerns about strikes and Britain's industrial relations record. But the deal was worth \u00a336m in government money out of the \u00a3180m total cost - although there was also investment at other plants in the UK tied in. The grants for buildings and equipment also included \u00a31m towards a new rail link to the plant. The promise was 2,500 jobs but by the time it opened in May 1980, Ford had decided to take on only 1,400 workers. Some of the work had already been switched to Valencia. The new Escort would have three different sized engines, not all made at Bridgend. Some would also go into the smaller Ford Fiesta. Executives had also been to Japan to see production techniques and the same number of engines could be produced there by just 800 workers. But with industries like steel and mining in difficulty, there was still a big response in south Wales - 22,000 people applied for the new jobs and it would become one of the most important employers along the \"M4 corridor\". The \"Erika\" and her successor would by the end of the 1980s be arguably the UK's most popular car with more than 1.6m models on the roads. When Ford announced in 2015 that Bridgend has secured investment for the next petrol engine project called Dragon it said 250,000 engines would be made a year. The plant has a capacity for three times that and at the time there were those who were concerned that this signalled the start of a run down of the plant. The news in September that the proposed engine production was to be reduced to 125,000 was even more concerning, and has built up in recent months to unions looking for clarity from Ford about its intentions. At the moment 1,850 people work at Ford Bridgend making the Sigma engine and also engines for Jaguar. It has planned to cease making engines for Jaguar in 2019 - the same year as production of the Sigma engine for Ford is due to end. It is hard to see how Ford can retain anywhere near the existing level of workers when it is no longer making engines for Jaguar and with a relatively small turnover of new Dragon engines. But it is not just the size of the workforce that could become unsustainable; the site is massive and it would become increasingly hard for local managers to argue the case that the plant makes economic sense to global Ford.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the \"One Ford Plan\" and its implications for Ford's operations in two sentences.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The \"One Ford Plan\" was a decision made in 2008 to centralize Ford's operations, creating a global company with the same models selling worldwide and investments going to the most efficient plants.

By Sarah DickinsBBC Wales economics correspondent The change in emphasis goes back to 2008 and the \"one Ford Plan\" - the decision at Ford HQ in Dearborn in the States to \"go global.\" This meant operating as a global company and no longer having Ford UK and Ford Europe making different designs of cars compared with the USA and rest of the world. In contrast it would become a more centralised global operation with the same models selling across the world and investment going to the plants that can prove they are the most efficient. For Wales, and the Bridgend engine plant, that meant it would not just have to compete to be more efficient than Ford's engine plants in Valencia and Cologne - which it had done successfully for decades - it would in future have to compete globally. When Ford decided to cease car assembly in the UK, that made the landscape more challenging for Bridgend.

It has been left to others to come up with a definition that can be used to weigh the actions, omissions and behaviour of security forces in a series of murders in which they have been accused of collusion. For some, a charge of collusion can only stick if there has been a secret agreement to deliberately and consciously plot to do something wrong. For others the definition would also cover having a mindset that means that officers were predisposed to behave or think in ways that meant some people were less protected than they should have been, that investigations were frustrated to protect agents and informers, regardless of their actions. The first official attempt at a definition was made by Sir John (now Lord) Stevens in 2003. Lord Stevens, the then Metropolitan Police Commissioner, carried out a major investigation into collusion in several murders. He said collusion ranges \"from the wilful failure to keep records, the absence of accountability, the withholding of intelligence and evidence, through to the extreme of agents being involved in murder.\" Applying that definition to his three inquiries he reported: \"The co-ordination, dissemination and sharing of intelligence were poor. Informants and agents were allowed to operate without effective control and to participate in terrorist crimes. \"Nationalists were known to be targeted but were not properly warned or protected. Crucial information was withheld from senior investigating officers. Important evidence was neither exploited nor preserved.\" In 2004, Canadian judge Peter Cory published six reports into alleged collusion in murders in Northern Ireland. In outlining his definition of collusion he highlighted several dictionary definitions of the word including \"to co-operate secretly: to have a secret understanding.\" He added definitions of connive, a synonym of the verb collude, including this entry from the Oxford Compact Thesaurus: \"to deliberately ignore; to overlook; to disregard; to pass over; to take no notice of; to turn a blind eye; to wink; to excuse; to condone; to look the other way; to let something ride.\" 'Connivance' From the Webster dictionary, he quoted: \"To pretend ignorance or unawareness of something one ought morally, or officially or legally to oppose; to fail to take action against a known wrongdoing or misbehaviour - usually used with connive at the violation of a law.\" He went on to write: \"How should collusion be defined for the purposes of this inquiry?\" \"There cannot be public confidence in any government agency that is guilty of collusion or connivance with regard to serious crimes. Because of the necessity for public confidence in government agencies the definition of collusion must be reasonably broad when it is applied to such agencies. \"That is to say that they must not act collusively by ignoring or turning a blind eye to the wrongful acts of their servants or agents or by supplying information to assist those servants or agents in their wrongful acts or by encouraging others to commit a wrongful act.\" An inquiry into the death of Billy Wright, in the Maze prison in 1997, took issue with the emphasis on connivance. \"It may be that the very wide definition of the word collusion that Judge Cory adopted was due to his concentration on one of the synonyms, namely the verb connive,\" the inquiry report said. \"We have been concerned throughout the inquiry by the width of the meaning applied by Judge Cory, having in mind in particular that the word is not to be found in our terms of reference. \"For our part we consider that the essence of collusion is an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organisations, including government departments, to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose. The purpose may also be fraudulent or underhand.\" The first police ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala (now Baroness) O'Loan adopted the definitions, in 2007, of Lord Stevens and Peter Cory to examine whether there had been collusion in the murder of Raymond McCord jnr. Using those definitions, she concluded that there had been collusion. Her successor as police ombudsman, Al Hutchinson, applied a less broad definition in his report on the attack, in 1971, on McGurk's Bar. In the report he wrote: \"The essence of collusion requires that a number of elements be present. Not only must there usually be an agreement between two or more parties, but there is also an additional requirement that a sufficiency of evidence exists to establish, on balance, that the act or omission complained of was deliberate and not merely negligent or inadvertent.\" In his review of the murder of Pat Finucane, Sir Christopher de Silva said he had adopted a \"working definition\" of collusion less broad than that of Judge Cory and more in line with that of the Billy Wright inquiry panel. \"I do believe, as Judge Smithwick has said in relation to his Tribunal, that omissions by state agencies must be considered alongside positive acts when drawing a definition of collusion. \"It is, however, important to stress that, in order to fall within the ambit of collusion, such omissions must be classified as deliberate and not merely represent examples of incompetence or inefficiency. \"My own working definition, whilst not purporting to be definitive, is one I consider appropriate in relation to the allegations made and for the purposes of this particular case. \"I consider collusion to involve: (i) agreements, arrangements or actions intended to achieve unlawful, improper, fraudulent or underhand objectives; and (ii) deliberately turning a blind eye or deliberately ignoring improper or unlawful activity.\" Irish judge Peter Smithwick gave a similar definition of collusion to that of Peter Cory. Smithwick, investigating allegations of Garda collusion in the murders of RUC officers Chief Supt Harry Breen and Supt Bob Buchanan, said: \"While (collusion) generally means the commission of an act, I am also of the view that it should be considered in terms of an omission or failure to act. \"In the active sense, collusion has amongst its meanings to conspire, connive or collaborate. \"In addition I intend to examine whether anybody deliberately ignored a matter, or turned a blind eye to it, or to have pretended ignorance or unawareness of something one ought morally, legally or officially oppose.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nDescribe the people who gave their definition of collusion in this article.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The article discusses different definitions of collusion, as well as the people who have provided their own definitions of the term.

Not only must there usually be an agreement between two or more parties, but there is also an additional requirement that a sufficiency of evidence exists to establish, on balance, that the act or omission complained of was deliberate and not merely negligent or inadvertent.\" In his review of the murder of Pat Finucane, Sir Christopher de Silva said he had adopted a \"working definition\" of collusion less broad than that of Judge Cory and more in line with that of the Billy Wright inquiry panel. \"I do believe, as Judge Smithwick has said in relation to his Tribunal, that omissions by state agencies must be considered alongside positive acts when drawing a definition of collusion. \"It is, however, important to stress that, in order to fall within the ambit of collusion, such omissions must be classified as deliberate and not merely represent examples of incompetence or inefficiency. \"My own working definition, whilst not purporting to be definitive, is one I consider appropriate in relation to the allegations made and for the purposes of this particular case. \"I consider collusion to involve: (i) agreements, arrangements or actions intended to achieve unlawful, improper, fraudulent or underhand objectives; and (ii) deliberately turning a blind eye or deliberately ignoring improper or unlawful activity.\" Irish judge Peter Smithwick gave a similar definition of collusion to that of Peter Cory. Smithwick, investigating allegations of Garda collusion in the murders of RUC officers Chief Supt Harry Breen and Supt Bob Buchanan, said: \"While (collusion) generally means the commission of an act, I am also of the view that it should be considered in terms of an omission or failure to act. \"In the active sense, collusion has amongst its meanings to conspire, connive or collaborate. \"In addition I intend to examine whether anybody deliberately ignored a matter, or turned a blind eye to it, or to have pretended ignorance or unawareness of something one ought morally, legally or officially oppose.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the similarities of the definitions of collusion provided by different people in this article.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:\n\n# Output (a):\nSeveral definitions of collusion have been proposed by different people in the article. Most of these definitions involve an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose, and the deliberate ignoring or turning a blind eye to a known wrongdoing or misbehavior. Many of them also include the withholding of intelligence and evidence, and the failure to keep records or to take action against a known wrongdoing.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe different definitions of collusion provided in the article all agree that collusion involves some form of agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations, usually with the intention of achieving an unlawful or improper purpose. Additionally, all of the definitions agree that collusion can involve either positive actions or deliberate omissions, and that both should be considered when determining whether collusion has occurred.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nOutput (a) is better.\n\nExplanation:\nThe article discusses various definitions of collusion provided by different people, including Sir John (now Lord) Stevens, Canadian judge Peter Cory, the first police ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala (now Baroness) O'Loan, Al Hutchinson, and Sir Christopher de Silva. These definitions all agree that collusion involves an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose, and that it can involve both positive actions and deliberate omissions. The definitions also emphasize the importance of intelligence and evidence, as well as the need to take action against known wrongdoing.\n\nOutput (b) is better.\n\nExplanation:\nOutput (b) is a summary of the similarities of the definitions of collusion provided by different people in the article. It highlights that all the definitions agree that collusion involves an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose, and that it can involve both positive actions and deliberate omissions. Additionally, all the definitions agree that both positive actions and deliberate omissions should be considered when determining whether collusion has occurred.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\nIn the article, it is evident that the different people who provided definitions of collusion all agreed on the core elements of collusion. These elements include an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organizations, the intention of achieving an unlawful or improper purpose, and the deliberate ignoring or turning a blind eye to a known wrongdoing or misbehavior. Additionally, all definitions agreed that collusion can involve both positive actions and deliberate omissions.

In outlining his definition of collusion he highlighted several dictionary definitions of the word including \"to co-operate secretly: to have a secret understanding.\" He added definitions of connive, a synonym of the verb collude, including this entry from the Oxford Compact Thesaurus: \"to deliberately ignore; to overlook; to disregard; to pass over; to take no notice of; to turn a blind eye; to wink; to excuse; to condone; to look the other way; to let something ride.\" 'Connivance' From the Webster dictionary, he quoted: \"To pretend ignorance or unawareness of something one ought morally, or officially or legally to oppose; to fail to take action against a known wrongdoing or misbehaviour - usually used with connive at the violation of a law.\" He went on to write: \"How should collusion be defined for the purposes of this inquiry?\" \"There cannot be public confidence in any government agency that is guilty of collusion or connivance with regard to serious crimes. Because of the necessity for public confidence in government agencies the definition of collusion must be reasonably broad when it is applied to such agencies. \"That is to say that they must not act collusively by ignoring or turning a blind eye to the wrongful acts of their servants or agents or by supplying information to assist those servants or agents in their wrongful acts or by encouraging others to commit a wrongful act.\" An inquiry into the death of Billy Wright, in the Maze prison in 1997, took issue with the emphasis on connivance. \"It may be that the very wide definition of the word collusion that Judge Cory adopted was due to his concentration on one of the synonyms, namely the verb connive,\" the inquiry report said. \"We have been concerned throughout the inquiry by the width of the meaning applied by Judge Cory, having in mind in particular that the word is not to be found in our terms of reference. \"For our part we consider that the essence of collusion is an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organisations, including government departments, to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose. The purpose may also be fraudulent or underhand.\" The first police ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala (now Baroness) O'Loan adopted the definitions, in 2007, of Lord Stevens and Peter Cory to examine whether there had been collusion in the murder of Raymond McCord jnr. Using those definitions, she concluded that there had been collusion. Her successor as police ombudsman, Al Hutchinson, applied a less broad definition in his report on the attack, in 1971, on McGurk's Bar. In the report he wrote: \"The essence of collusion requires that a number of elements be present. Not only must there usually be an agreement between two or more parties, but there is also an additional requirement that a sufficiency of evidence exists to establish, on balance, that the act or omission complained of was deliberate and not merely negligent or inadvertent.\" In his review of the murder of Pat Finucane, Sir Christopher de Silva said he had adopted a \"working definition\" of collusion less broad than that of Judge Cory and more in line with that of the Billy Wright inquiry panel. \"I do believe, as Judge Smithwick has said in relation to his Tribunal, that omissions by state agencies must be considered alongside positive acts when drawing a definition of collusion. \"It is, however, important to stress that, in order to fall within the ambit of collusion, such omissions must be classified as deliberate and not merely represent examples of incompetence or inefficiency. \"My own working definition, whilst not purporting to be definitive, is one I consider appropriate in relation to the allegations made and for the purposes of this particular case. \"I consider collusion to involve: (i) agreements, arrangements or actions intended to achieve unlawful, improper, fraudulent or underhand objectives; and (ii) deliberately turning a blind eye or deliberately ignoring improper or unlawful activity.\" Irish judge Peter Smithwick gave a similar definition of collusion to that of Peter Cory. Smithwick, investigating allegations of Garda collusion in the murders of RUC officers Chief Supt Harry Breen and Supt Bob Buchanan, said: \"While (collusion) generally means the commission of an act, I am also of the view that it should be considered in terms of an omission or failure to act. \"In the active sense, collusion has amongst its meanings to conspire, connive or collaborate. \"In addition I intend to examine whether anybody deliberately ignored a matter, or turned a blind eye to it, or to have pretended ignorance or unawareness of something one ought morally, legally or officially oppose.\"\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the similarities of the definitions of collusion provided by different people in this article.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "The definitions of collusion provided by different people in the article share several similarities.

By Sarah DickinsBBC Wales economics correspondent The change in emphasis goes back to 2008 and the \"one Ford Plan\" - the decision at Ford HQ in Dearborn in the States to \"go global.\" This meant operating as a global company and no longer having Ford UK and Ford Europe making different designs of cars compared with the USA and rest of the world. In contrast it would become a more centralised global operation with the same models selling across the world and investment going to the plants that can prove they are the most efficient. For Wales, and the Bridgend engine plant, that meant it would not just have to compete to be more efficient than Ford's engine plants in Valencia and Cologne - which it had done successfully for decades - it would in future have to compete globally. When Ford decided to cease car assembly in the UK, that made the landscape more challenging for Bridgend. The Halewood plant in Liverpool stopped assembling cars for Ford in 1997 and concentrated on Jaguar and later vehicles for Jaguar Land Rover. Ford also stopped assembling cars at its Dagenham plant in Essex in 2002, concentrating on engines instead. In 2013, the Transit van factory in Southampton closed, marking the end of Ford making vehicles in the UK. Now engines made in Bridgend are shipped all over the world to be put into cars before being sent back to showrooms in the UK . You may well be driving around Wales in a Ford car with a Welsh engine but the car will probably have been built in Germany. With Ford's European car assembly also based in Romania, Russia and Turkey, it is now a long and less efficient way of supplying engines to production lines. With Brexit now on the agenda and the possibility of trade barriers, duties - taxes in effect being put on UK products entering the EU and also goods flowing from the EU to the UK - factories making engines here will have to be even more efficient to be kept open by Ford. For the Bridgend engine plant all these factors coming together is increasing the pressure. If an engine entering Valencia had a tariff added to its cost only to be then shipped back to the UK with another tariff put on it then it is easy to see why Ford might consider in the future using engines made in Valencia in cars assembled in the same plant. HOW FORD CAME TO BRIDGEND Ford chose Bridgend for its new engine plant in the summer of 1977 after competition from elsewhere in Europe, chiefly from Ireland. The company had gone back to the Welsh Development Agency, which it impressed despite rejecting deals for two smaller projects. It needed an engine for its new model - code-named Erika - which was designed to rescue the company from the doldrums, especially in Europe and America. The car became the next generation Ford Escort, and would be built at Halewood on Merseyside and at Saarlouis in Germany from 1980. The American company looked at sites in Briton Ferry, Shotton and was close to choosing Llantrisant before opting for development land in Bridgend. The deal was finalised after the then Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan - also a Cardiff MP - entertained the Ford Europe chairman at Chequers and then also invited Henry Ford - the grandson of the company's founder - to lunch at No 10. The firm had concerns about strikes and Britain's industrial relations record. But the deal was worth \u00a336m in government money out of the \u00a3180m total cost - although there was also investment at other plants in the UK tied in. The grants for buildings and equipment also included \u00a31m towards a new rail link to the plant. The promise was 2,500 jobs but by the time it opened in May 1980, Ford had decided to take on only 1,400 workers. Some of the work had already been switched to Valencia. The new Escort would have three different sized engines, not all made at Bridgend. Some would also go into the smaller Ford Fiesta. Executives had also been to Japan to see production techniques and the same number of engines could be produced there by just 800 workers. But with industries like steel and mining in difficulty, there was still a big response in south Wales - 22,000 people applied for the new jobs and it would become one of the most important employers along the \"M4 corridor\". The \"Erika\" and her successor would by the end of the 1980s be arguably the UK's most popular car with more than 1.6m models on the roads. When Ford announced in 2015 that Bridgend has secured investment for the next petrol engine project called Dragon it said 250,000 engines would be made a year. The plant has a capacity for three times that and at the time there were those who were concerned that this signalled the start of a run down of the plant. The news in September that the proposed engine production was to be reduced to 125,000 was even more concerning, and has built up in recent months to unions looking for clarity from Ford about its intentions. At the moment 1,850 people work at Ford Bridgend making the Sigma engine and also engines for Jaguar. It has planned to cease making engines for Jaguar in 2019 - the same year as production of the Sigma engine for Ford is due to end. It is hard to see how Ford can retain anywhere near the existing level of workers when it is no longer making engines for Jaguar and with a relatively small turnover of new Dragon engines.

The \"Erika\" and her successor would by the end of the 1980s be arguably the UK's most popular car with more than 1.6m models on the roads. When Ford announced in 2015 that Bridgend has secured investment for the next petrol engine project called Dragon it said 250,000 engines would be made a year. The plant has a capacity for three times that and at the time there were those who were concerned that this signalled the start of a run down of the plant. The news in September that the proposed engine production was to be reduced to 125,000 was even more concerning, and has built up in recent months to unions looking for clarity from Ford about its intentions. At the moment 1,850 people work at Ford Bridgend making the Sigma engine and also engines for Jaguar. It has planned to cease making engines for Jaguar in 2019 - the same year as production of the Sigma engine for Ford is due to end. It is hard to see how Ford can retain anywhere near the existing level of workers when it is no longer making engines for Jaguar and with a relatively small turnover of new Dragon engines. But it is not just the size of the workforce that could become unsustainable; the site is massive and it would become increasingly hard for local managers to argue the case that the plant makes economic sense to global Ford.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the information about Ford in a timeline.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "- 1977: Ford chooses Bridgend for its new engine plant after competition from other European locations.\n- 1980: Bridgend plant opens with 1,400 workers, producing engines for the next generation Ford Escort.

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nThe EU is poised to set up a joint system for police and justice officials to access airline passenger data, covering all flights to and from the EU. The need to prevent terrorism, in particular, is cited as justification for it. Passenger Name Record (PNR) data is already collected by airlines but new legislation sets out detailed rules for national authorities to access it when tackling serious crime. The new PNR directive is expected to be passed in the European Parliament on Thursday. Gun and bomb attacks by the Islamic State (IS) group in Paris last year and Brussels this year boosted support for such data monitoring in the EU. What passenger details does PNR cover? When you book a flight the airline routinely collects PNR data, including: names, contact details, itinerary, the credit card used for payment and baggage information. Passport details are also collected, known as the Advance Passenger Information (API). That data is processed for commercial purposes but the plan now is to set up \"Passenger Information Units\" (PIUs) in each EU member state, where PNR data will be stored. Processing of PNR data to prevent terrorism or other serious crimes will be the responsibility of the new units, not the airlines. The units will pass the data on to law enforcement officials only in such specific cases. The text rules out any processing of data revealing a person's race or ethnic origin, religion, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life. PIUs will be obliged to delete any such data if they receive it. That is to avoid infringing EU anti-discrimination law, embodied in treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The parliament's lead negotiator - or rapporteur - on the PNR issue is UK Conservative MEP Timothy Kirkhope. He said the amount of information gathered from an individual was \"much less than, say, when you open a clubcard account with a local supermarket\". In order to comply with EU data protection legislation, there is to be no automatic data transfer from PIUs. Transfers will have to be strictly in line with the remit to combat serious crime, and handled by \"highly trained operatives\", Mr Kirkhope said. Why is the EU doing this? The existing use of PNR data to combat serious crime in the EU is regarded as patchy. The IS attacks - which caused more than 160 deaths - caused great alarm about intelligence gaps. There have been urgent calls for police across Europe to exchange timely information on terrorists and other criminals, which could save lives. An EU-wide PNR system for crime prevention was first proposed in 2007 but lawmakers struggled to pass it because of privacy concerns. The UK already has such a system and other countries, including France and Italy, have been developing their own. In 2013, the European Commission provided \u20ac50m (\u00a340m; $57m) of funding to 14 EU countries for that purpose. All 28 EU states apart from Denmark will participate in the new PNR system. Mr Kirkhope said it was important for the EU to establish \"common high standards\" on data exchanges and privacy, \"so we don't end up with a piecemeal arrangement\". He said PNR data had already helped to thwart some terrorist attacks. It was \"instrumental\" in capturing collaborators of the 7 July 2005 London bombers and the 2008 Mumbai terror attackers, he argued. Besides terrorism, the serious crimes covered by the new legislation include trafficking in drugs, people or weapons; cybercrime; and sexual exploitation of children. Is PNR data sent to countries outside the EU? Yes. The EU has PNR exchange agreements with the US, Canada and Australia, and is negotiating one with Mexico. After the 11 September 2001 attacks by al-Qaeda the US authorities demanded that all carriers flying to the US provide PNR data. The EU says detailed passenger data can only be sent to countries that meet the EU's own data protection standards. The new PNR directive will also prohibit transfers of PNR data from one non-EU country to another. How long will PNR data be retained? The compromise agreed with EU governments says PNR data will be retained for five years maximum, so that law enforcement officials can access it if necessary. After six months the data will be \"masked out\" or anonymised by PIUs. But during the five-year period investigators in a serious crime case will be able to \"unmask\" it if necessary to reveal a suspect's details. Privacy is a big issue in the EU - does this directive go too far? There are major privacy concerns - not least because in 2014 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) struck down an EU data retention directive, which allowed telecoms firms to store citizens' communications data for up to two years. The ECJ ruled that the directive violated some fundamental privacy rights. The European Digital Rights (EDRI) campaign group argues that a five-year data retention period is too long, that the directive may not prevent discriminatory profiling of individuals and that it will be an ineffective tool against terrorism. EDRI and others have pointed out that PNR was irrelevant in the Paris and Brussels bombings - those jihadists did not fly to Europe to carry out their attacks. Instead, critics say, the EU should focus on improving intelligence-sharing between police forces. The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) has also questioned the effectiveness of PNR collection for crime prevention. FRA says any such law needs to be backed up by statistical analysis, to detect any discrimination and measure the importance of PNR in crime investigations. There will be a review of the new PNR system two years after it is launched. So far there is no overall estimate of the cost. And the system will only apply to intra-EU flights on a voluntary basis. Some see that as a weakness. For example, if the French authorities wanted to see PNR data for incoming flights from Greece they would have to tell the EU Commission about that - it would not be automatic.\n\nHere is an summary requirement:\nSummarize the concerns and opposition from the public about the new PNR directive into bullet points for the views of each group.\n\nPlease summarize the above article based on the given requirement:", "output_1": "Concerns and opposition from the public about the new PNR directive can be summarized as follows:\n\nEuropean Digital Rights (EDRI) campaign group:\n- Five-year data retention period is too long\n- Directive may not prevent discriminatory profiling of individuals\n- Ineffective tool against terrorism\n\nEU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA):\n- Effectiveness of PNR collection for crime prevention is questionable\n- Any such law needs to be backed up by statistical analysis to detect discrimination and measure the importance of PNR in crime investigations\n\nCritics:\n- EU should focus on improving intelligence-sharing between police forces\n- PNR was irrelevant in the Paris and Brussels bombings as the jihadists did not fly to Europe to carry out their attacks\n\nPrivacy concerns:\n- European Court of Justice (ECJ) struck down an EU data retention directive in 2014, violating fundamental privacy rights\n- PNR data includes sensitive information such as race, religion, and sexual life\n- PIUs will be obliged to delete any such data if they receive it to avoid infringing EU anti-discrimination law\n- No automatic data transfer from PIUs to comply with EU data protection legislation", "output_2": "-The European Digital Rights (EDRI) campaign group argues that a five-year data retention period is too long, that the directive may not prevent discriminatory profiling of individuals and that it will be an ineffective tool against terrorism.\n\n-The European Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) has also questioned the effectiveness of PNR collection for crime prevention, saying that any such law needs to be backed up by statistical analysis to detect any discrimination and measure the importance of PNR in crime investigations.\n\n-Critics say that the EU should focus on improving intelligence-sharing between police forces, rather than on PNR data collection.", "winner": 1, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

{"prompt": null, "response": [{"winner": 1}], "instruction": "Here is an article:\nThe leaders of Canada's four main political parties will take part in the first of two televised debates on Tuesday evening, with opposition leaders likely to focus on new allegations of spending mismanagement aimed at the incumbent Conservatives. By Lee CarterBBC News, Toronto The issue has injected a spark of interest into a campaign many observers say has been lacklustre, as Canadian voters prepare to head wearily to the polls on 2 May for the fourth time in seven years. The election was triggered by a non-confidence vote in Canada's parliament, which came after Prime Minister Stephen Harper's minority government was criticised for failing to provide details about several controversial areas of spending, including the budget for new fighter jets. Spending questions seemed to dog Mr Harper's Conservatives again this week. A leaked auditor general's draft report on last summer's G8/G20 summit in Canada alleged the government spent millions of dollars on dubious projects and that parliament was \"misled\" about the spending. The Conservatives have dismissed the allegations, insisting that the final report will be less damning, and Auditor General Sheila Fraser has said she will not release the final report until after the new parliament is seated. Nevertheless, the controversy has put Mr Harper's campaign on the defensive heading into the debate. The leader of the main opposition Liberal Party, Michael Ignatieff, will almost certainly seize on the allegations to cast the Harper government as untrustworthy. Questions of honesty But Mr Ignatieff also has a lot to prove in the debates, as the only one of the four leaders fighting an election for the first time. And Conservative advertisements attacking the patriotism of the Liberal leader, who spent much of his career away from Canada, appear to have had some success. Despite an energetic campaign, the author and former political commentator has made little headway in opinion polls, with his party trailing the Conservatives by 8.5 points in a Nanos Research poll released on Tuesday. Allan Bonner, a Toronto-based political consultant, said Mr Ignatieff had to seize the opportunity in the debates to demonstrate that he has leadership qualities and to use the auditor general's report as a \"springboard\" to raise questions in voters' minds about the Conservatives' honesty and spending. \"He needs to show a broader performance, a deeper knowledge of the issues, maybe deliver some soaring rhetoric,\" Mr Bonner said. Buoyed by what Mr Bonner calls \"the power of incumbency\", the technocratic Mr Harper has run a cautious, tightly controlled campaign, promising to give a boost to retirement savings accounts and to eliminate the country's budget deficit by 2014. \"He's selling himself as a good and diligent but rather dour manager,\" Mr Bonner said. \"We have seen the range of emotions from Stephen Harper running all the way through from L to M in the alphabet and that's probably what we're going to see in the debate.\" Jockeying for position New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jack Layton and Gilles Duceppe, who heads the Quebec nationalist party Bloc Quebecois, will also be jockeying for position at the debates. Controversially, the Green Party, led by popular leader Elizabeth May, has been excluded from the forum. Mr Layton, who has recently recovered from a hip operation and a brush with cancer, has conducted a feisty and passionate campaign, promising among other things to secure long-term funding for the country's public healthcare system by increasing corporate taxes. But the latest polling by Nanos Research shows NDP support falling to 16.8% from a high of 19.9% on 15 March. National Post political columnist John Ivison said the Liberals were trying to take advantage of the crowded and divided opposition to attract leftist New Democrat voters. \"Their platform is becoming virtually identical to the NDP's,\" he said. \"There's a lot of promises of money for childcare, family care and post-secondary education - all the things NDP voters care about.\" Toronto swing Mr Ivison also said Canada's largest metropolitan area was a key battleground in the Conservatives' much-vaunted quest to form a majority, after heading a minority government since 2006. Toronto is the country's commercial and financial capital, with a diverse population of more than 5.1 million in the metropolitan area. The city has long been a stronghold for the federal Liberals, who traditionally have been supported by immigrant and ethnic groups. But with the election of a populist right-leaning mayor and shifting voter allegiances, Mr Ivison says the Liberals can no longer take ethnic and immigrant voters for granted. In particular, backing for the Conservatives' supportive Israel policy by the large Jewish communities in York Centre and Eglinton-Lawrence on the northern edge of Toronto could swing the vote, Mr Ivison says. Hockey schedule In addition, Canada's large Chinese community in Toronto and in Vancouver in the west is similarly impressed by Mr Harper's pro-business stance and his government's 2006 apology for a discriminatory head tax imposed on Chinese immigrants to Canada between 1885 and 1923, Mr Ivison says.

By Lee CarterBBC News, Toronto The issue has injected a spark of interest into a campaign many observers say has been lacklustre, as Canadian voters prepare to head wearily to the polls on 2 May for the fourth time in seven years. The election was triggered by a non-confidence vote in Canada's parliament, which came after Prime Minister Stephen Harper's minority government was criticised for failing to provide details about several controversial areas of spending, including the budget for new fighter jets. Spending questions seemed to dog Mr Harper's Conservatives again this week. A leaked auditor general's draft report on last summer's G8/G20 summit in Canada alleged the government spent millions of dollars on dubious projects and that parliament was \"misled\" about the spending. The Conservatives have dismissed the allegations, insisting that the final report will be less damning, and Auditor General Sheila Fraser has said she will not release the final report until after the new parliament is seated. Nevertheless, the controversy has put Mr Harper's campaign on the defensive heading into the debate. The leader of the main opposition Liberal Party, Michael Ignatieff, will almost certainly seize on the allegations to cast the Harper government as untrustworthy. Questions of honesty But Mr Ignatieff also has a lot to prove in the debates, as the only one of the four leaders fighting an election for the first time. And Conservative advertisements attacking the patriotism of the Liberal leader, who spent much of his career away from Canada, appear to have had some success. Despite an energetic campaign, the author and former political commentator has made little headway in opinion polls, with his party trailing the Conservatives by 8.5 points in a Nanos Research poll released on Tuesday. Allan Bonner, a Toronto-based political consultant, said Mr Ignatieff had to seize the opportunity in the debates to demonstrate that he has leadership qualities and to use the auditor general's report as a \"springboard\" to raise questions in voters' minds about the Conservatives' honesty and spending. \"He needs to show a broader performance, a deeper knowledge of the issues, maybe deliver some soaring rhetoric,\" Mr Bonner said. Buoyed by what Mr Bonner calls \"the power of incumbency\", the technocratic Mr Harper has run a cautious, tightly controlled campaign, promising to give a boost to retirement savings accounts and to eliminate the country's budget deficit by 2014. \"He's selling himself as a good and diligent but rather dour manager,\" Mr Bonner said. \"We have seen the range of emotions from Stephen Harper running all the way through from L to M in the alphabet and that's probably what we're going to see in the debate.\" Jockeying for position New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jack Layton and Gilles Duceppe, who heads the Quebec nationalist party Bloc Quebecois, will also be jockeying for position at the debates. Controversially, the Green Party, led by popular leader Elizabeth May, has been excluded from the forum. Mr Layton, who has recently recovered from a hip operation and a brush with cancer, has conducted a feisty and passionate campaign, promising among other things to secure long-term funding for the country's public healthcare system by increasing corporate taxes. But the latest polling by Nanos Research shows NDP support falling to 16.8% from a high of 19.9% on 15 March. National Post political columnist John Ivison said the Liberals were trying to take advantage of the crowded and divided opposition to attract leftist New Democrat voters. \"Their platform is becoming virtually identical to the NDP's,\" he said. \"There's a lot of promises of money for childcare, family care and post-secondary education - all the things NDP voters care about.\" Toronto swing Mr Ivison also said Canada's largest metropolitan area was a key battleground in the Conservatives' much-vaunted quest to form a majority, after heading a minority government since 2006. Toronto is the country's commercial and financial capital, with a diverse population of more than 5.1 million in the metropolitan area. The city has long been a stronghold for the federal Liberals, who traditionally have been supported by immigrant and ethnic groups. But with the election of a populist right-leaning mayor and shifting voter allegiances, Mr Ivison says the Liberals can no longer take ethnic and immigrant voters for granted. In particular, backing for the Conservatives' supportive Israel policy by the large Jewish communities in York Centre and Eglinton-Lawrence on the northern edge of Toronto could swing the vote, Mr Ivison says. Hockey schedule In addition, Canada's large Chinese community in Toronto and in Vancouver in the west is similarly impressed by Mr Harper's pro-business stance and his government's 2006 apology for a discriminatory head tax imposed on Chinese immigrants to Canada between 1885 and 1923, Mr Ivison says.

By George Greenwood and Laura Harmes 5 live Investigates In London, the figure has doubled since 2011-12. Some 103 London fire staff have taken mental health leave this year, some after working at Grenfell Tower. The Home Office said it was the responsibility of fire services to put wellbeing services in place. Two-thirds of fire services provided data following a Freedom of Information request submitted by 5 live Investigates. They reveal the number of firefighters and other staff taking long-term mental health leave rose from 600 to 780 over the last six years. At least 126 staff have left the service due to mental health issues since 2011. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service only provided comparable figures for one full year. In 2016-17, 97 Scottish fire staff took long-term mental health sick leave while in Northern Ireland that figure was 111. Andy Graham, 52, is a former firefighter, who served in the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. He has suffered from PTSD for the last 30 years. Mr Graham, who has a son and a daughter, retired last year and now trains others in mental health first aid. \"When I started in the fire service in 1987 there was no proper debriefing system in place,\" he explained. \"The first fatal incident I attended was a particularly traumatic suicide. \"Within a matter of weeks, I started suffering from nightmares and panic attacks, and it snowballed from there, after attending more fatal incidents.\" He said that he was afraid to go to bed at night because of the nightmares. \"It meant I started staying up late, drinking alcohol to help me sleep. \"Through the daytime, there would be triggers that would set me off having flashbacks and panic attacks. Those triggers were blue lights, sirens, loud bangs. Seeing certain situations being depicted on TV even would set me off.\" Suppressed issues His son, John, was only five when his father had a breakdown. \"It's horrible to bring it back, being so young and coming through the front door and seeing your dad lying on the couch with a blank look on his face, someone that you're so used to being bubbly and happy, and he doesn't even say hello to you.\" Andy explained that he tried to keep a lid on his issues for years. \"But they were always there, bubbling under the surface. When you're in the fire service, you're told that you're the strong one, the one there to help others. \"So it goes really against the grain to be asking for help. \"I've been in therapy four times now, and I'm in a better place than I have been for 29 years. \"Fire services have better debriefing systems than they used to, but the support is not where it needs to be yet.\" Richard Welch, London Fire Brigade commander for Lambeth said that following the incident at Grenfell Tower, 200 of their staff have received counselling - and that 80 were still seeing counsellors.

She said fire and rescue services had put a lot of work into ensuring help and support are available to staff and they were working hard to reduce the stigma around mental health issues. She added: \"The days following the Grenfell fire saw a lot of open discussion about support being made available to firefighters and firefighters openly discussing it.

Andy Graham, 52, is a former firefighter, who served in the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. He has suffered from PTSD for the last 30 years. Mr Graham, who has a son and a daughter, retired last year and now trains others in mental health first aid. \"When I started in the fire service in 1987 there was no proper debriefing system in place,\" he explained. \"The first fatal incident I attended was a particularly traumatic suicide. \"Within a matter of weeks, I started suffering from nightmares and panic attacks, and it snowballed from there, after attending more fatal incidents.\" He said that he was afraid to go to bed at night because of the nightmares. \"It meant I started staying up late, drinking alcohol to help me sleep. \"Through the daytime, there would be triggers that would set me off having flashbacks and panic attacks. Those triggers were blue lights, sirens, loud bangs. Seeing certain situations being depicted on TV even would set me off.\" Suppressed issues His son, John, was only five when his father had a breakdown. \"It's horrible to bring it back, being so young and coming through the front door and seeing your dad lying on the couch with a blank look on his face, someone that you're so used to being bubbly and happy, and he doesn't even say hello to you.\" Andy explained that he tried to keep a lid on his issues for years. \"But they were always there, bubbling under the surface.

It is a tragedy with a hint of sweetness - the two who lived each other's lives, end those lives together. By Stephen EvansBBC News And it is not uncommon. We do not know the cause of Debbie Reynolds' death but there are more instances of two people who love each other dying in short proximity than you might think. There are medical reasons why it is possible to die of a broken heart. I once went to the joint funeral in Wales of a couple who died within a week of each other. Then I read a report in the news about a man in California who died hours after his wife. It made me wonder how often this happens - and what could be the reason. In the first case, the widower selected a poem to be read at his wife's funeral - it talked of \"two lovers entwined\" and a journey \"to the end of time's end\". But before that funeral took place, the husband, Edmund Williams, also died. He and his wife, Margaret, had been married for 60 years and their love had endured. In their late 80s, they would still go into their garden holding hands. Parting broke his heart. And about the same time Don and Maxine Simpson died in Bakersfield in California. He was 90 and she was 87, and they were as inseparable as they had always been after meeting at a bowling alley in 1952 and marrying that same year. Maxine died first and four hours later, by her side, Don followed. It looks like a pattern, and perhaps it is. Research published two years ago in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine found that, while it happened rarely, the number of people who had a heart attack or a stroke in the month after a loved-one died was double that of a matched control group who were not grieving (50 out of 30,447 in the bereaved group, or 0.16%, compared with 67 out of 83,588 in the non-bereaved group, or 0.08%). One of the authors, Dr Sunil Shah of St George's at the University of London, told the BBC: \"We often use the term a 'broken heart' to signify the pain of losing a loved-one and our study shows that bereavement can have a direct effect on the health of the heart.\" Some people talk about \"broken heart syndrome\", known more formally as stress cardiomyopathy or takotsubo cardiomyopathy. According to the British Heart Foundation, it is a \"temporary condition where your heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or stunned. The left ventricle, one of the heart's chambers, changes shape.\" It can be brought on by a shock. \"About three quarters of people diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy have experienced significant emotional or physical stress prior to becoming unwell,\" the charity says. This stress might be bereavement but it could be a shock of another kind. There are documented cases of people suffering the condition after being frightened by colleagues pulling a prank, or suffering the stress of speaking to a large group of people. It's speculated that the sudden release of hormones - in particular, adrenaline - causes the stunning of the heart muscle. This is different from a heart attack, which is a stopping of the heart because the blood supply is constricted, perhaps by clogged arteries. \"Most heart attacks occur due to blockages and blood clots forming in the coronary arteries, the arteries that supply the heart with blood,\" says an FAQ on broken heart syndrome published by Johns Hopkins University. What becomes of the broken-hearted By contrast, most patients who suffer from cardiomyopathy \"have fairly normal coronary arteries and do not have severe blockages or clots\", the website says. Many people simply recover - the stress goes away and the heart returns to its normal shape. But in some, like the old or those with a heart condition, the change in the shape of the heart can prompt a fatal heart attack. The scientific name, takotsubo cardiomyopathy comes from the Japanese word for a type of round-bottomed, narrow-necked vessel used for catching octopuses. The sudden stress causes the left ventricle of the heart - the one that does the pumping - to balloon out into the shape of the pot. There is also evidence of an increased risk of death after the hospitalisation of a partner, according to a study published in 2006 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Other research published in 2011, meanwhile, suggests that the odds of the surviving partner dying are increased for six months after their partner's death. The researchers pointed out that a mutually supportive marriage acts as a buffer against stress. Partners also monitor each other and encourage healthy behaviour - reminding each other to take their daily tablets, for example, and checking they don't drink too much. Whatever the science behind \"broken heart syndrome\", the results are bitter-sweet. There is, of course, the grief of a bereaved family who have lost two people they love. But there is also often a relief that a couple deeply in love should have exited life together. Edmund Williams' poem for his wife Margaret talked about \"two lovers entwined\" and a journey \"to the end of time's end\". If there is a benevolent heart condition, surely takotsubo cardiomyopathy is the one - but \"dying of a broken heart\" puts it better. An earlier version of this feature appeared in August 2014.

By David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News The United Nations has published its first plan for managing the extraction of so-called \"nodules\" - small mineral-rich rocks - from the seabed. A technical study was carried out by the UN's International Seabed Authority - the body overseeing deep sea mining. It says companies could apply for licences from as soon as 2016. The idea of exploiting the gold, copper, manganese, cobalt and other metals of the ocean floor has been considered for decades but only recently became feasible with high commodity prices and new technology. Conservation experts have long warned that mining the seabed will be highly destructive and could have disastrous long-term consequences for marine life. The ISA study itself recognizes that mining will cause \"inevitable environmental damage\". But the report comes amid what a spokesman describes as \"an unprecedented surge\" of interest from state-owned and private mining companies. Sharing the proceeds The number of licences issued to prospect for minerals now stands at 17 with another seven due to be granted and more are likely to follow. They cover vast areas of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. One of the most recent to be granted was to UK Seabed Resources, a subsidiary of the British arm of Lockheed Martin, the American defence giant. Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the ISA was set up to encourage and manage seabed mining for the wider benefit of humanity - with a share of any profits going to developing countries. Now the ISA is taking the significant step of moving from simply handling bids for mineral exploration to considering how to license the first real mining operations and how to share the proceeds. The ISA's legal counsel, Michael Lodge, told the BBC: \"We are at the threshold of a new era of deep seabed mining.\" The lure is obvious. An assessment of the eastern Pacific - a five million sq km area known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone - concluded that more than 27 billion tonnes of nodules could be lying on the sand. Those rocks would contain a staggering seven billion tonnes of manganese, 340 million tonnes of nickel, 290 million tonnes of copper and 78 million tonnes of cobalt - although it's not known how much of this is accessible. A map shows the spread of licensed areas across the zone. Right incentives According to the planning study, the ISA faces the challenge of trying to ensure that nodule mining's benefits will reach beyond the companies themselves while also fostering commercially viable operations. The plan relies on providing operators with the right incentives to risk what would be expensive investments without losing the chance for developing countries to get a slice of the proceeds. But the ISA identifies what it calls a \"Catch-22\" in this brand new industry as it tries to assess which companies are skilled enough to carry out the work. \"Competence cannot be gained,\" it says, \"without actual mining at a commercial scale, but at the same time mining should not be allowed without prior demonstration of competence.\" A key factor in the ISA's thinking is the need for environmental safeguards, so the document calls for monitoring of the seabed during any mining operation - though critics wonder if activity in the ocean depths can be policed. The prospect of deep sea mining has already sparked a vigorous debate among marine scientists, as I found earlier this year on a visit to the British research ship, James Cook, exploring the hydrothermal vents of the Cayman Trough. The expedition's chief scientist, Dr Jon Copley, a biologist from the University of Southampton, urged caution. \"I don't think we own the deep ocean in the sense that we can do what we like with it,\" he said. \"Instead we share responsibility for its stewardship. \"We don't have a good track record of achieving balance anywhere else - think of the buffalo and the rainforest - so the question is, can we get it right?\" Extinction risk And Prof Paul Tyler, also a biologist, of the National Oceanography Centre, warned that unique species would be at risk. \"If you wipe out that area by mining, those animals have to do one of two things: they disperse and colonise another hydrothermal vent somewhere or they die. \"And what happens when they die is that the vent will become biologically extinct.\" However, marine chemist Prof Rachel Mills, of the University of Southampton, called for a wider debate about mining generally on the grounds that we all use minerals and that mines on land are far larger than any would be on the seabed. She has carried out research for Nautilus Minerals, a Canadian firm planning to mine hydrothermal vents off Papua New Guinea. \"Everything we are surrounded by, the way we live, relies on mineral resources and we don't often ask where they come from,\" she said. \"We need to ask whether there is sustainable mining on land and whether there is sustainable mining in the seas. \"I actually think it is the same moral questions we ask whether it's from the Andes or down in the Bismarck Sea.\" This debate is set to intensify as the reality of the first mining operations comes closer.

However, the environmental impact of deep sea mining is not yet known, and some scientists are concerned that it could damage delicate marine ecosystems.\n\n# Output (b):\nDeep sea mining has the potential to provide a wide range of benefits, including the extraction of gold, copper, manganese, cobalt and other metals from the ocean floor. An assessment of the eastern Pacific found that more than 27 billion tonnes of mineral-rich rocks, containing seven billion tonnes of manganese, 340 million tonnes of nickel, 290 million tonnes of copper and 78 million tonnes of cobalt, could be lying on the seabed. The United Nations has published its first plan for managing the extraction of these minerals, and companies could apply for licences from as soon as 2016.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nExplanation:\nOutput (a) provides a more detailed summary of the metals that can be extracted from deep sea mining, including their quantities. It also mentions the potential environmental impact of deep sea mining, which is a concern for marine scientists.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nExplanation:\nOutput (a) provides a general overview of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It also mentions the concerns of marine scientists regarding the environmental impact of deep sea mining.\n\nOutput (b) provides a more specific summary of the potential benefits of deep sea mining, including the types and quantities of metals that can be extracted. It also mentions the UN's plan for managing the extraction of these minerals and the potential for companies to apply for licences from 2016.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

By David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News The United Nations has published its first plan for managing the extraction of so-called \"nodules\" - small mineral-rich rocks - from the seabed. A technical study was carried out by the UN's International Seabed Authority - the body overseeing deep sea mining. It says companies could apply for licences from as soon as 2016. The idea of exploiting the gold, copper, manganese, cobalt and other metals of the ocean floor has been considered for decades but only recently became feasible with high commodity prices and new technology. Conservation experts have long warned that mining the seabed will be highly destructive and could have disastrous long-term consequences for marine life. The ISA study itself recognizes that mining will cause \"inevitable environmental damage\". But the report comes amid what a spokesman describes as \"an unprecedented surge\" of interest from state-owned and private mining companies. Sharing the proceeds The number of licences issued to prospect for minerals now stands at 17 with another seven due to be granted and more are likely to follow. They cover vast areas of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. One of the most recent to be granted was to UK Seabed Resources, a subsidiary of the British arm of Lockheed Martin, the American defence giant. Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the ISA was set up to encourage and manage seabed mining for the wider benefit of humanity - with a share of any profits going to developing countries. Now the ISA is taking the significant step of moving from simply handling bids for mineral exploration to considering how to license the first real mining operations and how to share the proceeds. The ISA's legal counsel, Michael Lodge, told the BBC: \"We are at the threshold of a new era of deep seabed mining.\" The lure is obvious. An assessment of the eastern Pacific - a five million sq km area known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone - concluded that more than 27 billion tonnes of nodules could be lying on the sand. Those rocks would contain a staggering seven billion tonnes of manganese, 340 million tonnes of nickel, 290 million tonnes of copper and 78 million tonnes of cobalt - although it's not known how much of this is accessible. A map shows the spread of licensed areas across the zone. Right incentives According to the planning study, the ISA faces the challenge of trying to ensure that nodule mining's benefits will reach beyond the companies themselves while also fostering commercially viable operations. The plan relies on providing operators with the right incentives to risk what would be expensive investments without losing the chance for developing countries to get a slice of the proceeds. But the ISA identifies what it calls a \"Catch-22\" in this brand new industry as it tries to assess which companies are skilled enough to carry out the work. \"Competence cannot be gained,\" it says, \"without actual mining at a commercial scale, but at the same time mining should not be allowed without prior demonstration of competence.\" A key factor in the ISA's thinking is the need for environmental safeguards, so the document calls for monitoring of the seabed during any mining operation - though critics wonder if activity in the ocean depths can be policed. The prospect of deep sea mining has already sparked a vigorous debate among marine scientists, as I found earlier this year on a visit to the British research ship, James Cook, exploring the hydrothermal vents of the Cayman Trough. The expedition's chief scientist, Dr Jon Copley, a biologist from the University of Southampton, urged caution. \"I don't think we own the deep ocean in the sense that we can do what we like with it,\" he said. \"Instead we share responsibility for its stewardship. \"We don't have a good track record of achieving balance anywhere else - think of the buffalo and the rainforest - so the question is, can we get it right?\" Extinction risk And Prof Paul Tyler, also a biologist, of the National Oceanography Centre, warned that unique species would be at risk. \"If you wipe out that area by mining, those animals have to do one of two things: they disperse and colonise another hydrothermal vent somewhere or they die. \"And what happens when they die is that the vent will become biologically extinct.\" However, marine chemist Prof Rachel Mills, of the University of Southampton, called for a wider debate about mining generally on the grounds that we all use minerals and that mines on land are far larger than any would be on the seabed. She has carried out research for Nautilus Minerals, a Canadian firm planning to mine hydrothermal vents off Papua New Guinea. \"Everything we are surrounded by, the way we live, relies on mineral resources and we don't often ask where they come from,\" she said. \"We need to ask whether there is sustainable mining on land and whether there is sustainable mining in the seas. \"I actually think it is the same moral questions we ask whether it's from the Andes or down in the Bismarck Sea.\" This debate is set to intensify as the reality of the first mining operations comes closer.

By David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News The United Nations has published its first plan for managing the extraction of so-called \"nodules\" - small mineral-rich rocks - from the seabed. A technical study was carried out by the UN's International Seabed Authority - the body overseeing deep sea mining. It says companies could apply for licences from as soon as 2016. The idea of exploiting the gold, copper, manganese, cobalt and other metals of the ocean floor has been considered for decades but only recently became feasible with high commodity prices and new technology. Conservation experts have long warned that mining the seabed will be highly destructive and could have disastrous long-term consequences for marine life. The ISA study itself recognizes that mining will cause \"inevitable environmental damage\". But the report comes amid what a spokesman describes as \"an unprecedented surge\" of interest from state-owned and private mining companies. Sharing the proceeds The number of licences issued to prospect for minerals now stands at 17 with another seven due to be granted and more are likely to follow. They cover vast areas of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. One of the most recent to be granted was to UK Seabed Resources, a subsidiary of the British arm of Lockheed Martin, the American defence giant. Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the ISA was set up to encourage and manage seabed mining for the wider benefit of humanity - with a share of any profits going to developing countries. Now the ISA is taking the significant step of moving from simply handling bids for mineral exploration to considering how to license the first real mining operations and how to share the proceeds. The ISA's legal counsel, Michael Lodge, told the BBC: \"We are at the threshold of a new era of deep seabed mining.\" The lure is obvious. An assessment of the eastern Pacific - a five million sq km area known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone - concluded that more than 27 billion tonnes of nodules could be lying on the sand. Those rocks would contain a staggering seven billion tonnes of manganese, 340 million tonnes of nickel, 290 million tonnes of copper and 78 million tonnes of cobalt - although it's not known how much of this is accessible. A map shows the spread of licensed areas across the zone. Right incentives According to the planning study, the ISA faces the challenge of trying to ensure that nodule mining's benefits will reach beyond the companies themselves while also fostering commercially viable operations. The plan relies on providing operators with the right incentives to risk what would be expensive investments without losing the chance for developing countries to get a slice of the proceeds. But the ISA identifies what it calls a \"Catch-22\" in this brand new industry as it tries to assess which companies are skilled enough to carry out the work. \"Competence cannot be gained,\" it says, \"without actual mining at a commercial scale, but at the same time mining should not be allowed without prior demonstration of competence.\" A key factor in the ISA's thinking is the need for environmental safeguards, so the document calls for monitoring of the seabed during any mining operation - though critics wonder if activity in the ocean depths can be policed. The prospect of deep sea mining has already sparked a vigorous debate among marine scientists, as I found earlier this year on a visit to the British research ship, James Cook, exploring the hydrothermal vents of the Cayman Trough. The expedition's chief scientist, Dr Jon Copley, a biologist from the University of Southampton, urged caution. \"I don't think we own the deep ocean in the sense that we can do what we like with it,\" he said. \"Instead we share responsibility for its stewardship. \"We don't have a good track record of achieving balance anywhere else - think of the buffalo and the rainforest - so the question is, can we get it right?\" Extinction risk And Prof Paul Tyler, also a biologist, of the National Oceanography Centre, warned that unique species would be at risk. \"If you wipe out that area by mining, those animals have to do one of two things: they disperse and colonise another hydrothermal vent somewhere or they die. \"And what happens when they die is that the vent will become biologically extinct.\" However, marine chemist Prof Rachel Mills, of the University of Southampton, called for a wider debate about mining generally on the grounds that we all use minerals and that mines on land are far larger than any would be on the seabed. She has carried out research for Nautilus Minerals, a Canadian firm planning to mine hydrothermal vents off Papua New Guinea. \"Everything we are surrounded by, the way we live, relies on mineral resources and we don't often ask where they come from,\" she said. \"We need to ask whether there is sustainable mining on land and whether there is sustainable mining in the seas. \"I actually think it is the same moral questions we ask whether it's from the Andes or down in the Bismarck Sea.\" This debate is set to intensify as the reality of the first mining operations comes closer.
