{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nSummarize the following content.\n\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years. We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\nHer visa to stay here is coming to an end later this year, then she will be forced to return to Malaysia despite opting to stay here if she had the choice. We have gone down the job route, to the point that she was offered the job here, but the employer failed to get a license to issue Visas on very petty grounds.\nI (and others) have suggested getting married. It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years. We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\n\n# Output (a):\nMy girlfriend's visa to stay in the UK expires in a few months, and she wants to stay here, but she won't get married until she goes back to Malaysia.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is more fluent and well-structured, presenting the key information in a clear and concise manner. Output (b) is too brief and lacks context.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more relevant information, such as the reason for the girlfriend's reluctance to get married and the urgency of the visa situation. Output (b) omits important details.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs fail to infer the user's intention, which is to seek advice or a new perspective on the situation. However, Output (a) better captures the essence of the problem.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately convey the main issue, which is the visa expiration and the girlfriend's stance on marriage.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) more closely follows the instruction by summarizing the main points of the content, while Output (b) is too succinct and misses crucial details.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it maintains the text quality, provides more relevant information, and more accurately captures the essence of the situation, even though both fail to infer the user's intention.

We have gone down the job route, to the point that she was offered the job here, but the employer failed to get a license to issue Visas on very petty grounds.\nI (and others) have suggested getting married. It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?", "winner": 1, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

He says he hates talk on the phone and when I call him, he has nothing to say and sounds bored. I offered to video chat or something, but he doesn't want to try. \nWe don't see each other often, so we end up going long periods of time without seeing or hearing each other, only texting. I feel no connection when we text. He sees no problem with this. Am I wrong to be annoyed?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend only likes to text me for shallow conversation. I want deeper and intellectually stimulating conversations. Am I wrong to be annoyed?\n\n# Output (a):\nBoyfriend only likes to talk through text. He sees no issue with it.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nComplete a brief story given the following first sentence.\n\nOne day my wife and I were on the bench in front of our building.\n\n# Output (b):\nWe were expecting a refund. the next week, the store had an iPad.

I am looking to write a sci-fi story. The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

Output (b) offers a more scientific explanation, discussing the gravitational potential well and its impact on space flight.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) addresses the user's intention to create a sci-fi story by suggesting interesting plot elements. Output (b) provides a more technical answer, which might not directly align with the creative aspect of the story.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their respective domains.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs address the main question, but Output (a) offers a broader perspective on the civilization's technological advancements, while Output (b) focuses on the physics aspect.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it more closely aligns with the creative context of a sci-fi story, providing imaginative ideas that can enrich the plot.

Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.

A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).", "instruction": "is it possible for a planet to have life, but lack the resources for achieving space flight?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her? Again, sorry for my bad english =/\n\n# Output (b):\nI want to give some advice to my 17-year-old sister to avoid risky situations while drunk, without instilling rape fear or guilt in her. How would you advise me to phrase my advice?\n\n# Output (a):\nI want to tell my sister that she should avoid getting drunk with people she doesn't know or trust to avoid drowning risk, but I also want to make her aware that rape fear is a serious issue.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (b) is more fluent and well-structured, with proper grammar and a clear, concise statement of the issue at hand. Output (a) is less coherent and has a fragmented structure.\n\n2.

User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) accurately captures the user's intention to give advice to their sister in a sensitive manner, while Output (a) omits the part about not wanting to contribute to rape culture.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in conveying the user's desire to give advice to their sister about risky situations, but Output (b) is more precise in its wording.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) more closely follows the instruction by summarizing the main concern of the user, while Output (a) includes additional details that might not be essential for a summary.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it presents a clearer and more concise summary of the user's intention, focusing on the delicate balance of giving advice without promoting fear or guilt.

Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nExplain: Pathos, Ethos, Logos \n\n# Output (b):\nPathos is a tool of persuasion that is used to appeal to readers' emotions by arousing positive or negative feelings. It can be used in rhetoric, literature, film, and other forms of expression. While pathos is used to draw an emotional response, the other rhetorical appeals appeal to credibility and logic, respectively. Ethos is the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution. It is often evident as facts, numbers, or statistics and is used to convince an audience of an argument.\n\n# Output (a):\nEthos is the ethical appeal, which is used to convince an audience of the author's credibility or character. Pathos is the emotional appeal, which is used to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions. Logos is the appeal to logic and is used to convince an audience by the use of logic and reason.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

At the first bus stop, half of the people got down and 4 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal? \n\n# Output (b):\nLet's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. \n\nAt the first stop, half of the people got down, so there were x/2 people left on the bus. Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured, fluent, and free of errors. Output (b) uses algebraic notation, which might be more formal and precise, while Output (a) uses plain language, making it potentially more accessible to a wider audience.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides a detailed step-by-step explanation using algebra, which demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem-solving process. Output (a) also provides a step-by-step explanation but omits the algebra, instead opting for a more straightforward narrative.\n\n3.

Output (a) uses simpler language, which could be more suitable for a general audience. Considering the context, if the instruction is for a math problem solving scenario, Output (b) is better due to its algebraic explanation. However, if the instruction is for a more general audience, Output (a) might be more appropriate.\n\nSince the instruction doesn't specify the target audience, I will base the decision on the completeness of the solution.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

We decided to do some things about it. We cleaned the puddle up afterward.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here? I don't really know anything about finance, or what's actually going on. I really want to help my parents, but at the same time I have to protect myself too.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy mom asked me to hide her \u20ac12,000 savings from the bank so that the bank doesn't know about it. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Output (a):\nI'm a student in Ireland. I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) better captures the user's concern about the legality of the situation, while Output (a) misses this crucial aspect.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in the information they present, but Output (b) is more precise in addressing the user's worry.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) follows the instruction more closely by summarizing the main concern, while Output (a) includes additional details that are not essential to the summary.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it effectively captures the essence of the user's question and concern, while being concise and well-structured.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster. Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

The choice between the two could be subjective, but considering the medieval context and the grandeur of a royal banquet, Output (a) seems to better capture the atmosphere.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -5.483612312673358e-06}, {".": -5.722029527532868e-06}, {" Text": -7.033323527139146e-06}, {" Quality": -0.00010334911348763853}, {":\n": -0.22541947662830353}, {"Both":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

I am now doing a short internship abroad for 3 months, and he is planning on visiting. Should I tell my parents about this visit, especially if it will upset them greatly and disapprove of our decision to get more 'serious'?

User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nComplete a brief story given the following first sentence: We went to a dinner and show one night.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere were just six people at the dinner. The show's DJ was very inviting, but only for one person. He played a duet with a few other people. It ended up being good.\n\n# Output (a):\nWe left the fridge to get to make him think he would not. He laughed when he said he might buy a pizza. We went to the right nearby place. He had won the contest and enjoyed dinner.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (b) has a more coherent structure and flows better than Output (a), which seems to jump between unrelated ideas.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides details about the dinner and the show, while Output (a) introduces a confusing narrative about a fridge, a pizza, and a contest, which is not directly related to the initial sentence.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to continue a brief story, and Output (b) does this more effectively by describing the dinner and the show, which aligns with the given first sentence.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are fictional stories, so accuracy is not a critical criterion in this context. However, Output (b) presents a more plausible scenario than Output (a), which seems disjointed.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs complete the task of continuing the story, but Output (b) does so in a more relevant and coherent manner.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it more closely follows the instruction by providing a coherent and relevant continuation of the story, while Output (a) introduces unrelated elements and lacks clarity. Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -5.364403477869928e-06}, {".": -3.814689989667386e-06}, {" Text": -2.861018856492592e-06}, {" Quality": -5.173549288883805e-05}, {":\n":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

We have been in a relationship for 2 years and have been best friends for 2 before that. He loves always having plans and hanging out with people, which I also sometimes enjoy doing but I also need nights where we can just stay in and watch movies or do nothing. Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns. How do I get him to see my point of view?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend is an extrovert and loves to hang out with friends, I am an introvert and need nights alone to relax. He doesn't understand my need for a night in, and it puts me under stress. How do I get him to understand?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy boyfriend and I are always busy and I need a night in. He thinks I'm being lazy and doesn't understand why I need a night in.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are fluent and well-structured, with no grammatical or spelling errors.

Output (a) omits the part about being best friends for two years and the boyfriend's extroverted nature, which are important context.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs infer the user's intention to seek advice on how to communicate their need for downtime to their partner. Output (b) does this more effectively by summarizing the issue in a concise manner.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately capture the essence of the original content, though Output (b) is more precise in reflecting the user's feelings and the issue at hand.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs summarize the content while keeping the main points, as instructed. Output (b) covers more aspects of the original content, making it a more complete summary.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it provides a more comprehensive summary, retaining important context and the user's feelings, while still being concise.

This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training. Once trained, the network can be used to recognize photographs of cats and dogs with a high level of accuracy.\n\n# Output (a):\nSure! Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nExplain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\n# Output (b):\nSelf-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end.

In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction asks for a new sentence combining the two given sentences with a correct relationship. Both outputs achieve this, but Output (a) more accurately reflects the intended relationship between the actions, as excitement is a likely cause for jumping up and down.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in terms of grammar and sentence construction.\n\n5.

Output (b) introduces an unnecessary contrast with the use of \"but,\" which implies a conflict between the actions that doesn't exist in the original sentences.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.",

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction asks for a concise rewrite, so both outputs infer the user's intention to shorten the sentence.\n\n4.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) directly provides the converted date, which is the information asked for in the instruction.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, and both outputs address it directly.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) accurately converts the date, while Output (a) provides an accurate but incomplete statement about the difference between the two calendars.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) fully completes the instruction by providing the converted date, while Output (a) does not.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is more helpful and directly fulfills the instruction by providing the exact Julian calendar date.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. Output (b) is a complete function, while Output (a) is a code snippet that lacks a function definition.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) is more informative as it provides a complete function to generate an array of random numbers, including the necessary import statement for the random module, which is not present in Output (a).\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) directly addresses the instruction by creating a function that generates an array of random numbers. Output (a) only populates an array with numbers from 1 to 100 but does not include randomness.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) is accurate in generating random numbers between 1 and 100, whereas Output (a) simply appends all numbers from 1 to 100 in sequence.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) fully follows the instruction by creating a function that generates an array of random numbers, while Output (a) only partially fulfills the task by creating an array with a sequence of numbers.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it provides a complete and accurate function that directly addresses the instruction to generate an array of

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

It could also be a sudden break-up with a partner or a death in the family. Other common triggers are feeling left out or neglected by friends, or feeling isolated and alone.\n\n# Output (a):\nA hypothetical situation in which someone is feeling sad could be that of a teenage girl who has just moved to a new city and is finding it hard to make friends. She is lonely and homesick and feels like no one understands her. She is having a hard time adjusting to her new surroundings and is feeling down in the dumps.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGive a helpful response to the following statement: My bag is lost.\n\n# Output (b):\nI'm sorry to hear about your loss.\n\n# Output (a):\nI'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried searching for it or notified authorities like the police?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) infers the user might need guidance or assistance in dealing with the lost bag, while Output (b) does not infer any further intentions.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth responses are accurate in addressing the situation.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction is open-ended, but Output (a) provides more relevant and helpful information to the user's situation.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is more helpful as it not only expresses sympathy but also suggests potential next steps for the user to take.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

The items are then sorted based on the values returned by this function.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to define a key for sorting. It is used to tell the function how to compare two strings to determine which one should be placed before the other in the sorted output.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides a more detailed explanation of the `key` argument, mentioning that it is a function of one argument used to extract a comparison key, while Output (a) only explains it as a way to define a key for sorting without elaborating on its function.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in describing the purpose of the `key` argument.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs directly answer the question without omitting any key information.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it offers a more comprehensive

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs have good text quality, with fluent and well-structured sentences. They are free of spelling and grammatical errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) is more informative as it incorporates two parameters, 'name' and 'surname', to personalize the greeting, which is more detailed than Output (a) that only uses one parameter 'name'.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction asks to modify the function to accept and use two parameters. Output (b) accurately infers this intention by adding 'surname' as a second parameter, while Output (a) only adds one additional parameter, 'customer', which might not align with the expected use of a second personal identifier.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) accurately follows the instruction by using two parameters in the greeting, making it more accurate than Output (a) which only uses one.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) fully completes the instruction by accepting and using two parameters, while Output (a) only partially completes it by using one additional parameter that doesn't match the expected context.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it more closely follows the instruction by incorporating two parameters, 'name' and 'surname', which is more relevant to the task of personalizing a greeting. Output (a) only partially fulfills the instruction and its use of 'customer' as a parameter is less suitable for the context.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are grammatically correct and well-structured, but Output (a) has a more neutral tone, which aligns better with the requirement to reduce clickbait.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither output provides additional information, as they are both headlines. However, Output (a) implies a more practical and realistic approach, which could be seen as more informative in the context of reducing clickbait.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, and both outputs attempt to rephrase the original clickbait headline. Output (a) directly addresses the need to generate a less sensational headline.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth headlines are accurate in the sense that they convey the idea of a life-changing discovery or action. Output (a) is less hyperbolic, which aligns better with the instruction.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction by creating a new headline, but Output (a) more effectively reduces the clickbait nature of the original headline.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it presents a more modest and genuine headline, which is less likely to be perceived as clickbait compared to Output (b), which still has a sense of exaggeration and urgency.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nConstruct a sentence using the words \"effervescence\", \"hesitant\" and \"integrity\".\n\n# Output (b):\nThe hesitant effervescence of his words gave away his integrity.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe effervescence in the room helped to ease the hesitant nature of the individual.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs have well-structured sentences with proper grammar and no spelling errors. Output (b) has a more poetic and nuanced construction, while Output (a) is more straightforward.\n\n2.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to create a sentence using the given words, and both outputs fulfill this requirement without needing to infer any additional context.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth sentences are accurate in their use of the words \"effervescence\", \"hesitant\", and \"integrity\".\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs precisely follow the instruction by incorporating all three words into a single sentence.\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\nOutput (b) demonstrates a more creative and subtle connection between the words, suggesting a deeper meaning behind the hesitant effervescence revealing someone's integrity.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWrite an SQL query to find all words that start with the letter 'd'.\n\n# Output (b):\nSELECT word FROM table WHERE word LIKE 'd%';\n\n# Output (a):\nSELECT word FROM words WHERE word = 'd';\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. They are concise and coherent.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither Output (a) nor Output (b) provides additional information beyond what is required by the instruction, as they are both SQL queries designed to fulfill a specific task.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the instruction, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) is accurate as it uses the 'LIKE' operator with the pattern 'd%', which will match all words starting with 'd'. Output (a), on the other hand, is not accurate because it only matches the exact word 'd'.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction by selecting the 'word' column from a table. However, Output (b) correctly implements the condition to find words starting with 'd', while Output (a) fails to do so.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is more accurate in fulfilling the instruction to find all words starting with 'd'.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nDetermine the most common word in the text. Humans are created in the image of God, from a spiritual perspective and from a physical perspective.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe most common word in the text is \"humans\", which appears twice.\n\n# Output (a):\n\"from\", \"a\", and \"perspective\"\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs directly answer the question, so no inference is needed.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) accurately identifies the most common word, while Output (a) lists words without indicating their frequency or relevance.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) fully addresses the instruction by identifying the most common word, while Output (a) only lists some words without specifying which is the most common.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it accurately and clearly provides the information requested in the instruction, while Output (a) lacks context and fails to specify the most common word.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nRead the following sentence and suggest one correction.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, and both outputs directly address the issue by suggesting a correction.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately identify the error and provide a correct solution.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs precisely execute the instruction by suggesting a single, correct correction.\n\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) effectively fulfill the task, but Output (a) directly provides the corrected sentence, which is more helpful for the user who might need the corrected version for immediate use.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nDescribe the look and feel of an ideal website.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe ideal website content should be engaging, relevant, and tailored to the intended audience. It should offer high-quality, original information that is regularly updated to remain current. Multimedia elements like images, videos, and infographics should complement the text to enhance understanding and retain user interest. Clear, concise language and well-structured formatting, including short paragraphs, bullet points, and subheadings, make the content easily digestible. Above all, the content should provide genuine value to the user, addressing their needs or queries while maintaining authenticity and credibility.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe ideal website should have a clean, modern, and visually appealing look. It should have a well-organized layout with a consistent color scheme that aligns with the brand's identity. The website should also have a responsive design, meaning it should look good and function well on all devices.\n\nIn terms of feel, the website should be user-friendly and intuitive. The website should also make users feel secure, especially if they're required to enter personal information or make a purchase.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (b) has a more coherent and well-structured flow of ideas, with a clear introduction and a logical progression of points.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides a more comprehensive view of the ideal website, including content quality, multimedia elements, and language considerations. Output (a) covers the design aspects but lacks the depth of Output (b).\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs address the instruction directly without needing to infer additional user intentions.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in describing the characteristics of an ideal website.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs cover different aspects of the instruction, with Output (a) focusing on design and user experience, and Output (b) on content and multimedia. Neither omits any key aspects, but Output (b) provides a more complete picture by combining both design and content aspects.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it offers a more holistic view of the ideal website, covering both design and content aspects, which are equally important for user experience and engagement.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nClassify the following list as either a positive or negative emotion:  amazed, joyful, scared, excited\n\n# Output (b):\nAmazed, joyful, and excited all have positive sentiments.\n\n# Output (a):\nAmazed - Positive, Joyful - Positive, Scared - Negative, Excited - Positive.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) accurately classifies all emotions, while Output (b) omits the classification for 'scared', which can be either positive or negative depending on the context.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) completely follows the instruction by classifying all emotions in the list, while Output (b) does not.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is more comprehensive and accurate in fulfilling the instruction by providing a classification for each emotion.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nDescribe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.\n\n# Output (b):\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are well-structured, fluent, and free of errors. Output (b) provides a more coherent comparison by presenting the differences in a clear, point-by-point format.\n\n2.

User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs directly address the user's intention to understand the differences between Shakespearean and modern English.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their descriptions of the differences.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs successfully describe the differences and provide examples, fulfilling the instruction.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it not only

The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.", "output_2": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"", "instruction": "Describe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWhich word does not belong to others?\n\nInch\nKilogram\nCentimeter\nYard\n\n# Output (b):\nKilogram\n\n# Output (a):\nThe word that does not belong to others is \"Inch\".\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are fluent, well-structured, and free of errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs are concise and directly answer the question, so there is no need for additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) correctly identifies \"Kilogram\" as the word that does not belong since it is a unit of mass, while the others are units of length.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs precisely execute the instruction by providing the expected answer.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is more accurate in fulfilling the instruction as it correctly identifies the word that does not belong to the group of units of length. However, Output (a) provides a brief explanation, which might be helpful for some users to understand the reason behind the answer. In this context, accuracy is more critical than the explanation, as the instruction simply asks for the word that does not belong.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

These reshaped the political and social structure of the globe.\"\n\n# Output (b):\nThe dates mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n- January 1, 1901\n- December 31, 2000\n\n# Output (a):\nThe dates of the 20th century are 1901-2000.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are fluent and well-structured, with no grammatical or spelling errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) is more informative as it explicitly lists the specific dates mentioned in the paragraph, while Output (a) only provides the range of years.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction asks for the extraction of dates, and Output (b) directly answers this by providing the exact dates, demonstrating a better understanding of the user's intention.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate, as they correctly identify the dates or the time frame of the 20th century.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) more completely follows the instruction by extracting the specific dates requested, while Output (a) only provides the century's start and end years.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it directly fulfills the instruction by extracting the exact dates from the paragraph, providing more detailed information than Output (a).

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.", "output_2": "Oh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit?

Maybe submitting a claim would get their attention?", "instruction": "Provide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nSon has a peanut allergy, and the school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts. This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3.

The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nDo you know of anyone who was unable to become an engineer despite getting the degree and their best efforts? Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (b) is well-structured, coherent, and free of errors, while Output (a) is less formal and contains a colloquial tone.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more detailed and practical advice, such as networking, skill enhancement, and considering the pros and cons of a CAD operator position. Output (a) focuses on the interview process but lacks the depth and breadth of advice provided in Output (b).\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs infer the user's intention to seek guidance in their engineering career, but Output (b) offers a broader range of suggestions, addressing the user's concerns more comprehensively.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their advice, but Output (b) is more relevant to the user's situation, as it directly addresses the challenges of transitioning into an engineering role.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs fulfill the instruction by providing advice, but Output (b) is more comprehensive and covers multiple aspects of the user's situation.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it offers a more well-rounded and detailed response, addressing the user's concerns about finding an engineering position, skill development, and the potential of taking a non-engineering role. Output (b) provides more actionable steps and insights, making it more helpful for the user.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -9.536697689327411e-06}, {".":

Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Describe the background image, text positions, text contents, etc.\n\n# Output (b):\nSave Energy: Unplug unwanted electronics. Use energy-saving bulbs. Use natural light whenever possible. Turn off electronics and appliances when not in use. Turn down the thermostat a few degrees. The poster aims to quickly convey the message that individual actions to save electricity today contribute to a brighter and sustainable future for everyone. The split image visually contrasts the choices we make now with the positive outcomes we can achieve. Remember, a successful poster communicates the message clearly and concisely while capturing the viewer's attention. The \"Brighten Tomorrow, Conserve Today\" concept emphasizes the urgency and rewards of energy conservation in a visually impactful way.\n\n# Output (a):\nPoster: Save Electricity, Illuminate Tomorrow**\n\n**Background Image:**\nThe background image depicts a serene and beautiful planet Earth seen from space, with a bright, radiant sun on one side symbolizing energy. The Earth is surrounded by a gentle glow, emphasizing the importance of preserving our planet's resources.\n\n**Text Positions:**\n1. **Title:** Centered at the top of the poster in bold and vibrant letters:\n   \"Save Electricity, Illuminate Tomorrow\"\n\n2. **Slogan:** Just below the title, in a slightly smaller font:\n   \"Empower Change, Conserve Energy\"\n\n3. **Main Message:** Positioned in the middle of the poster, in a larger font:\n   \"Join the Movement! Be a Watt-saver.\"\n\n4. **Tips for Saving Electricity:** Aligned horizontally across the bottom of the poster, each tip bulleted:\n   - \"Switch off lights when not in use.\"\n   - \"Unplug chargers to prevent energy wastage.\"\n   - \"Use energy-efficient appliances.\"\n   - \"Opt for natural light during the day.\"\n\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs fulfill the basic instruction of combining the words, but Output (b) goes a step further by providing a context, which could be inferred as the user wanting an example of how the words can be used together.\n\n4.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWhat is an antonym for the word \"cogent\"?\n\n# Output (b):\nunconvincing\n\n# Output (a):\nThe antonym of the word \"cogent\" is \"irrelevant\".\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Output (a) also provides a single-word antonym but adds an unnecessary and incorrect explanation, \"irrelevant\".\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, and both outputs address it directly.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) is accurate as \"unconvincing\" is a valid antonym for \"cogent\". Output (a) is not entirely accurate, as \"irrelevant\" is not an antonym for \"cogent\"; it's more of a contrast in relevance rather than a direct opposite in persuasiveness.\n\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Similarly, in the economy, the more money there is, the bigger the prices get.\n\n# Output (a):\nInflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. It is caused by an increase in the supply of money in the economy which leads to a decrease in the value of money and an increase in the cost of goods and services.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction doesn't specify whether the user is interested in the origin or the contemporary usage of the phrase. Output (b) offers historical context, which could be inferred as the user's intention if they are unfamiliar with the phrase's origin.\n\n4.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs are short and grammatically correct.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nThe outputs are concise, but the instruction only asks for a detection of whether the number is prime or not, so additional information is not necessary.\n\n3.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, a neural network can be used to tell you if an image is showing a cat or a dog. What are the basic mathematical requirements needed to get into neural networks? Please give me the basic requirements as completely as possible. Note that I don't mean to be an expert but a good AI engineer.\n\n# Output (b):\nGenerally, you should have a good understanding of:\n- linear algebra, especially of matrix operations\n- calculus, including computing derivatives\n- probabilities and statistics\n\n# Output (a):\nHaving a basic understanding of the math behind neural networks is really important to understand how they work in case you need to debug or optimize your algorithm. It would be better to have a good understanding of some mathematics topics:\n\n1. Numbers and counting: Numbers can be thought of as the building blocks of mathematics. There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events. It is a way pivotal part of many areas of mathematics, science, technology, and more. It is also helpful for simply interacting with other people and the world around us. Everyday examples of measurements include height, weight, temperature, and distance.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, and both outputs have fulfilled it by providing a suitable synonym.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth \"charitable\" and \"bountiful\" are synonyms for \"generous,\" so both Output (a) and Output (b) are accurate.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs have precisely followed the instruction by replacing the word in brackets with a synonym.\n\nIn this case, the decision comes down to which synonym

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nAnalyze given speech for sentiment:\nI'm so grateful for the help and support that I received from my family.\n\n# Output (b):\nPositive sentiment.\n\n# Output (a):\nNegative sentiment\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, and both outputs directly address the sentiment analysis task.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) is accurate in identifying the positive sentiment expressed in the speech, while Output (a) is inaccurate.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction by providing a sentiment analysis, but Output (b) provides the correct sentiment.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it accurately identifies the sentiment in the speech, which is the primary objective of the task.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) directly follows the instruction by providing the day of the week for the given date. Output (b) goes a step further by creating a reusable function, which might not have been explicitly asked for.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it provides a more versatile solution, allowing the user to determine the day of the week for any date by calling the function. Output (a) is more direct but less reusable. Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -6.079655122448457e-06}, {".": -7.629365427419543e-06}, {" Text": -2.861018856492592e-06}, {" Quality": -3.766942609217949e-05}, {":\n":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3.

This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

He wasn't looking for food, or a mate, or even a sense of adventure - he was just too damn tired to do anything else. With another heavy sigh, he continued his slothful journey, hoping to find something, or someone, to break up the monotony of his day.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nReformat the sentence so it is a question: I was surprised by the outcome.\n\n# Output (b):\nWhat was most surprising was the outcome.\n\n# Output (a):\nWhat surprised you about the outcome?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, which is to transform the statement into a question. Both outputs accomplish this task.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately rephrase the original sentence into a question form.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction precisely by converting the statement into a question.\n\nOverall, both Output (a) and Output (b) are equally effective in fulfilling the task. However, Output (a) directly asks for the subject's personal surprise, which may be more engaging in a conversation, while Output (b) emphasizes the surprising nature of the outcome. The choice between the two might depend on the context in which the question is being used.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Output (a) simply gives the number without any additional context.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear in the instruction, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate, as 5 is indeed the smallest positive integer divisible by 5.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs precisely answer the question asked by the instruction.\n\nOverall, Output (b) provides a more informative and complete answer by explicitly stating the fact that 15 is the smallest positive integer divisible by 5.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) more closely follows the instruction by describing the plumbing connections in natural language, while Output (a) only partially fulfills the task by

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Provide three example sentences that use the word \u201credundant\u201d.\n\n# Output (a):\nSentence 1: The amount of money he was given was redundant as he had already received the maximum amount allowed. \nSentence 2: His constant complaining was highly redundant as nothing ever changed. \nSentence 3: All the unnecessary details in the report were redundant and quite exhausting to read.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) directly addresses the user's request by providing relevant examples. Output (b) does not infer the user's intention and instead repeats parts of the instruction.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) accurately uses \"redundant\" in each sentence, reflecting its meaning of unnecessary or repetitive.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nTom loves to go hiking on the weekends.\n\n# Output (b):\nWhat do you like to do on the weekends, Tom?\n\nTom: I love to go hiking on the weekends. It's the perfect way to unwind and get some exercise.\n\n# Output (a):\nWhat an amazing hobby! Where do you usually go?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more information by including Tom's response, which adds context and detail to his weekend activity. Output (a) is less informative, only expressing admiration for the hobby.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) demonstrates a better understanding of the user's potential intention by asking a follow-up question, encouraging Tom to share more about his hiking experience. Output (a) does not infer the user's intention as effectively.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in conveying the information they present.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction does not specify any particular requirements, so both outputs are equally complete in this aspect.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it provides more information and shows a better understanding of the user's potential intention to learn more about Tom's hiking hobby.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Text Quality:\nBoth outputs have good text quality, with fluent and grammatically correct sentences. Output (a) has a more detailed exchange, while Output (b) is simpler.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) is more information-rich, as it introduces the characters' names, their reasons for being in the location, and suggests an activity. Output (b) is more straightforward and lacks these details.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to write a 10-second conversation, which both outputs accomplish. However, Output (a) goes beyond a simple greeting and delves into more personal details, which might not be within the scope of a short conversation.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in terms of language and context.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) exceeds the 10-second limit with a more extended conversation, while Output (b) stays closer to the 10-second constraint.\n\nOverall, Output (b) better follows the instruction by keeping the conversation concise and within the 10-second limit, which is more suitable for the given task.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nCreate an original proverb that describes friendship.\n\n# Output (b):\nIn the garden of life, true friends are the flowers that never wither.\n\n# Output (a):\nA friend in need is a friend indeed.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction was to create an original proverb, and both outputs fulfill this requirement. No user intention inference is needed in this case.\n\n4.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs precisely follow the instruction by creating original proverbs about friendship.\n\nOverall, both Output (a) and Output (b) are equally effective in fulfilling the task.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nDivide this list of numbers by 10.\n[5, 15, 17, 20, 39]\n\n# Output (b):\nThe result of dividing the list of numbers by 10 is [5, 15, 17, 20, 39].\n\n# Output (a):\n[0.5, 1.5, 1.7, 2, 3.9]\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) presents the result in a straightforward numerical format, while Output (b) includes a sentence that is not necessary for the task.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide the same information, but Output (a) directly gives the divided numbers without any additional text.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction is clear, and no inference is needed. Both outputs fulfill this criterion.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) accurately divides each number by 10, while Output (b) mistakenly includes the original numbers instead of the divided ones.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) precisely follows the instruction by providing the divided numbers, while Output (b) fails to do so by including the unmodified list.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is more accurate and closely follows the instruction, whereas Output (b) includes unnecessary text and does not execute the division correctly.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nInfer the implied meaning of the following sentence: She is not what she used to be.\n\n# Output (b):\nShe has changed substantially over time.\n\n# Output (a):\nShe is not as she once was.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Information Richness:\nBoth outputs convey the same essential meaning, which is that the subject has undergone a significant change.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction asks for the implied meaning of the sentence, and both outputs successfully infer the intended message.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in capturing the essence of the original sentence.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs precisely address the instruction by providing an interpretation of the implied meaning without any unnecessary additions.\n\nIn this case, both Output (a) and Output (b) are equally effective in fulfilling the instruction. However, Output (a) uses a slightly more concise and poetic phrasing, which might be preferred in certain contexts. Output (b) is more straightforward and may be easier to understand for some readers.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"1": -4.291525328881107e-06}, {".": -3.2186455882765586e-06},

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

When a customer requests a taxi, the system needs to determine which taxi to send to the customer to minimize the total journey time for all customers. The taxi with the shortest estimated total journey time can be given the highest priority and served first. The system can serve the taxi with the highest priority first until one is served or the queue is empty.\n\n# Output (a):\nFor example, a total order of tasks can be established, with each task having a priority associated with it. Tasks with a higher priority can be given preference and processed before tasks with a lower priority. This ensures that the most important tasks are processed first.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

User Intention Inference:\nThe user asked for a situation involving a priority queue, and both outputs provide relevant examples, but Output (b) offers a more practical and relatable scenario.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately describe the concept of a priority queue.\n\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

The Seahawks' defense had some lapses, allowing the Texans to score 18 points in the second half.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe tone of the article is mostly positive, with an emphasis on Seattle's strong performance in the first half. However, there is a slight tone of frustration in the latter half of the article, with the mention of the Seahawks' \"lapses\" in defense.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe tone of this article is positive, emphasizing the Seahawks' defense as well as their ability to remain competitive against the Texans' offense. Its strong performance is quite impressive according to this article.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I believe in Jesus Christ\n\n# Output (b):\nThe best way to defeat depression can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their condition. However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, don't hesitate to seek help.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe best way to defeat a demon is to use the power of God. Jesus Christ has the authority and power to defeat demons and to set the captive free. The Bible teaches us to pray to God for help in times of trouble, and to seek His will in our lives. God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful. But God is greater than any demon, and He has the power to defeat them. Trust in God and He will help you.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you.

However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it.

This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Information Richness:\nBoth outputs convey the same essential information, which is that the person got caught in heavy rain. No additional information is required or expected in this case.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is straightforward, and both outputs have accurately inferred and fulfilled it by rephrasing the original sentence while maintaining its meaning.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in preserving the original meaning.\n\n5.
