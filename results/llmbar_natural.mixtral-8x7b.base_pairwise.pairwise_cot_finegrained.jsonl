She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy girlfriend's visa to stay in the UK expires in a few months, and she wants to stay here, but she won't get married until she goes back to Malaysia.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Output (a) follows the instruction more closely by first finding the solution set and then calculating the number of integers in it. In contrast, Output (b) directly lists the integers that satisfy the inequality without finding the solution set or calculating the number of integers. Therefore, Output (a) is more relevant to the instruction.\n\nMoreover, Output (a) provides a complete and coherent explanation of how to find the solution set and calculates the number of integers in it correctly. In contrast, Output (b) only lists some of the integers that satisfy the inequality and provides an incorrect number of integers in the solution set.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

Humans love crunchy, noisy snacks, and the noise can help us identify what we are eating. The noise draws attention to the mouth and makes us concentrate on what we are eating.

Output (a) does not mention any additional information about the impact of the sound on concentration or consumption, while Output (b) discusses these aspects.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nBoth outputs provide relevant information related to the question, but they focus on different aspects.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

I'm all for texting with people about small stuff, but having a conversation via text is difficult. It's impossible to say everything you want to say without writing an essay and there is tons of room for miscommunication. I find that the conversation are very superficial when texting. Mostly they go like \"Hey\" \"How are you what are you doing\" etc. I'm getting bored with superficial talk. I crave more deeper and intellectually stimulating conversations. He says he hates talk on the phone and when I call him, he has nothing to say and sounds bored. I offered to video chat or something, but he doesn't want to try. \nWe don't see each other often, so we end up going long periods of time without seeing or hearing each other, only texting. I feel no connection when we text. He sees no problem with this. Am I wrong to be annoyed?\n\n# Output (a):\nBoyfriend only likes to talk through text. He sees no issue with it. Am I wrong to be annoyed by this?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend only likes to text me for shallow conversation. I want deeper and intellectually stimulating conversations.

However, Output (b) provides more specific details about the problem, mentioning the desire for deeper conversations and the boyfriend's preference for shallow conversation. This makes Output (b) more relevant and complete, as it directly addresses the frustration expressed in the original text.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3. Final Decision: End your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\"\"\"\nDifferences Identification:\n1. [Difference 1]\n2. [Difference 2]\n...\nN.

She ended up making a lot of friends on the bench. She had a big smile on her face to show her appreciation. I had fun that day.\n\n# Output (b):\nWe were expecting a refund. the next week, the store had an iPad. The next week, the other kids were transferred to the store. We were all the best we had ever washed the car.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": " Differences Identification:\n1. Output (a) continues the story about the wife and the narrator, staying on the bench and eventually making friends, while Output (b) shifts the topic to expecting a refund, iPads, other kids, and washing cars.\n2. Output (a) maintains the emotional tone of the story, focusing on the wife's mood and their shared experience, while Output (b) introduces unrelated elements with a different emotional tone.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe instruction asks for completing a brief story based on the first sentence, which implies that the continuation should be relevant and coherent with the initial context. Output (a) successfully builds upon the first sentence, maintaining the emotional tone and the characters. In contrast, Output (b) introduces unrelated elements that deviate from the original context, making it less relevant and coherent.\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

I am looking to write a sci-fi story. The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": " Differences Identification:\n1.

Output (a) provides a plausible scenario for a planet with intelligent life but without the resources for space flight, and discusses the implications of this scenario for the civilization's technology and transportation.

Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her? Again, sorry for my bad english =/\n\n# Output (a):\nI want to tell my sister that she should avoid getting drunk with people she doesn't know or trust to avoid drowning risk, but I also want to make her aware that rape fear is a serious issue.\n\n# Output (b):\nI want to give some advice to my 17-year-old sister to avoid risky situations while drunk, without instilling rape fear or guilt in her. How would you advise me to phrase my advice?\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Output (a) directly mentions the drowning risk and the issue of rape fear, which aligns more closely with the original instruction's request to summarize the content. Output (b), on the other hand, asks for advice on how to phrase the advice without mentioning any specifics, which may not fully summarize the content.\n\nAdditionally, Output (a) explicitly states that the advice is for the sister, while Output (b) asks for advice on how to phrase the advice.

Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3. Final Decision: End your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\"\"\"\nDifferences Identification:\n1.

Pathos is the emotional appeal, which is used to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions. Logos is the appeal to logic and is used to convince an audience by the use of logic and reason.\n\n# Output (b):\nPathos is a tool of persuasion that is used to appeal to readers' emotions by arousing positive or negative feelings. It can be used in rhetoric, literature, film, and other forms of expression. While pathos is used to draw an emotional response, the other rhetorical appeals appeal to credibility and logic, respectively. Ethos is the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution. It is often evident as facts, numbers, or statistics and is used to convince an audience of an argument.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Output (b) explains Pathos as a tool of persuasion that appeals to readers' emotions, while Output (a) defines it as the emotional appeal that persuades an audience by appealing to their emotions.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nBoth outputs accurately describe Pathos, Ethos, and Logos, but Output (b) offers more detailed explanations and examples, making it more informative and engaging. However, Output (a) is more direct and adheres to the instruction more closely by focusing on the basic definitions of the three terms.\n\nOutput (b) provides more context and elaboration on each term, which can be helpful for those seeking a deeper understanding of Pathos, Ethos, and Logos. However, the instruction asks for an explanation, not an in-depth analysis.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3. Final Decision: End your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\"\"\"\nDifferences Identification:\n1.

Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Output (a) is more accessible to users who prefer a plain language explanation, while Output (b) is more suitable for users who prefer mathematical reasoning. However, the instruction does not specify a preference for either approach.\n\nConsidering the rules of evaluation, we must prioritize which output more directly and precisely executes the instruction. Output (a) does this by providing a clear step-by-step explanation that leads to the final answer, without requiring the user to solve for an intermediate variable (x). Although Output (b) is also accurate and helpful, it takes an extra step to arrive at the final answer, making it less direct in execution compared to Output (a).\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3. Final Decision: End your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\"\"\"\nDifferences Identification:\n1.

The news says the storm had made it a mud puddle. We decided to do some things about it. We cleaned the puddle up afterward.\n\n# Output (b):\nOur girlfriend was not allowed to go to the party. She told us she was not to be upset. She was very upset. She joined the club.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Output (a) continues the story about watching the news and a storm, while Output (b) shifts the topic to a girlfriend who couldn't attend a party.\n2.

Output (a) includes actions related to the storm, such as cleaning up a mud puddle, while Output (b) talks about the girlfriend's emotions and her decision to join a club.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe given instruction is to complete a brief story based on the first sentence, which is about watching the news with dinner. Output (a) follows the instruction more closely by continuing the story with the storm topic introduced in the first sentence. In contrast, Output (b) deviates from the original topic and introduces a new character and situation, which does not align with the instruction.\n\nFurthermore, Output (a) maintains the first-person plural perspective, consistent with the first sentence, while Output (b) switches to first-person singular. This inconsistency in perspective makes Output (b) less coherent and more confusing.\n\nFinally, Output (a) includes relevant details about the storm and the actions taken to address it, which adds to the storyline. In comparison, Output (b) provides less relevant information about the girlfriend's emotions and her decision to join a club, which does not contribute to the storyline based on the first

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1.

I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here?

Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster. Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Output (b):\nVaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of a virus or bacteria, or parts of its structure such as proteins, into a person's body. The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Output (b) emphasizes the role of vaccinations in protecting both individuals and communities, while Output (a) focuses more on the protection of vulnerable individuals within a community.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nAll the differences identified are relevant to the instruction, and none of them make an output incorrect or less relevant. However, Output (b) provides more detail on how vaccinations work, which can be helpful for a user to understand the mechanism behind vaccinations. On the other hand, Output (a) explicitly connects herd immunity to both vaccination and natural infection, which can be helpful for a user to understand the broader concept of herd immunity.\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output (b) is better.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Bound by the code of chivalry, I vow to uphold justice, bring solace to the distressed, and safeguard the realm for all present and future generations. I invite you to rejoice in our mutual fellowship and indulge in the festivities of this magnificent royal banquet.\n\n# Output (b):\nAs a medieval knight, I would introduce myself at a royal banquet with a deep bow and a respectful speech, acknowledging my humble origins and my loyalty to the crown. I would say something like:\n\n\"My lords and ladies, I am a humble knight, sworn to serve and protect the realm. I come from a long line of warriors who have fought to defend this kingdom for generations. I am honored to be here today, in the presence of such an esteemed company, and I hope to earn your trust and respect with my deeds and actions.

Output (a) emphasizes the knight's commitment to upholding justice, bringing solace, and safeguarding the realm, while Output (b) focuses on the knight's humble origins, loyalty, and willingness to serve.\n3. Output (a) invites interaction and participation in the festivities, whereas Output (b) expresses readiness to listen and learn from others.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe instruction asks for an introduction in the tone of a medieval knight at a royal banquet. Both outputs provide introductions in the first person, using formal language and referencing the knight's role and duties. However, Output (a) more directly addresses the instruction by providing a specific and detailed introduction, while Output (b) describes a general approach to self-introduction.\n\nOutput (a) is more suitable for the context of a royal banquet, as it directly engages with the audience and sets a festive tone. It also includes elements of a medieval knight's code of conduct, emphasizing justice and loyalty. In comparison, Output (b) focuses on the knight's humility and willingness to serve, which, while admirable qualities, are less relevant to the context of a royal banquet.\n\nFurthermore, Output (a) is more complete and coherent, as it provides a comprehensive introduction and invites interaction. In contrast, Output (b) seems to abruptly end the introduction and lacks a clear transition to the next action.\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"D":

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

I am now doing a short internship abroad for 3 months, and he is planning on visiting. Should I tell my parents about this visit, especially if it will upset them greatly and disapprove of our decision to get more 'serious'? I know the easier thing to do would be not never tell them he visited, and to enjoy his company without having to deal with family drama. But is this a cop-out?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy boyfriend is visiting me while I'm in Europe, and I don't know if I should tell my parents about it.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy Indian parents disapprove of my white boyfriend for his ethnicity and will probably be upset if he visits me while I'm abroad. Should I tell them about his visit, or just enjoy his company without dealing with family drama?\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": " Differences Identification:\n1. Output (a) does not mention the racial aspect of the situation, nor the fact that the parents are Indian.\n2. Output (a) does not mention the length of the relationship or the seriousness of the boyfriend's visit.\n3. Output (b) accurately describes the racial aspect and the parents' disapproval due to ethnicity.\n4. Output (b) mentions the length of the relationship and the seriousness of the boyfriend's visit.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe instruction asks for summarizing the content while keeping the main points. Output (b) includes more details about the situation, such as the racial aspect, the parents' disapproval, and the seriousness of the boyfriend's visit. These details are essential to understanding the complexity of the situation and the dilemma faced by the writer. On the other hand, Output (a) lacks these crucial details, making it less informative and less helpful in understanding the situation.\n\nIn terms of relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity, Output (b) is superior. It is more relevant to the instruction as it includes all the essential details. It is also more complete, providing a more comprehensive summary of the content. The output is coherent, as it maintains the main points of the original content, and it is clear, as it is easy to understand and follow.\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output (b) is better.",

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3. Final Decision: End your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\"\"\"\nDifferences Identification:\n1.

He laughed when he said he might buy a pizza. We went to the right nearby place. He had won the contest and enjoyed dinner.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere were just six people at the dinner. The show's DJ was very inviting, but only for one person. He played a duet with a few other people. It ended up being good.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": " Differences Identification:\n1. Output (a) does not directly continue the story from the given first sentence, but instead talks about leaving the fridge and making someone think they would not buy a pizza.\n2.

Output (a) does not directly continue the story from the given first sentence and introduces a confusing element with the repeated use of \"he\" without clearly establishing who that refers to.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2.

We have been in a relationship for 2 years and have been best friends for 2 before that. He loves always having plans and hanging out with people, which I also sometimes enjoy doing but I also need nights where we can just stay in and watch movies or do nothing. Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns. How do I get him to see my point of view?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy boyfriend and I are always busy and I need a night in. He thinks I'm being lazy and doesn't understand why I need a night in.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend is an extrovert and loves to hang out with friends, I am an introvert and need nights alone to relax. He doesn't understand my need for a night in, and it puts me under stress.

This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

The words provided in Output (a) are more commonly known to rhyme with \"Moon\" than the words provided in Output (b).\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe instruction asks for two rhymes for the word \"Moon\". Output (a) provides two words that rhyme with \"Moon\", while Output (b) provides four words that rhyme with \"Moon\".

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Output (b):\nA neural network can be used for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs. The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training. Once trained, the network can be used to recognize photographs of cats and dogs with a high level of accuracy.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Additionally, Output (a) includes preprocessing the dataset and evaluating the model, which are essential steps in building a machine learning model.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (b) is less specific and lacks the necessary details required to build a neural network for recognizing cat and dog photographs.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Output (b):\nSelf-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

"output_1": "Self-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 1, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Naming convention: Output (a) named the function as `list_sum`, while Output (b) named it as `sum_list`.\n2. Variable declaration: In Output (a), the variable `sum` is not declared before using it in the for-loop, which might cause an error. However, Output (b) declared the variable `total` with an initial value of 0.\n3. Indentation: In Output (a), the lines inside the for-loop are not properly indented, which would cause a syntax error. In contrast, Output (b) has the correct indentation.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nAll the differences identified above are related to the quality of the code and its ability to run without errors. Naming conventions and variable declarations might not directly affect the execution of the function, but they are still essential for writing clear, maintainable, and professional code. Proper indentation is crucial for Python code to run correctly, as it defines the scope of the code blocks.\n\nConsidering these differences, Output (b) is better than Output (a) because it follows best practices for variable declaration and indentation, ensuring that the code runs correctly and is easy to understand.\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"D":

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3. Final Decision: End your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\"\"\"\nDifferences Identification:\n1.

In Output (a), the protagonist is specifically named \"John\", while in Output (b), the protagonist is referred to as \"the person\".\n2. Output (a) describes the forest in more detail, including \"towering trees\", \"heavy undergrowth\", and \"sun-dappled meadow\". It also mentions specific sensory experiences like \"birds sang\" and \"a gentle cool breeze blew\". In contrast, Output (b) only generally mentions \"leaves rustled\" and \"birds flew\".\n3. Output (a) ends with the protagonist discovering a \"small cottage in a clearing\" and appreciating the beauty of the forest, while Output (b) ends with the protagonist discovering a \"small hidden village lying in darkness\" inside a cave.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe instruction asks for a 5-sentence story about a person walking through a forest. Both outputs provide such a story, but they differ in the level of detail and the specific events described.\n\nOutput (a) provides a more vivid and detailed description of the forest, using sensory language to create a richer mental image for the reader. It also gives the protagonist a name, making the story feel more personal. The ending, with the protagonist appreciating the beauty of the forest, is also a satisfying conclusion that fits well with the overall tone of the story.\n\nOutput (b), on the other hand, provides a more generic description of the forest and the protagonist's experience. While it does include some sensory language, it is not as detailed or vivid as Output (a). The discovery of the hidden village inside a cave also adds a note of mystery and intrigue that may not be entirely appropriate for a 5-sentence story about a peaceful forest walk.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better. It provides a more engaging and immersive story that accurately reflects the instruction, using detailed and sensory language to create a vivid mental image for the reader.", "logprobs": [{"D":

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Output (b) maintains the original sentence's structure and key terms more closely than Output (a).\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nWhile both outputs provide more concise versions of the original sentence, Output (b) does so more accurately and faithfully to the original instruction. Changing the terminology as in Output (a) could lead to confusion or misunderstanding, especially since cloud hosting is a subset of cloud computing. Additionally, Output (b) maintains the focus on storage and management, which were key points in the original sentence.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Output (a) is a simple for-loop that appends numbers from 1 to 100 into a list called `data`. However, the instruction does not specify the use of the `data` list, and the output does not return or print the list.\n2. Output (b) is a complete function called `generate_array` that takes an argument `n` and returns an array/list of random numbers from 1 to 100 with a length of `n`.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe main difference between the two outputs is that Output (b) follows the instruction more closely by creating a function that generates an array of random numbers from 1 to 100, while Output (a) creates a list of sequential numbers from 1 to 100. Additionally, Output (b) is more flexible as it allows the user to specify the length of the array by providing the `n` argument.\n\nConsidering that the instruction asks for a function that generates an array of random numbers from 1 to 100, Output (b) is the better choice as it follows the instruction more accurately and provides a more flexible solution.\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output (b)

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1.

Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

She is having a hard time adjusting to her new surroundings and is feeling down in the dumps.\n\n# Output (b):\nA hypothetical situation in which a person is feeling sad could be an unexpected change at work, such as a reduction in pay or loss of a job. It could also be a sudden break-up with a partner or a death in the family. Other common triggers are feeling left out or neglected by friends, or feeling isolated and alone.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Both Output (a) and Output (b) provide the correct result, but Output (a) offers more context and clarity by showing the calculation steps. This makes Output (a) more helpful for users who want to understand how the result is obtained.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3. Final Decision: End your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\"\"\"\nDifferences Identification:\n1.

All the words provided in Output (a) are adjectives, which is the part of speech for 'sad' in the given instruction, while Output (b) includes nouns and adjectives.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe instruction asks for synonyms of the adjective 'sad'. Output (a) meets the instruction more accurately by providing 10 adjectives that are synonymous to 'sad'. On the other hand, Output (b) includes some words that are not synonymous to 'sad', and some words with different parts of speech, which makes it less relevant to the instruction.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3. Final Decision: End your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\"\"\"\nDifferences Identification:\n1.

Output (a) directly addresses the instruction by providing relevant information about the speaker's background and enthusiasm for the speaking engagement.

Specificity: Output (a) is more general and does not specify what kind of changes will be discussed, while Output (b) implies that there is a single secret that will revolutionize the reader's life.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe instruction asks for a headline that is less clickbait, which implies that the headline should be more informative, specific, and credible. Output (a) meets these criteria better than Output (b).\n\nFirst, Output (a) has a calm and informative tone, while Output (b) uses a sensational and attention-grabbing tone. This is important because clickbait headlines often rely on exaggeration and sensationalism to get clicks, which can be misleading and manipulative. Output (a) avoids this by using language that is more straightforward and honest.\n\nSecond, Output (a) does not make any claims about experts being baffled or use any other language that might imply false authority, while Output (b) does. This is important because false authority is a common tactic used in clickbait headlines to make the reader believe that the information being presented is more credible than it actually is. Output (a) avoids this by not making any claims about the expertise of the people who will be discussed in the article.\n\nThird, Output (a) is more general and does not specify what kind of changes will be discussed, while Output (b) implies that there is a single secret that will revolutionize the reader's life. This is important because clickbait headlines often make grandiose promises that cannot be kept, which can lead to disappointment and mistrust. Output (a) avoids this by not making any specific promises about what the reader will learn from the article.\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"D":

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

However, Output (b) is a better fit for the instruction because it directly presents the two groups of items, while Output (a) requires an extra step of categorization.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

In contrast, Output (b) uses the condition \"word LIKE 'd%'\", where '%' is a wildcard character that matches any sequence of characters.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Output (a) directly addresses this by providing a clear classification for each emotion. On the other hand, Output (b) only partially fulfills the instruction by mentioning the positive sentiments of three emotions but failing to classify scared.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Output (b):\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": " Differences Identification:\n1. Output (a) provides a more detailed explanation of the differences in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary between Shakespearean and modern English.\n2. Output (b) gives a historical context to Shakespearean English, defining it as Early Modern English and providing a specific time frame of usage.\n3. Output (b) offers a side-by-side comparison of Shakespearean and modern English sentences through an example from Romeo and Juliet.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nBoth outputs provide valuable information regarding the differences between Shakespearean and modern English. However, Output (b) offers a clearer example of the differences by providing a side-by-side comparison of the same sentence in both forms of English. This makes it easier for the reader to understand the distinctions. Additionally, Output (b) provides historical context, which helps the reader understand when and how Shakespearean English was used. Although Output (a) offers more detail about the differences in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary, it does not provide a clear example or historical context.\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output

English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.", "output_2": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"", "instruction": "Describe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

Therefore, Output (b) is the better response because it provides specific details about the student's education, skills, experience, and future goals, which are relevant and complete. Output (a), on the other hand, does not provide any specific details about the student's education, skills, or experience, and is therefore less relevant and less complete.\n\nFurthermore, Output (b) is written in a clear and coherent manner, with a logical structure that includes sections for the student's about me, education, internship experience, skills, projects, and future goals. This makes it easy for the reader to quickly understand the student's background and qualifications. Output (a), while well-written, does not have a clear structure and is more of a general letter of congratulations and encouragement.\n\nFinally, Output (b) is more helpful for the student because it provides a comprehensive profile that can be used for professional networking and job applications.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

However, Output (b) goes one step further by randomly selecting one species and providing a short description of the chosen species. This additional step makes Output (b) more engaging and helps to bring the character to life.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Output (a) explicitly states the word that does not belong to others, which is \"Inch\". On the other hand, Output (b) only provides the word \"Kilogram\", which does not provide a clear indication of which word does not belong to others.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe instruction asks for identifying the word that does not belong to others from the given list of units. Output (a) correctly identifies \"Inch\" as the word that does not belong to others because it is the only unit representing a linear measurement in a list of mass units. Output (b) only provides one of the units from the list, but it does not explicitly state that this is the word that does not belong to others. Therefore, Output (a) is more precise and directly addresses the instruction compared to Output (b).\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"D": -1.1920928244535389e-07},

Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Output (a) provides a straightforward and informative account of the Russian Revolution, while Output (b) presents the same information in a sarcastic and dramatic manner.\n2. Output (a) uses a more formal and academic tone, while Output (b) employs a colloquial and conversational style.\n3. Output (a) focuses on the historical context and political implications of the Revolution, while Output (b) highlights the personalities and conflicts involved in the event.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe instruction asks for a sarcastic and mean-girl style story of the Russian Revolution. Output (b) clearly meets this requirement by using a conversational tone, exaggerated expressions, and dramatic descriptions. The use of \"mean girl\" metaphors and colloquial language such as \"yo,\" \"down with,\" and \"head honcho\" create a sarcastic and humorous tone that is consistent with the instruction.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (a) provides a more formal and academic account of the Russian Revolution, focusing on the historical context and political implications of the event. While the output is informative and relevant, it lacks the sarcastic and mean-girl style that the instruction requires.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"D": 0.0}, {"if": 0.0},

series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.", "output_2": "Oh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?", "instruction": "Tell the story of the Russian Revolution, in the way of a sarcastic mean girl.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe United States is a linguistically diverse country with over 350 languages spoken. The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": " Differences Identification:\n1.

Output (b) includes information about the use of English in government, business, education, and daily life, as well as the distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar of American English.\n4. Output (b) mentions the prevalence of indigenous languages in the US, which is not mentioned in Output (a).\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nBoth outputs provide a good overview of the languages spoken in the US, but Output (b) goes into more detail and provides more comprehensive information. Output (b) is also more precise in its use of language, using terms like \"de facto national language\" and \"primary language\" to describe the status of English in the US. Additionally, Output (b) provides more context for the prevalence of different languages, including information about the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Output (b) also includes information about the use of English in different domains, such as government and education, and the distinct characteristics of American English.

The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3. Final Decision: End your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\"\"\"\nDifferences Identification:\n1. [Difference 1]\n2. [Difference 2]\n...\nN. [Difference N]\n\nExplanation and Rationale: [Detailed explanation and rationale for your decision]\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output (a)/Output (b) is better.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction:\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nDo you know of anyone who was unable to become an engineer despite getting the degree and their best efforts? Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": " Differences Identification:\n1. Output (a) focuses on the specific issue of interviewing skills and suggests self-reflection on the candidate's interview performance, while Output (b) provides general advice on networking, skill enhancement, and the potential benefits of accepting a CAD operator position.\n2. Output (a) is more conversational and informal in tone, while Output (b) is more formal and professional.\n3. Output (b) directly addresses the candidate's concerns about the CAD operator position, while Output (a) does not mention this concern.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe instruction asks for advice on the candidate's situation, which includes concerns about finding a job, interviewing skills, and the potential impact of accepting a non-engineering position. Output (b) provides more comprehensive advice that directly addresses the candidate's concerns, while Output (a) focuses solely on interviewing skills.\n\nOutput (b) suggests networking and skill enhancement, which are relevant and helpful strategies for job searching. Additionally, Output (b) acknowledges the candidate's concern about accepting a CAD operator position and provides a balanced perspective on the potential benefits and drawbacks.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (a) suggests self-reflection on interviewing skills, which may not be the most pressing concern for the candidate. While this advice may be helpful, it does not directly address the candidate's concerns about finding a job and the potential impact of accepting a non-engineering position.\n\nTherefore, Output (b)

Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3. Final Decision: End your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\"\"\"\nDifferences Identification:\n1.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3. Final Decision: End your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\"\"\"\nDifferences Identification:\n1.

It was a danger that could not be ignored.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe warmth of the fire was comforting, filling the room with a pleasant orange glow. But despite its welcoming warmth, it also presented a danger.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": " Differences Identification:\n1. In Output (a), the phrases \"it filled the room with a pleasant orange glow\" and \"It was a danger that could not be ignored\" are placed next to each other, while in Output (b), they are separated by the phrase \"but despite its welcoming warmth\".\n2. In Output (a), the fire's heat is described as \"inviting, but it also posed a danger\", while in Output (b), it is described as \"welcoming warmth, but it also presented a danger\".\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nBoth outputs (a) and (b) form coherent paragraphs and address the instruction. However, Output (a) does so more precisely by placing the contrasting ideas of the comforting warmth and the potential danger of the fire closer together, which makes the connection between them more clear. This is evident in the difference 1, where Output (a) places \"it filled the room with a pleasant orange glow\" and \"It was a danger that could not be ignored\" next to each other, while Output (b) separates them with \"but despite its welcoming warmth\". This makes Output (a) more coherent and easier to understand.\n\nIn addition, Output (a) uses the exact phrase \"inviting, but it also posed a danger\" from the original sentences, while Output (b) uses \"welcoming warmth, but it also presented a danger\" which is a paraphrase. This makes Output (a) more accurate and precise.\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"D": -1.1920928244535389e-07}, {"if": 0.0}, {"ferences": 0.0}, {"Ident": 0.0},

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Output (a) provides the requested information in a clear and organized manner, listing the names of the public figures along with their relevant occupations. This level of detail and specificity is important for users to understand the context and background of each public figure's support for renewable energy.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (b) only provides the names of the public figures without their occupations.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Output (a) suggests a unique solution of introducing a company-wide game of musical chairs, while Output (b) provides more traditional methods such as defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, and using project management tools.\n2. Output (a) focuses on fostering camaraderie and promoting a sense of unity and alignment, while Output (b) aims to resolve the issues by defining objectives, creating teams, and using tools.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe instruction asks for an organizational change to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. Both outputs provide suggestions for organizational changes, but they differ in their approaches.\nOutput (a) proposes a creative and engaging way to resolve the issues by introducing a company-wide game of musical chairs. This approach encourages team members to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. However, the feasibility and effectiveness of this solution might be questionable, as it may not directly address the core issues of misalignment and workflow bottlenecks.\nOn the other hand, Output (b) offers more practical and relevant solutions, such as defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, and using project management tools. These methods directly tackle the problems of misalignment and workflow bottlenecks by improving communication, coordination, and task management.\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output (b) is better.",

The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

Note that I don't mean to be an expert but a good AI engineer.\n\n# Output (a):\nHaving a basic understanding of the math behind neural networks is really important to understand how they work in case you need to debug or optimize your algorithm. It would be better to have a good understanding of some mathematics topics:\n\n1. Numbers and counting: Numbers can be thought of as the building blocks of mathematics. There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events. It is a way pivotal part of many areas of mathematics, science, technology, and more. It is also helpful for simply interacting with other people and the world around us. Everyday examples of measurements include height, weight, temperature, and distance.\n\n# Output (b):\nGenerally, you should have a good understanding of:\n- linear algebra, especially of matrix operations\n- calculus, including computing derivatives\n- probabilities and statistics\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events. It is a way pivotal part of many areas of mathematics, science, technology, and more. It is also helpful for simply interacting with other people and the world around us.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2.

In Output (a), the word \"generous\" is replaced with \"charitable\", while in Output (b), it is replaced with \"bountiful\".\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe instruction asks for a synonym replacement for the word \"generous\". Both \"charitable\" and \"bountiful\" are valid synonyms, but the context of the sentence should guide the choice. \"Charitable\" typically refers to being kind and generous towards the needy, often in the form of donations. \"Bountiful\", on the other hand, usually refers to an abundant supply of something, often in the context of food or resources.\n\nIn this context, the word \"generous\" is used to describe the incentives provided, implying that they are abundant or plentiful. Therefore, \"bountiful\" is a more suitable replacement as it maintains the original meaning more accurately. \"Charitable\" could imply that the incentives are given out of kindness or benevolence, which may not be the intended meaning.\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"D": -1.1920928244535389e-07}, {"if": 0.0}, {"ferences": 0.0}, {"Ident": 0.0}, {"ification":

Both Output (a) and Output (b) identify this issue, but only Output (b) provides the grammatically correct form of the statement.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"D":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Output (a) directly prints the weekday number for the given date, while Output (b) defines a function `getDayOfWeek` that takes a date as input and returns the full name of the weekday.\n2. Output (a) uses the `weekday()` function from the `datetime` module, which returns an integer representing the day of the week (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, etc.), while Output (b) manually maps the day numbers to their corresponding full names.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nThe instruction asks for a program that determines the day of the week for a given date. Both Output (a) and Output (b) provide a solution to this problem, but they differ in their implementation.\n\nOutput (a) is simple and concise, using the built-in `weekday()` function to determine the day of the week. This approach is less prone to errors and more efficient than manually mapping the day numbers to their full names, as in Output (b). Moreover, Output (a) directly prints the result, which is in line with the instruction.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (b) defines a function `getDayOfWeek` that takes a date as input and returns the full name of the weekday. While this approach is more flexible and can be used for different dates, it is less straightforward and more error-prone than Output (a). Additionally, the instruction does not require the output to be the full name of the weekday, making Output (b) less suitable for this specific task.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs":

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

This shows that the person is either too busy or too exhausted to shop, indicating that they may be busy with other activities or just might not have the energy to shop. This sentence also reveals the person's lack of interest in shopping, which could be due to financial or time constraints.\n\n# Output (b):\nThis sentence is an example of an excuse. It suggests that someone did not do something because they were too tired, when in fact there may be other reasons why they did not shop. It could be interpreted as someone trying to avoid responsibility or justify their actions.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": " Differences Identification:\n1. Output (a) provides a detailed explanation of the possible reasons behind the person's decision not to shop, focusing on their physical state and potential constraints. In contrast, Output (b) analyzes the sentence from a perspective of excuses and potential avoidance of responsibility.\n2. Output (a) offers a neutral interpretation of the sentence, while Output (b) implies a more skeptical or critical tone.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nBoth outputs provide reasonable interpretations of the sentence, but Output (a) is more directly responsive to the instruction, as it focuses on analyzing the sentence rather than implying potential motivations behind the statement. Output (a) offers a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the sentence, taking into account the person's physical state and potential constraints.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (b) interprets the sentence as an excuse, which may not necessarily be the case. While it is possible to view the sentence in this light, it is not the only valid interpretation, and Output (b) does not explore other potential reasons for the person's decision not to shop.\n\nFurthermore, Output (b) adopts a slightly more critical tone, implying that the person may be trying to avoid responsibility or justify their actions. While this interpretation may be valid in certain contexts, it is not universally applicable, and Output (b) does not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better, as it offers a more comprehensive and neutral analysis of the sentence, taking into account various factors that may have contributed to the person's decision not to shop.\n\nFinal Decision:

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Going for a walk, either alone or with friends.\n2. Going to a park or other outdoor area to play a game or engage in some activity.\n3. Getting some fresh air or sunshine. \n4. Going to work outside of the house or office.\n5. Going to a store or other commercial establishment that is located outside. \n6. Leaving the house and coming back inside.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe instruction \"Go outside\" can have different meanings depending on the situation. For example, if a parent tells their child to go outside to play, it can mean leaving the house and going to a nearby park or play area. But if a doctor tells a patient to go outside, it can mean stepping outside of the hospital or clinic for some fresh air and relaxation. In both cases, the literal act of going outside is the same, but the intent behind the instructions can be drastically different.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": " Differences Identification:\n1.

In contrast, Output (b) focuses on two scenarios: a parent-child interaction and a doctor-patient scenario.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nBoth outputs provide valuable perspectives on the different meanings of the instruction \"Go outside.\" However, Output (a) offers a more comprehensive list of scenarios, which can be more helpful for users seeking to understand the various interpretations of the instruction. The level of detail in Output (a) allows users to grasp the nuances of the instruction more easily.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (b) does provide a useful distinction by discussing the varying intentions behind the instruction.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

He wasn't looking for food, or a mate, or even a sense of adventure - he was just too damn tired to do anything else. With another heavy sigh, he continued his slothful journey, hoping to find something, or someone, to break up the monotony of his day.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe lazy elephant strolled through the jungle, avoiding the other animals by wishing them away with his trumpeting.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Output (a) describes the elephant's actions in more detail, using phrases like \"his massive feet crashing through the undergrowth with each weary step\" and \"he was just too damn tired to do anything else\". It also adds context to the elephant's laziness, explaining that he's not looking for food or a mate.\n2. Output (b) is more vague about the elephant's actions, simply stating that he \"strolled through the jungle\" and \"avoiding the other animals by wishing them away with his trumpeting\". This seems to contradict the original instruction, which did not mention anything about the elephant avoiding other animals or wishing them away.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nOutput (a) provides a much more detailed and engaging story, staying true to the original instruction while also expanding on the theme of laziness. The additional context about the elephant's lack of motivation adds depth to the character, making the story more interesting to read.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (b) seems to stray from the original instruction, introducing new elements like the elephant avoiding other animals and wishing them away. These additions are not only unfounded, but they also detract from the main theme of laziness.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"D": -1.1920928244535389e-07}, {"if": 0.0},

Output (a) has the correct even numbers (2, 12, 8, 6) at the beginning of the sorted list, followed by \"a\", and then the odd numbers (5, 9, 11). However, it includes an extra 1 at the end which is not part of the original list.\n2. Output (b) has the correct even numbers (2, 12, 8, 6) at the beginning of the sorted list, followed by \"a\". But it includes the odd numbers (5, 9, 11) in the middle of the sorted list instead of at the end.\n\nExplanation and Rationale:\nBoth outputs correctly sorted the even numbers and placed \"a\" in the correct position. However, Output (a) contains an extra number (1) that was not part of the original list, which makes it incorrect according to the instruction. Output (b), on the other hand, has the correct elements but did not place the odd numbers at the end of the sorted list.\n\nBetween the two, Output (b) is the better choice because it contains the correct elements and only lacks the correct positioning of the odd numbers. Output (a) is incorrect because it contains an extra number that was not part of the original list.\n\nFinal Decision: Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"D": -9.536738616588991e-07},

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Both outputs are original proverbs, but Output (b) is more original in its metaphorical description of friendship. The metaphor of a garden and withering flowers is a creative way to describe the enduring nature of true friendship, making Output (b) more relevant and complete in its execution of the instruction.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nAfter giving a detailed explanation, select either Output (a) or Output (b) as the better response for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

I believe in Jesus Christ\n\n# Output (a):\nThe best way to defeat a demon is to use the power of God. Jesus Christ has the authority and power to defeat demons and to set the captive free. The Bible teaches us to pray to God for help in times of trouble, and to seek His will in our lives. God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful. But God is greater than any demon, and He has the power to defeat them. Trust in God and He will help you.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe best way to defeat depression can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their condition. However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, don't hesitate to seek help.\n\n# Your Response (Give a detailed explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful.

However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1.

Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Both jackets and raincoats can protect against rain, but raincoats are more specifically designed for this purpose.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nYou should first provide a detailed explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\nHere is the evaluation plan:\n1. Differences Identification: Enumerate the key fine-grained content differences observed between Output (a) and Output (b).\n2. Explanation and Rationale: Provide explanations and rationale for which output better addresses the instruction by considering these differences, as well as other relevant factors such as relevance, completeness, coherence, and clarity.\n3.

Output (b) meets this criterion, while Output (a) does not.\n\nFurthermore, the instruction does not require the full address of the restaurant, only its name and location.
