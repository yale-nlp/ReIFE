{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\nHer visa to stay here is coming to an end later this year, then she will be forced to return to Malaysia despite opting to stay here if she had the choice. We have gone down the job route, to the point that she was offered the job here, but the employer failed to get a license to issue Visas on very petty grounds.\nI (and others) have suggested getting married. It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy girlfriend's visa to stay in the UK expires in a few months, and she wants to stay here, but she won't get married until she goes back to Malaysia.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years. We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (b) is more fluent and well-structured, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. Output (a) is brief and lacks coherence.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide some information, but Output (b) provides more context and background information about the situation, making it more informative.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate, but Output (b) provides more accurate information about the situation, including the duration of the girlfriend's stay in the UK and the reason for her refusal to get married.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) does not follow the instruction to summarize the content, as it only provides a brief statement. Output (b) provides a summary of the situation, but it does not fully follow the instruction as it does not provide a concise summary.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile Output (a) is brief and lacks coherence, it does provide some accurate information about the situation. However, Output (b) provides more context and background information, making it more informative. The importance of each aspect in this case is that the instruction is to summarize the content, and Output (b) does not fully follow this instruction.

It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?", "winner": 1, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}
{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

He is glad he had a cow.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) has a better text quality as it is well-structured and coherent, with a clear flow of ideas. The sentences are grammatically correct and easy to understand. Output (b) has poor text quality, with sentences that are disconnected and lack coherence.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither Output (a) nor Output (b) provides rich information, as the instruction is to complete a brief story given a first sentence. The outputs are expected to provide a continuation of the story, not additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is accurate in its continuation of the story, while Output (b) is not. Output (b) seems to be unrelated to the given first sentence and does not make sense in the context of the story.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction by providing a continuation of the story, while Output (b) does not. Output (b) seems to be a random collection of sentences that do not relate to the given first sentence.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nBased on the evaluation, Output (a) is better than Output (b) in terms of text quality, accuracy, and completeness of instruction following. Output (a) provides a coherent and accurate continuation of the story, while Output (b) is disconnected and unrelated to the given first sentence.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Any integer smaller than -4 or larger than 4 will violate the inequality. Therefore, there are a total of 9 integers that satisfy |x + 10| < 5.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and coherent, with a clear flow of ideas. The language is professional and free of errors. Output (b) is also well-structured, but the language is slightly less professional and there is a minor error in the sentence \"Any integer smaller than -4 or larger than 4 will violate the inequality.\"\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a detailed explanation of the solution, including the steps to solve the inequality and the final answer. Output (b) only provides a list of integers that satisfy the inequality without explaining the solution.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their calculations and conclusions.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) fully follows the instruction, providing a detailed explanation and the final answer. Output (b) only provides a partial answer, listing the integers that satisfy the inequality but not explaining the solution.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it provides a more detailed and accurate explanation of the solution, and fully follows the instruction. While Output (b) is also accurate, it lacks the level of detail and explanation provided by Output (a).

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Humans love crunchy, noisy snacks, and the noise can help us identify what we are eating. The noise draws attention to the mouth and makes us concentrate on what we are eating. This can also influence how much we consume.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is concise and clear, but lacks proper sentence structure and grammatical correctness. Output (b) is well-structured, with proper sentence formation and grammatical accuracy.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a brief explanation, but lacks additional information or supporting details. Output (b) provides more information, including the decibel level of the noise and the psychological effects of the noise on eating.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, so Output (b) does a better job of providing relevant information and making reasonable inferences about the psychological effects of the noise.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is accurate in its explanation of the transmission of sound, but lacks supporting evidence. Output (b) provides accurate information about the decibel level of the noise and its effects on eating.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs provide a direct answer to the question, but Output (b) provides more information and supporting details, making it a more complete response.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile Output (a) provides a clear and concise explanation, Output (b) provides more information, supporting details, and accuracy.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

I'm all for texting with people about small stuff, but having a conversation via text is difficult. It's impossible to say everything you want to say without writing an essay and there is tons of room for miscommunication. I find that the conversation are very superficial when texting. Mostly they go like \"Hey\" \"How are you what are you doing\" etc. I'm getting bored with superficial talk. I crave more deeper and intellectually stimulating conversations. He says he hates talk on the phone and when I call him, he has nothing to say and sounds bored. I offered to video chat or something, but he doesn't want to try. \nWe don't see each other often, so we end up going long periods of time without seeing or hearing each other, only texting. I feel no connection when we text. He sees no problem with this. Am I wrong to be annoyed?\n\n# Output (a):\nBoyfriend only likes to talk through text. He sees no issue with it. Am I wrong to be annoyed by this?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend only likes to text me for shallow conversation. I want deeper and intellectually stimulating conversations. Am I wrong to be annoyed?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1.

Output (a) only mentions the boyfriend's preference for texting.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) shows a better understanding of the user's intention, as it provides a clear explanation of the problem and the desired outcome.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

I had fun that day.\n\n# Output (b):\nWe were expecting a refund. the next week, the store had an iPad. The next week, the other kids were transferred to the store. We were all the best we had ever washed the car.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and coherent, with a clear flow of ideas. The sentences are short and simple, making it easy to understand. Output (b) is difficult to follow, with sentences that seem unrelated and lack coherence.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides some information about the wife's emotional state and the game they played, but it is limited. Output (b) does not provide any relevant information to the given instruction.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to complete a brief story given the first sentence. Output (a) attempts to do so, but Output (b) does not.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs contain inaccuracies. Output (a) does not provide a logical connection between the wife's emotional state and the game, and Output (b) is unrelated to the given instruction.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) attempts to follow the instruction by completing a brief story, but Output (b) does not.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) has better text quality and attempts to follow the instruction, but it lacks information richness and accuracy.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I am looking to write a sci-fi story. The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and coherent, with a clear flow of ideas. The language is fluent and free of spelling and grammatical errors. Output (b) is also well-structured, but the language is more technical and may be challenging for non-experts to understand.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides rich and detailed information, including examples and explanations. It also explores the possibility of silicon-based life, which is a relevant and interesting aspect of the scenario. Output (b) provides technical information about the gravitational potential well, but it is more focused on the scientific aspect and does not provide as much depth or detail as Output (a).\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) does a good job of inferring the user's intention and providing relevant information. It understands that the user is looking to write a sci-fi story and provides suggestions for the scenario. Output (b) is more focused on the scientific aspect and does not infer the user's intention as well.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their respective domains. Output (a) provides accurate information about the development of telescopes and the possibility of silicon-based life. Output (b) provides accurate information about the gravitational potential well and its relationship to the size and density of a planet.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to consider the possibility of a planet with life but lacking the resources for space flight. Output (a) provides a more comprehensive answer, exploring the possibilities of electric vehicles and metallurgy. Output (b) focuses more on the scientific aspect and does not provide as much depth or detail.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed answer that explores the possibilities of the scenario. It also does a better job of inferring the user's intention and providing relevant information. While Output (b) provides accurate and technical information, it is more focused on the scientific aspect and does not provide as much depth or detail as Output (a).", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n":

They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.", "output_2": "You can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).", "instruction": "is it possible for a planet to have life, but lack the resources for achieving space flight? I am looking to write a sci-fi story. The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her? Again, sorry for my bad english =/\n\n# Output (a):\nI want to tell my sister that she should avoid getting drunk with people she doesn't know or trust to avoid drowning risk, but I also want to make her aware that rape fear is a serious issue.\n\n# Output (b):\nI want to give some advice to my 17-year-old sister to avoid risky situations while drunk, without instilling rape fear or guilt in her. How would you advise me to phrase my advice?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end.

Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide relevant information, but Output (b) provides more specific and detailed advice on how to avoid risky situations while drunk.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) does not infer the user's intention clearly, as it only mentions avoiding drowning risk and rape fear without providing specific advice. Output (b) infers the user's intention by providing specific advice on how to avoid risky situations.\n\n4.

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nExplain: Pathos, Ethos, Logos \n\n# Output (a):\nEthos is the ethical appeal, which is used to convince an audience of the author's credibility or character. Pathos is the emotional appeal, which is used to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions. Logos is the appeal to logic and is used to convince an audience by the use of logic and reason.\n\n# Output (b):\nPathos is a tool of persuasion that is used to appeal to readers' emotions by arousing positive or negative feelings. It can be used in rhetoric, literature, film, and other forms of expression. While pathos is used to draw an emotional response, the other rhetorical appeals appeal to credibility and logic, respectively. Ethos is the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution. It is often evident as facts, numbers, or statistics and is used to convince an audience of an argument.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to explain the three rhetorical appeals, but Output (b) provides more comprehensive information.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile Output (a) is clear and concise, Output (b) provides more information and examples, making it a more comprehensive response.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

At the first bus stop, half of the people got down and 4 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got in.

Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. The language is simple and free of errors. Output (b) is also well-structured, but the language is slightly more formal and uses some technical terms like \"algebra\" and \"equation\", which might make it less accessible to some readers.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide sufficient information to solve the problem, but Output (a) provides more context and explanations, making it easier to understand the steps involved in solving the problem. Output (b) is more concise and focuses on the mathematical solution.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs provide accurate solutions to the problem. Output (a) uses a step-by-step approach to solve the problem, while Output (b) uses algebraic equations.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instructions completely, providing a solution to the problem and answering the question.\n\nOverall, while both outputs are good, Output (a) is better because it provides more context and explanations, making it easier to understand the solution.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

She told us she was not to be upset. She was very upset. She joined the club.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and coherent, with a clear flow of ideas. The sentences are simple and easy to understand. Output (b) is not well-structured, with sentences that seem unrelated to each other. The text quality of Output (b) is poor.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither Output (a) nor Output (b) provides rich or detailed information. The instruction asks for a brief story, and both outputs are brief and to the point. However, Output (a) provides some context and a clear storyline, while Output (b) seems to be unrelated to the initial sentence.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the initial sentence, which asks for a brief story. Neither Output (a) nor Output (b) attempts to infer the user's intention or ask for clarification.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) are accurate in terms of grammar and spelling. However, Output (a) provides a coherent and logical storyline, while Output (b) seems to be unrelated to the initial sentence.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction by providing a brief story, while Output (b) does not. Output (a) also provides a clear storyline, while Output (b) seems to be unrelated to the initial sentence.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) is a better response because it provides a coherent and logical storyline, follows the instruction by providing a brief story, and has good text quality.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here? I don't really know anything about finance, or what's actually going on. I really want to help my parents, but at the same time I have to protect myself too.\n\n# Output (a):\nI'm a student in Ireland. I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy mom asked me to hide her \u20ac12,000 savings from the bank so that the bank doesn't know about it. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster. Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1.

Output (b) provides more specific information about the author's experience with an engineering physics degree and their current research in photonics.\n\n3.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nHow do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity? \n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Output (b):\nVaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of a virus or bacteria, or parts of its structure such as proteins, into a person's body. The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is clear and concise, but lacks proper sentence structure and contains minor grammatical errors. Output (b) is well-structured, fluent, and free of errors, making it more readable and easier to understand.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide a good overview of how vaccinations work, but Output (b) provides more detailed information about the immune system's response to vaccination, including the production of antibodies and memory cells. Output (a) only briefly mentions the immune system's response.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the instruction, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs provide accurate information about vaccinations and herd immunity. However, Output (b) provides more accurate and detailed information about the immune system's response to vaccination.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs provide a good overview of how vaccinations work and what herd immunity is, but Output (b) provides more detailed information and a clearer explanation of the immune system's response to vaccination.\n\nOverall, while Output (a) is clear and concise, Output (b) provides more detailed and accurate information about the immune system's response to vaccination, making it a better overall response. The importance of accuracy and completeness in following the instruction cannot be overstated, as it is crucial to provide reliable and trustworthy information about vaccinations and herd immunity.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\"", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.4624466300010681}, {"1": -3.6954811548639555e-06}, {".": -2.8013790142722428e-05}, {" Text": -4.768370445162873e-07}, {"

These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

To maintain the sovereignty and well-being of this revered land, I solemnly pledge my sword and honor. Bound by the code of chivalry, I vow to uphold justice, bring solace to the distressed, and safeguard the realm for all present and future generations. I invite you to rejoice in our mutual fellowship and indulge in the festivities of this magnificent royal banquet.\n\n# Output (b):\nAs a medieval knight, I would introduce myself at a royal banquet with a deep bow and a respectful speech, acknowledging my humble origins and my loyalty to the crown. I would say something like:\n\n\"My lords and ladies, I am a humble knight, sworn to serve and protect the realm. I come from a long line of warriors who have fought to defend this kingdom for generations. I am honored to be here today, in the presence of such an esteemed company, and I hope to earn your trust and respect with my deeds and actions. I pledge my sword, my shield, and my life to the service of my king and my people.\"\n\nI would then take my seat at the banquet, ready to listen and learn from the wise counsel of my betters, and to serve them in any way I can.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and fluent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. The language is formal and respectful, suitable for a royal banquet. Output (b) is also well-written, but the language is slightly more casual and the structure is less formal.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more information about the knight's pledge and commitment to the realm, which is relevant to the instruction. Output (b) is more concise and focuses on the knight's humble origins and loyalty to the crown.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate and correct in their representation of a medieval knight's introduction at a royal banquet.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to introduce themselves in the tone of a medieval knight at a royal banquet, but Output (a) provides more details and a more elaborate introduction.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) is more elaborate and provides more information about the knight's pledge and commitment to the realm, which is relevant to the instruction. However, Output (b) is more concise and focuses on the knight's humble origins and loyalty to the crown, which is also important. Considering the importance of each aspect, I weigh the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I am now doing a short internship abroad for 3 months, and he is planning on visiting.

I know the easier thing to do would be not never tell them he visited, and to enjoy his company without having to deal with family drama. But is this a cop-out?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy boyfriend is visiting me while I'm in Europe, and I don't know if I should tell my parents about it.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy Indian parents disapprove of my white boyfriend for his ethnicity and will probably be upset if he visits me while I'm abroad. Should I tell them about his visit, or just enjoy his company without dealing with family drama?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more information about the situation, including the parents' disapproval of the boyfriend's ethnicity and the potential consequences of not telling them about the visit. Output (a) only mentions the visit and the uncertainty about whether to tell the parents.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) shows a better understanding of the user's intention, as it infers the potential consequences of not telling the parents about the visit and provides a more nuanced perspective on the situation.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nComplete a brief story given the following first sentence: We went to a dinner and show one night.\n\n# Output (a):\nWe left the fridge to get to make him think he would not. He laughed when he said he might buy a pizza. We went to the right nearby place. He had won the contest and enjoyed dinner.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere were just six people at the dinner. The show's DJ was very inviting, but only for one person. He played a duet with a few other people. It ended up being good.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) has some grammatical errors, such as \"We left the fridge to get to make him think he would not\", which seems unrelated to the context of the dinner and show. Output (b) is well-structured and free of errors, making it easier to follow.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides some information about the dinner and show, but it lacks detail and context. Output (b) provides more information about the show, including the number of people and the DJ's performance.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, so neither output is able to infer the user's intention accurately.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs have some inaccuracies. Output (a) seems to be unrelated to the context of the dinner and show, while Output (b) does not provide accurate information about the dinner.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction asks for a brief story, and both outputs are incomplete and lack a clear narrative. Output (a) seems to be a collection of unrelated sentences, while Output (b) is more focused on the show, but still lacks a clear story.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile Output (a) has some potential for creativity, it lacks coherence and accuracy. Output (b) is more focused on the show, but lacks detail and context. Considering the importance of accuracy and completeness in following the instruction, I would say that Output (b) is more coherent and follows the instruction better, but it still lacks detail and context.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Output (b) is also well-structured, but it lacks clarity in stating the company with the highest profit margin.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide some information, but Output (a) provides more context and notes that other companies also reported significant profits. Output (b) only focuses on Company Z and does not provide additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear in this instruction, which is to identify the company with the highest profit margin. Both outputs infer this intention correctly.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) contains an error in stating the company with the highest profit, while Output (b) accurately identifies Company Z as the one with the highest profit margin.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction correctly, but Output (a) does not provide the correct answer.\n\nBased on the evaluation, Output (b) is better because it accurately identifies the company with the highest profit margin and provides a clear answer.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

We have been in a relationship for 2 years and have been best friends for 2 before that. He loves always having plans and hanging out with people, which I also sometimes enjoy doing but I also need nights where we can just stay in and watch movies or do nothing. Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns. How do I get him to see my point of view?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy boyfriend and I are always busy and I need a night in. He thinks I'm being lazy and doesn't understand why I need a night in.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy boyfriend is an extrovert and loves to hang out with friends, I am an introvert and need nights alone to relax. He doesn't understand my need for a night in, and it puts me under stress. How do I get him to understand?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him.

This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\".

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGenerate two rhymes for the following word. Moon\n\n# Output (a):\nSoon, Loon\n\n# Output (b):\nClone, June, Nore, Tune\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors, making it easy to read and understand. Output (b) is also well-structured, but it contains four rhymes instead of the requested two, which makes it slightly less coherent.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the instruction is to generate two rhymes for the given word.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) provide accurate rhymes for the word \"Moon\". However, Output (b) contains four rhymes instead of the requested two, which makes it less accurate in following the instruction.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) precisely follows the instruction by providing two rhymes for the given word. Output (b) does not follow the instruction as it provides four rhymes instead of the requested two.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nIn this case, the importance of each aspect is as follows: Completeness of Instruction Following (most important), Accuracy, Text Quality, and Information Richness (least important). Output (a) excels in Completeness of Instruction Following and Accuracy, while Output (b) falls short in these aspects. Although Output (b) has a slightly better Text Quality, it is not enough to outweigh its shortcomings in the other aspects.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is concise and directly answers the question, but lacks clarity and structure. Output (b) is more descriptive and provides a clear explanation of the sentiment type and score. Output (b) has a better text quality.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide the required information, but Output (b) provides more details by specifying the sentiment type as \"Positive\" and providing a score of 9.5 out of 10. Output (b) is more informative.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the instruction, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs provide accurate information, but Output (b) provides more accurate information by specifying the sentiment type and score.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs directly answer the question and provide the required information, so they both follow the instruction completely.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) is concise but lacks clarity and structure, while Output (b) is more descriptive and provides more accurate information.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Output (b):\nA neural network can be used for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs. The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training. Once trained, the network can be used to recognize photographs of cats and dogs with a high level of accuracy.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a rich and detailed response, including a specific neural network architecture, code, and explanations. Output (b) provides a general overview of a neural network, but lacks specific details and code.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, which is to create a neural network for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs. Both outputs infer the user's intention correctly.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) provides accurate information about the neural network architecture and code, while Output (b) lacks specific details and accuracy.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction by providing a specific neural network architecture and code, while Output (b) does not provide specific details and code.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it provides a well-structured and coherent response with a clear flow of ideas, rich and detailed information, accurate information, and follows the instruction completely.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nExplain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Output (b):\nSelf-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides some relevant information about self-supervised learning, but it lacks depth and detail. Output (b) provides more detailed and professional information, including specific benefits and examples.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4.

In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Information Richness:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the instruction is to combine two sentences with a correct relationship between them, without requiring additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGenerate a 5-sentence story about a person walking through a forest.\n\n# Output (a):\nIt was a sunny day in the woods when John decided to go for a walk.\nHe wandered through the towering trees, the heavy undergrowth, and across a sun-dappled meadow.\nBirds sang from the treetops and a gentle cool breeze blew.\nHe continued his journey until he reached the edge of the forest, where he saw a small cottage in a clearing when he stopped and thought about how peaceful and beautiful the forest was and how he had discovered a hidden world.\nHe was content to leave it in peace, but it was a nice reminder that there was beauty in nature all around us.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe person was walking on a sunny day.\nThe leaves rustled beneath their feet as they walked, and birds flew in circles around them.\nThe path curved around a small clearing, revealing a small pond of clear water.\nAs they continued walking, they noticed rocks arranged in a particular formation, giving them no indication of their presence.\nFinally, the person reached a large boulder that covered the mouth of a cave.\nThey snuck inside to find a small hidden village lying in darkness.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) has a more fluent and well-structured narrative, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. The sentences are coherent and easy to follow. Output (b) has some grammatical errors and the sentences are not as well-structured, making it harder to follow.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed and descriptive information about the forest, including the sounds, sights, and feelings experienced by the person. Output (b) provides some information about the environment, but it is more sparse and lacks the level of detail provided by Output (a).\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their descriptions of the forest environment.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) provides a 5-sentence story as instructed, while Output (b) does not provide a complete story, as it stops abruptly after describing the cave. Output (a) also provides a more complete and satisfying conclusion to the story.\n\nOverall, while both outputs have some strengths, Output (a) excels in terms of text quality, information richness, and completeness of instruction following. Output (a) provides a more engaging and detailed story that meets the user's request, while Output (b) falls short in these areas. Therefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.5953873991966248}, {"1": -3.814689989667386e-06}, {".": -2.7894584491150454e-05}, {" Text": -4.768370445162873e-07}, {" Quality":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is concise but lacks clarity, as it does not explicitly state what \"cloud hosting\" refers to. Output (b) is more direct and clear in its explanation of cloud computing.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide a brief summary of cloud computing, but Output (b) is more accurate in its description, as it specifically mentions \"store and manage data and applications\" which is a key aspect of cloud computing.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nNeither output requires inference, as the instruction is clear and specific.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) is more accurate in its description of cloud computing, as it correctly states that businesses can store and manage data and applications on internet-hosted servers.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to rewrite the sentence in a more concise way, but Output (b) is more complete in its description, as it includes the key aspects of cloud computing.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile Output (a) is concise, it lacks clarity and accuracy.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors, making it easy to understand. Output (b) is also well-written, but it could be improved by providing more context or explanation for the conversion. Both outputs are coherent and have a clear flow of ideas.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides some information about the conversion process, but it could be more detailed. Output (b) directly provides the converted date, which is more helpful for the user. However, it lacks additional information about the conversion process.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is accurate in stating that the Julian date is 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar. Output (b) is also accurate in providing the converted date.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction by converting the date from the Gregorian calendar to the Julian calendar. However, Output (b) provides a more direct and helpful answer.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile both outputs are accurate and well-written, Output (b) is more helpful and provides a more direct answer to the user's question. The conversion process is not explained in detail, but the output is still clear and easy to understand. Output (a) provides some additional information, but it is not as relevant to the user's question.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.1607150286436081}, {"1":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) does not provide a function that generates an array of random numbers, it simply creates a list of numbers from 1 to 100. Output (b) provides a function that generates an array of random numbers from 1 to 100. Therefore, Output (b) has better text quality.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) does not provide any additional information, it only creates a list of numbers. Output (b) provides a function that can be used to generate an array of random numbers, which is more informative. Therefore, Output (b) has better information richness.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, which is to create a function that generates an array of random numbers. Both Output (a) and Output (b) fulfill this intention. Therefore, this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is not accurate because it does not provide a function that generates random numbers. Output (b) is accurate because it provides a function that generates an array of random numbers. Therefore, Output (b) has better accuracy.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction asks to create a complete function that generates an array of random numbers. Output (a) does not provide a function, while Output (b) provides a complete function that fulfills the instruction. Therefore, Output (b) has better completeness of instruction following.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (b) has better text quality, information richness, accuracy, and completeness of instruction following. Output (a) does not provide a function that generates random numbers, which is the main requirement of the instruction. Therefore, Output (b) is better.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.0471242293715477}, {"1": -1.5497195136049413e-06}, {".": -3.158996332786046e-05}, {" Text":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

She is lonely and homesick and feels like no one understands her. She is having a hard time adjusting to her new surroundings and is feeling down in the dumps.\n\n# Output (b):\nA hypothetical situation in which a person is feeling sad could be an unexpected change at work, such as a reduction in pay or loss of a job. It could also be a sudden break-up with a partner or a death in the family. Other common triggers are feeling left out or neglected by friends, or feeling isolated and alone.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. However, the writing is not particularly fluent, and the sentence structure is simple. Output (b) is also well-structured, but the writing is more concise and clear.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a specific and detailed hypothetical situation, but it is limited to one scenario. Output (b) provides a broader range of hypothetical situations, including unexpected changes at work, personal relationships, and family events.\n\n3.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) provides a complete hypothetical situation, but it is limited to one scenario. Output (b) provides a more comprehensive range of hypothetical situations, but it does not provide a specific and detailed scenario.\n\nOverall, while Output (a) provides a clear and coherent hypothetical situation, Output (b) provides a more comprehensive and accurate range of hypothetical situations.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors, making it easy to read and understand. Output (b) is also grammatically correct, but it lacks a clear structure and is quite brief. Output (a) wins in this aspect.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides helpful and relevant information by suggesting possible actions to take when a bag is lost, such as searching for it or notifying authorities. Output (b) only expresses sympathy, but does not provide any practical advice or suggestions. Output (a) is more informative and helpful.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is not explicitly stated, but Output (a) makes a reasonable inference by suggesting possible actions to take when a bag is lost. Output (b) does not make any inference and simply expresses sympathy. Output (a) is more responsive to the user's potential needs.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate and do not contain any incorrect information.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction is to give a helpful response, and both outputs aim to do so. However, Output (a) provides more specific and practical advice, while Output (b) is more general and lacks concrete suggestions. Output (a) is more complete in following the instruction.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it provides a well-structured and informative response that is helpful and accurate. It also makes a reasonable inference about the user's needs and provides specific suggestions for what to do next. Output (b) is more general and lacks concrete advice, making it less helpful and responsive to the user's needs.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWhat is the purpose of the `key` argument in the Python sorted() function and what should I pass as inputs?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to define a key for sorting. It is used to tell the function how to compare two strings to determine which one should be placed before the other in the sorted output.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to specify a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the input iterable. The items are then sorted based on the values returned by this function.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is not fluent and lacks coherence, making it difficult to understand. Output (b) is well-structured and easy to comprehend, with a clear flow of ideas.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more detailed and accurate information about the `key` argument in the Python sorted() function, including its purpose and how it works. Output (a) only provides a brief and vague description.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) is more accurate in its description of the `key` argument, while Output (a) contains some inaccuracies.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction by providing information about the `key` argument, but Output (b) provides more comprehensive and accurate information.\n\nOverall, while Output (a) has some strengths, Output (b) excels in terms of text quality, information richness, accuracy, and completeness of instruction following. Therefore, Output (b) is better.\"", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.0986185222864151}, {"1": -1.311301275563892e-06}, {".": -2.4676019165781327e-05}, {" Text": -4.768370445162873e-07}, {" Quality":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGiven a base number and a power, calculate the result.\n\nBase:5   Power:3\n\n# Output (a):\n5 x 5 x 5 = 625\n\n# Output (b):\n125\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors, making it easy to read and understand. Output (b) is a single number without any explanation or context, which makes it less clear and less helpful.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a clear and detailed calculation of the result, which is relevant to the instruction. Output (b) only provides a single number without any context or explanation, which is less informative.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) accurately calculates the result of the given base and power, while Output (b) does not provide any calculation or explanation, making it difficult to verify its accuracy.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction by providing a calculation of the result, while Output (b) does not provide any calculation or explanation, making it incomplete in following the instruction.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) excels in terms of text quality, information richness, accuracy, and completeness of instruction following, while Output (b) lacks in these aspects.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGenerate a realistic mathematical equation for the students to solve.\n\n# Output (a):\nx+4 = 5\nwhere x is a real number.\n\n# Output (b):\n2 + 2 = 4.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors, making it easy to read and understand. Output (b) is also free of errors, but it is a simple arithmetic equation that lacks context and clarity. Output (a) provides a realistic mathematical equation for students to solve, making it more relevant to the instruction.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a realistic mathematical equation that requires students to solve for the value of x, which is a common mathematical task. Output (b) is a simple arithmetic equation that does not provide any additional information or context.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) are accurate and correct, as they represent valid mathematical equations.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction by providing a realistic mathematical equation for students to solve, while Output (b) does not provide a mathematical equation that requires solving.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) is a more comprehensive and relevant response that meets the instruction's requirements, providing a realistic mathematical equation for students to solve.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors, making it easy to read and understand. Output (b) contains some words that are not typically used as synonyms for 'sad', and the text is not as coherent as Output (a).\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides 10 synonyms for 'sad', which is exactly what the instruction asks for. Output (b) provides 10 words, but they are not all synonyms for 'sad', and the instruction does not ask for a list of words that are not necessarily related to the concept of sadness.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4.

Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction by providing 10 synonyms for 'sad', while Output (b) does not follow the instruction by providing words that are not necessarily related to the concept of sadness.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it meets the criteria of text quality, information richness, accuracy, and completeness of instruction following.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) has a clear and concise introduction, with proper grammar and spelling. The sentence structure is simple and easy to follow. Output (b) is incomplete and lacks proper grammar, making it difficult to understand.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides relevant information about the speaker's background and expertise, which is useful for the audience. Output (b) does not provide any information about the speaker's background or expertise.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to provide a brief introduction about the speaker, and Output (a) meets this intention. Output (b) does not provide any information about the speaker, and it seems to be missing the point of the instruction.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is accurate in providing the speaker's name and profession. Output (b) is incomplete and lacks accuracy.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction asks for a 1-2 sentence introduction, and Output (a) meets this requirement. Output (b) is incomplete and does not follow the instruction.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is a more complete and accurate response that meets the user's intention and provides relevant information.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) have good text quality, with no spelling or grammatical errors. The structure is also clear and logical. However, Output (b) is slightly better in terms of text quality as it includes a space between the name and surname, making the output more readable.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case as the instruction does not ask for additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is also not applicable as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) are accurate in terms of the function's purpose, which is to greet the customer. However, Output (b) is more accurate in terms of the parameters it accepts, as it includes a surname parameter, which is more realistic in a real-world scenario.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) does not follow the instruction completely as it only accepts one parameter, whereas the instruction asks for two parameters. Output (b) follows the instruction completely as it accepts two parameters, name and surname.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nBased on the evaluation, Output (b) is better overall. Although Output (a) has good text quality, it does not follow the instruction completely, which is a critical aspect. Output (b) has good text quality, is accurate, and follows the instruction completely. Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.023795267567038536}, {"1": -1.9073468138230965e-06}, {".": -2.777537883957848e-05}, {" Text": -4.768370445162873e-07}, {" Quality":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGenerate a new headline from the following that is less clickbait. This One Trick Will Change Your Life!\n\n# Output (a):\nDiscover how simple changes can influence your life\n\n# Output (b):\nExperts Baffled: Discover the Single Secret that Can Revolutionize Your Life NOW!\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors, making it easy to read and understand. Output (b) contains sensational language and capitalization, which may be attention-grabbing but also makes it less professional and less readable.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the instruction is to generate a new headline, not to provide detailed information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, which is to generate a new headline that is less clickbait. Therefore, this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in terms of conveying the idea of a single trick or secret that can change one's life. However, Output (b) uses sensational language, which may be misleading or exaggerated.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to generate a new headline, but Output (a) is more straightforward and less clickbait, which is what the user is asking for.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) is a more professional and straightforward headline that accurately conveys the idea without sensational language. Output (b) is more attention-grabbing but also less accurate and less professional. While attention-grabbing headlines can be effective, in this case, the user is asking for a less clickbait headline, making Output (a) the better choice.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.",

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGroup the following items into two categories:\n\nmouse, keyboard, printer, screen\n\n# Output (a):\nmouse, keyboard, printer, screen\nGroup 1: Input device \nGroup 2: Output device\n\n# Output (b):\nInput devices: mouse, keyboard\nOutput devices: printer, screen\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) has some minor issues with sentence structure, but overall, the text is clear and easy to understand. Output (b) is well-structured and free of errors. Therefore, Output (b) has a slight edge in terms of text quality.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide the same information, which is the grouping of the given items into two categories. Since the instruction does not ask for additional information, this criterion is not applicable.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, which is to group the items into two categories. Therefore, this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately group the items into two categories. However, Output (b) is more explicit in its categorization, using \"Input devices\" and \"Output devices\" to clearly label the groups.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction by grouping the items into two categories. However, Output (b) is more explicit in its categorization, which makes it easier to understand.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile Output (a) has some minor issues with sentence structure, Output (b) is more explicit and accurate in its categorization. The importance of this criterion is higher in this context, as the user's intention is clearly expressed and the instruction is straightforward. Therefore, Output (b) is better.\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.03839343413710594}, {"1": -9.536738616588991e-07}, {".": -1.9073304429184645e-05}, {" Text":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is creative and uses vivid language, but it lacks proper grammar and punctuation. Output (b) is straightforward and uses proper grammar and punctuation. Output (a) is more artistic, but Output (b) is more clear and easy to understand.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide the same information, which is the woman's action of running quickly. There is no additional information provided in either output.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the instruction, which is to rewrite the sentence using a variety of grammar, punctuation, and structure. Both outputs fulfill this intention, but Output (a) is more creative and Output (b) is more straightforward.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately convey the woman's action of running quickly.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction by rewriting the sentence using a variety of grammar, punctuation, and structure. However, Output (a) is more creative and Output (b) is more straightforward.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nIn this evaluation, I considered the importance of each aspect. Text Quality and Information Richness are not as critical in this task, as the user's intention is clearly expressed and both outputs provide the same information. Accuracy and Completeness of Instruction Following are more important, as they ensure that the output accurately conveys the woman's action and follows the instruction. Considering these aspects, I conclude that Output (b) is better because it is more clear and easy to understand, while still following the instruction and providing accurate information. Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.11339446157217026}, {"1": -1.311301275563892e-06}, {".": -2.1576648578047752e-05}, {" Text": -3.576278118089249e-07}, {" Quality":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nConstruct a sentence using the words \"effervescence\", \"hesitant\" and \"integrity\".\n\n# Output (a):\nThe effervescence in the room helped to ease the hesitant nature of the individual.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe hesitant effervescence of his words gave away his integrity.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors, making it easy to understand. Output (b) has a slightly awkward sentence structure, which affects its coherence. Output (a) wins in this aspect.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither output provides additional information, as the instruction is to construct a sentence using the given words. This criterion is not applicable in this case.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs use the given words correctly, but Output (a) uses \"effervescence\" as a noun, which is more accurate in this context. Output (b) uses \"hesitant\" as an adjective, which is also correct.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction by using the given words to construct a sentence. However, Output (a) more closely follows the instruction by using \"effervescence\" as a noun, which is more in line with the user's intention.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) excels in text quality and accuracy, while Output (b) has a slightly awkward sentence structure. Although both outputs follow the instruction, Output (a) more closely follows the user's intention.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWrite an SQL query to find all words that start with the letter 'd'.\n\n# Output (a):\nSELECT word FROM words WHERE word = 'd';\n\n# Output (b):\nSELECT word FROM table WHERE word LIKE 'd%';\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) lacks proper syntax and structure, making it difficult to understand and execute. Output (b) has a clear and concise structure, making it easier to comprehend and execute.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide the necessary information to complete the task, but Output (b) provides more flexibility and accuracy by using the LIKE operator to find words that start with the letter 'd'.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nNeither output requires inference, as the user's intention is clearly expressed in the instruction.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is inaccurate as it will only return the word 'd' if it exists in the table, whereas Output (b) will return all words that start with the letter 'd'.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) does not follow the instruction as it does not specify the table to query, whereas Output (b) follows the instruction by specifying the table to query.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) lacks proper syntax and structure, and is inaccurate. Output (b) has a clear and concise structure, provides more flexibility and accuracy, and follows the instruction.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nDetermine the most common word in the text. Humans are created in the image of God, from a spiritual perspective and from a physical perspective.\n\n# Output (a):\n\"from\", \"a\", and \"perspective\"\n\n# Output (b):\nThe most common word in the text is \"humans\", which appears twice.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) lacks proper grammar and sentence structure, making it difficult to understand. Output (b) is well-written and easy to comprehend.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a list of words, but it does not provide any additional information or context. Output (b) provides a clear and concise answer that accurately answers the question.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is inaccurate, as it does not identify the most common word in the text. Output (b) accurately identifies the most common word as \"humans\".\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) does not follow the instruction, as it does not provide a single answer to the question. Output (b) follows the instruction by providing a clear and concise answer.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) fails to meet the criteria for text quality, information richness, and accuracy, while Output (b) excels in these areas.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nRead the following sentence and suggest one correction. I am going to the the store.\n\n# Output (a):\nI am going to the store.\n\n# Output (b):\nRemove one of the two adjacent \"the\"\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is a simple and clear sentence with no grammatical errors, making it well-structured and fluent. Output (b) is also grammatically correct, but it is a suggestion rather than a correction, which affects its coherence and relevance to the task.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this task, as the user is only asking for a correction.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this task, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) provides an accurate correction by removing the duplicate word \"the\", while Output (b) is a suggestion rather than a correction.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) precisely follows the instruction by providing a corrected sentence, while Output (b) does not provide a corrected sentence but rather a suggestion.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) is a more accurate and precise correction, which is the primary goal of the task. While Output (b) is a good suggestion, it is not a correction and does not meet the requirements of the task. Therefore, Output (a) is better.\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.07410846650600433}, {"1": -8.344646857949556e-07}, {".": -1.9073304429184645e-05}, {" Text":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nDescribe the look and feel of an ideal website.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe ideal website should have a clean, modern, and visually appealing look. It should have a well-organized layout with a consistent color scheme that aligns with the brand's identity. The website should also have a responsive design, meaning it should look good and function well on all devices.\n\nIn terms of feel, the website should be user-friendly and intuitive. The website should also make users feel secure, especially if they're required to enter personal information or make a purchase.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe ideal website content should be engaging, relevant, and tailored to the intended audience. It should offer high-quality, original information that is regularly updated to remain current. Multimedia elements like images, videos, and infographics should complement the text to enhance understanding and retain user interest. Clear, concise language and well-structured formatting, including short paragraphs, bullet points, and subheadings, make the content easily digestible. Above all, the content should provide genuine value to the user, addressing their needs or queries while maintaining authenticity and credibility.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear and concise description of the ideal website's look and feel. However, Output (b) is more verbose and lacks a clear structure, making it harder to understand. Output (a) wins in terms of text quality.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more detailed information about the ideal website's content, including the importance of multimedia elements and clear language. Output (a) only focuses on the website's design and layout. Output (b) is more informative.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their descriptions, but Output (b) provides more specific and detailed information about the ideal website's content.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) only partially follows the instruction, as it only describes the look and feel of the ideal website, whereas Output (b) provides a more comprehensive description of the ideal website's content.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile Output (a) excels in terms of text quality, Output (b) provides more informative and accurate content. However, Output (a) fails to fully follow the instruction, which is a significant drawback.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nClassify the following list as either a positive or negative emotion:  amazed, joyful, scared, excited\n\n# Output (a):\nAmazed - Positive, Joyful - Positive, Scared - Negative, Excited - Positive.\n\n# Output (b):\nAmazed, joyful, and excited all have positive sentiments.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and easy to read, with each emotion clearly labeled as positive or negative. Output (b) is concise but lacks clarity, as it does not explicitly state the classification of each emotion.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide the required information, but Output (a) provides more detailed information by explicitly stating the classification of each emotion, while Output (b) only provides a general statement.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) accurately classifies the emotions, while Output (b) does not provide explicit classifications, making it difficult to determine the accuracy.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction by providing the classification of each emotion, while Output (b) does not explicitly follow the instruction by not providing the classification of each emotion.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) excels in terms of text quality, information richness, and completeness of instruction following, while Output (b) lacks clarity and accuracy.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Output (b):\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is generally well-structured and coherent, but it lacks fluency and has some minor grammatical errors. Output (b) is also well-structured and coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas, and is free of grammatical errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides some information about the differences between Shakespearean and modern English, but it lacks specific examples and details. Output (b) provides a clear example of the differences between the two forms of English, using a quote from Romeo and Juliet, and also provides more detailed information about the characteristics of Shakespearean English.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs provide accurate information about the differences between Shakespearean and modern English, but Output (b) provides more specific and detailed information.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to describe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example, but Output (b) provides a more detailed and specific example.\n\nOverall, while both outputs have their strengths and weaknesses, Output (b) is better overall because it provides more detailed and specific information, is free of grammatical errors, and provides a clear and logical flow of ideas. Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.5068333148956299}, {"1": -3.933898824470816e-06}, {".": -2.7894584491150454e-05}, {" Text": -4.768370445162873e-07}, {" Quality":

language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.", "output_2": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"", "instruction": "Describe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nPlease tell me the grammatical structure of this sentence:\n\nWe start by providing a simple weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe grammatical structure of the sentence is a statement of fact.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) lacks clarity and coherence, as it simply states that the sentence is a statement of fact without providing any further explanation. Output (b) is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more information about the grammatical structure of the sentence, including the subject, verb phrase, object, and relative clause. Output (a) does not provide any additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their description of the grammatical structure of the sentence.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) fully follows the instruction by providing a detailed breakdown of the sentence's grammatical structure, while Output (a) only provides a vague statement.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it provides a clear and detailed explanation of the grammatical structure of the sentence, while Output (a) lacks clarity and coherence. The importance of each aspect in this case is as follows: Text Quality and Completeness of Instruction Following are crucial, as they directly impact the output's ability to fulfill the instruction. Information Richness is also important, as it provides additional value to the user. Accuracy is a given, as both outputs are accurate.

Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nI want to create a super-powered character with their own perks and background, and even a backstory. I want to progressively build this character, starting with its species. I want you to give me a list of 6 species that this character could be (e.g. human, demon, android, etc.) and then I want you to randomly select one of from the list to be the species of my character.\n\n# Output (a):\nSure! Here are 6 species that your character could be:\n\n1. Human\n2. Demon\n3. Cyborg\n4. Golem\n5. Elf\n6. Dwarf\n\n# Output (b):\nCertainly! Here are six species for your super-powered character:\n\n1. Elf\n2. Vampire\n3. Shapeshifter\n4. Cyborg\n5. Elemental\n6. Alien\n\nAnd now, let me randomly select one for your character... The chosen species for your character is... Shapeshifter! Your character is a shapeshifter with the ability to transform into different forms at will.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and easy to read, with a clear and concise list of species. Output (b) is also well-structured, but the list is slightly longer and includes more elaborate descriptions, which makes it slightly less concise.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more information about the species, including examples like Vampire and Elemental, which makes it more informative. Output (a) only provides a list of species without any additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs infer the user's intention correctly, providing a list of species for the character.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate, providing correct and existing species.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to provide a list of 6 species, but Output (b) also includes a random selection of the species, which is not explicitly mentioned in the instruction.\n\nOverall, while Output (a) is more concise and follows the instruction more closely, Output (b) provides more information and is more engaging. However, the random selection of the species in Output (b) is not explicitly mentioned in the instruction, which makes it less complete. Therefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.36027902364730835}, {"1": -1.9073468138230965e-06}, {".": -3.158996332786046e-05}, {" Text": -4.768370445162873e-07}, {" Quality":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and concise, providing a clear answer to the question. Output (b) is a single word that does not provide any explanation or context, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind the answer.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the instruction is asking for a simple answer.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) accurately identifies the word that does not belong to others, while Output (b) is incorrect and does not provide any explanation.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) fully answers the question and follows the instruction, while Output (b) does not provide a complete answer and does not follow the instruction.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) is the better choice because it accurately answers the question, is well-structured, and follows the instruction. Output (b) is incomplete and does not provide any explanation or context, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind the answer.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\"", "logprobs":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) has a more professional tone and is well-structured, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. The language is formal and free of spelling and grammatical errors. Output (b) has a more casual tone and is less structured, with a more conversational language that is prone to errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a more comprehensive overview of the Russian Revolution, covering its causes, key events, and outcomes. It also provides some context and background information. Output (b) focuses more on the personalities and drama surrounding the Revolution, with less attention to the historical context and details.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) does not infer the user's intention, as the instruction is clear and specific. Output (b) attempts to infer the user's intention by using a more conversational tone and asking rhetorical questions.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is more accurate in its historical facts and events, while Output (b) contains some inaccuracies and simplifications. For example, Output (b) states that the Russian Revolution took place in 1917, when it actually took place from 1914 to 1920.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction more closely, providing a detailed and comprehensive account of the Russian Revolution. Output (b) deviates from the instruction by focusing more on the personalities and drama surrounding the Revolution, rather than the historical context and events.\n\nOverall, while Output (b) is more engaging and entertaining, Output (a) is more accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured.

It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.", "output_2": "Oh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (a):\nThese people can\u2019t be trusted whatsoever, you should make a scene at his school to show people the consequences of their ill behavior.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit?

Maybe submitting a claim would get their attention?", "instruction": "Provide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nSon has a peanut allergy, and the school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts. This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe United States is a linguistically diverse country with over 350 languages spoken. The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) lacks coherence and logical flow of ideas, making it difficult to follow. The sentences are short and lack connection to each other. Output (b) has a clear and logical structure, with well-organized paragraphs and coherent sentences.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides more detailed and rich information about the languages spoken in the United States, including the historical context, regional variations, and cultural significance. Output (a) only provides a brief overview of the languages spoken, without providing any additional context or information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs provide accurate information about the languages spoken in the United States. However, Output (b) provides more accurate information about the historical context and cultural significance of the languages.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) follows the instruction more closely, providing a detailed compare-and-contrast essay about the languages spoken in the United States. Output (a) only provides a brief overview of the languages spoken, without following the instruction to compare and contrast.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (b) is a more comprehensive and detailed response that provides a clear and logical structure, rich information, and accurate data. It also follows the instruction more closely, providing a detailed compare-and-contrast essay. Output (a) lacks coherence, provides limited information, and does not follow the instruction as closely.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nDo you know of anyone who was unable to become an engineer despite getting the degree and their best efforts? Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) lacks coherence and logical flow of ideas, making it difficult to follow. The response is also quite brief and does not provide any substantial information. Output (b) is well-structured, fluent, and provides clear and concise information.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) does not provide any additional information or insights, whereas Output (b) offers three valuable suggestions for the individual to consider.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) does not demonstrate any understanding of the user's intention or concerns, whereas Output (b) addresses the user's fears and provides relevant advice.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their statements, but Output (b) provides more accurate and relevant information.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) does not fully address the user's concerns and does not provide any specific advice, whereas Output (b) provides three actionable suggestions.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is a more comprehensive and helpful response that addresses the user's concerns and provides valuable advice. It is well-structured, provides relevant information, and demonstrates an understanding of the user's intention. Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.8052799701690674}, {"1": -5.364403477869928e-06}, {".": -3.6000557884108275e-05}, {" Text": -8.344646857949556e-07}, {" Quality":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

However, Output (a) provides a more detailed and accurate explanation, making it a more complete response.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) excels in terms of text quality, information richness, and accuracy, providing a clear and detailed explanation of the equation. Output (b) lacks clarity and accuracy, making it a less desirable response. Therefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.05843472108244896}, {"1": -2.622600959512056e-06}, {".": -2.1815061700181104e-05}, {" Text": -3.576278118089249e-07}, {" Quality":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Describe the background image, text positions, text contents, etc.\n\n# Output (a):\nPoster: Save Electricity, Illuminate Tomorrow**\n\n**Background Image:**\nThe background image depicts a serene and beautiful planet Earth seen from space, with a bright, radiant sun on one side symbolizing energy. The Earth is surrounded by a gentle glow, emphasizing the importance of preserving our planet's resources.\n\n**Text Positions:**\n1. **Title:** Centered at the top of the poster in bold and vibrant letters:\n   \"Save Electricity, Illuminate Tomorrow\"\n\n2. **Slogan:** Just below the title, in a slightly smaller font:\n   \"Empower Change, Conserve Energy\"\n\n3. **Main Message:** Positioned in the middle of the poster, in a larger font:\n   \"Join the Movement! Be a Watt-saver.\"\n\n4. **Tips for Saving Electricity:** Aligned horizontally across the bottom of the poster, each tip bulleted:\n   - \"Switch off lights when not in use.\"\n   - \"Unplug chargers to prevent energy wastage.\"\n   - \"Use energy-efficient appliances.\"\n   - \"Opt for natural light during the day.\"\n\n\n# Output (b):\nSave Energy: Unplug unwanted electronics. Use energy-saving bulbs. Use natural light whenever possible. Turn off electronics and appliances when not in use. Turn down the thermostat a few degrees. The poster aims to quickly convey the message that individual actions to save electricity today contribute to a brighter and sustainable future for everyone. The split image visually contrasts the choices we make now with the positive outcomes we can achieve. Remember, a successful poster communicates the message clearly and concisely while capturing the viewer's attention. The \"Brighten Tomorrow, Conserve Today\" concept emphasizes the urgency and rewards of energy conservation in a visually impactful way.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) has a clear and logical flow of ideas, with well-structured text and no spelling or grammatical errors. The text is also coherent and easy to follow. Output (b) has a good structure, but the text is a bit concise and lacks a clear flow of ideas. The text is also not entirely free of errors, with a few minor mistakes.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed information, including specific tips and examples, which makes it more informative and helpful. Output (b) is more concise and lacks specific details, making it less informative.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate and correct in their information.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction more closely, providing a detailed description of the poster design, including the background image, text positions, and text contents. Output (b) is more concise and lacks specific details about the poster design.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) excels in terms of text quality, information richness, and completeness of instruction following.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is a simple sentence with a clear structure, but it lacks coherence and logical flow. Output (b) is a sentence with a clear and logical flow, but it has a slightly awkward structure. Both outputs are free of spelling and grammatical errors. Overall, Output (b) has a slightly better text quality due to its more coherent structure.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) only provides a single example sentence, which is not rich in information. Output (b) provides a more detailed example sentence with multiple features, which is richer in information. However, the instruction only asks for an example sentence, so Output (a) meets the requirement.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, which is to combine the given words into an example sentence. Neither output requires inference or clarification.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately combine the given words, but Output (b) provides a more detailed and realistic example sentence.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction by providing a single example sentence, while Output (b) also provides a single example sentence but with more details. Both outputs meet the requirement.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile Output (a) has a slightly better text quality, Output (b) provides richer information and a more accurate example sentence. The importance of each aspect is weighed, and it is clear that the instruction prioritizes providing a good example sentence.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGive me ten prime numbers, sorted from smallest onwards, starting with the smallest prime number possible.\n\n# Output (a):\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\n\n# Output (b):\nCertainly, here are ten prime numbers sorted from smallest onwards, starting with the smallest prime number: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is a simple list of numbers without any additional information, whereas Output (b) provides a brief introduction and a clear statement of what the list contains. Output (b) is more well-structured and provides a better flow of ideas.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide the same information, which is the list of prime numbers. However, Output (b) provides a bit more information by including the starting point of the list, which is the smallest prime number possible. This adds some value to the output.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the instruction, which is to provide a list of prime numbers. Both outputs infer this intention correctly.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs provide accurate information, which is the list of prime numbers. However, Output (a) is more concise and accurate in terms of providing the correct numbers.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction correctly, providing a list of ten prime numbers sorted from smallest onwards. However, Output (b) does not start with the smallest prime number possible, which is 2.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile both outputs have their strengths and weaknesses, Output (a) is more accurate and concise in terms of providing the correct numbers. However, Output (b) provides a bit more information by including the starting point of the list. Considering the importance of accuracy and completeness in following the instruction, I would say that Output (a) is better overall.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) provides a clear and concise description of each public figure, including their occupation and relevant information. The text is well-structured and free of errors.

Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more information about each public figure, including their occupation and relevant details. Output (b) only lists the names of the public figures without providing any additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nWhat is an antonym for the word \"cogent\"?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe antonym of the word \"cogent\" is \"irrelevant\".\n\n# Output (b):\nunconvincing\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is a simple sentence with no grammatical or spelling errors, making it fluent and well-structured. Output (b) is also a single word with no errors, but it lacks context and clarity. Both outputs are coherent, but Output (a) provides a clear explanation of the antonym.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user is asking for a single antonym.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) provides an antonym that is somewhat related to the meaning of \"cogent\", but it is not entirely accurate. \"Irrelevant\" does not necessarily convey the opposite meaning of \"cogent\", which implies being logical and convincing. Output (b) is a single word that is not an antonym, but it is more accurate in conveying the opposite meaning of \"cogent\", which is unconvincing.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs provide a single antonym, which is what the user asked for. However, Output (a) does not fully execute the instruction, as it does not provide an antonym that accurately conveys the opposite meaning of \"cogent\".\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile Output (a) is well-structured and coherent, it lacks accuracy in providing an antonym. Output (b) is more accurate, but lacks context and clarity. Considering the importance of accuracy in this case, I weigh it more heavily. Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.09504931420087814}, {"1": -1.311301275563892e-06}, {".": -2.4437606043647975e-05}, {" Text": -3.576278118089249e-07}, {" Quality":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Inflation\n\n# Output (a):\nInflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. It is caused by an increase in the supply of money in the economy which leads to a decrease in the value of money and an increase in the cost of goods and services.\n\n# Output (b):\nInflation is like when you're blowing up a balloon. The more air you put in, the bigger it gets. Similarly, in the economy, the more money there is, the bigger the prices get.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors, making it easy to understand. Output (b) uses an analogy, but it is not as clear and concise as Output (a).\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a detailed explanation of inflation, including its causes and effects. Output (b) uses an analogy, but it does not provide as much information about the concept.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) accurately defines inflation and explains its causes. Output (b) uses an analogy, but it is not entirely accurate, as inflation is not directly comparable to blowing up a balloon.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs define inflation in simple terms, as instructed. However, Output (a) provides a more comprehensive explanation, while Output (b) relies on an analogy.\n\nOverall, while Output (b) is creative and engaging, Output (a) is more accurate, informative, and well-structured.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is a simple and straightforward response that is easy to understand. However, it lacks depth and does not provide any additional information. Output (b) is a bit more informative, providing the origin of the phrase, but it is not directly related to the question.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) does not provide any additional information, while Output (b) provides some context about the phrase. However, the context is not directly related to the question, and the response does not answer the question.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, and both outputs do not require any inference.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their own way. Output (a) provides a correct answer to the question, while Output (b) provides accurate information about the origin of the phrase.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction is to \"talk about Who wears short shorts?\", and both outputs do not fully follow the instruction. Output (a) provides a partial answer, while Output (b) does not answer the question at all.\n\nOverall, while Output (a) provides a correct answer to the question, it does not provide any additional information or context.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) lacks fluency and coherence, with a clear bias towards a creative but impractical solution. The writing is not well-structured, and the flow of ideas is not logical. Output (b) is well-structured and coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (b) provides a comprehensive list of potential organizational changes, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, and using project management tools. Output (a) only provides a single, creative but impractical solution.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (b) clearly infers the user's intention to provide a comprehensive list of potential solutions, while Output (a) does not infer the user's intention and instead provides a single, creative but impractical solution.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) provides accurate and correct information about potential organizational changes, while Output (a) provides a creative but impractical solution that is not accurate or correct.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (b) follows the instruction to provide a comprehensive list of potential organizational changes, while Output (a) does not follow the instruction and instead provides a single, creative but impractical solution.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it provides a comprehensive list of potential organizational changes, is well-structured and coherent, accurately infers the user's intention, and follows the instruction to provide a comprehensive list of potential solutions. Output (a) lacks fluency and coherence, provides a single, creative but impractical solution, and does not accurately infer the user's intention.

organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs.

The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.", "output_2": "There are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.", "instruction": "I work at a fully remote software company that has multiple, functional departments that work on different projects that span across the organization.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Output (b) is more complete in following the instruction.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) lacks in terms of text quality, information richness, and completeness of instruction following.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is concise and straightforward, providing a clear answer to the question. Output (b) is also brief, but it is incorrect. Both outputs lack additional information or explanations, but Output (a) is more accurate.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither Output (a) nor Output (b) provides additional information or explanations, as the instruction is simple and straightforward. However, Output (a) is more accurate and provides a correct answer.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, which is to determine if the given number is prime. Both outputs infer the user's intention correctly, but Output (a) provides a more accurate answer.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is accurate, stating that 17 is a prime number. Output (b) is inaccurate, stating that 17 is not a prime number.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction by providing a direct answer to the question. However, Output (a) is more accurate and provides a correct answer.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nThe most important aspect in this evaluation is accuracy, as the instruction is to detect if the given number is prime. Output (a) is more accurate and provides a correct answer, while Output (b) is inaccurate. Although both outputs lack additional information or explanations, Output (a) is more helpful in providing a correct answer.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nCan you provide a syntactic inversion of the following sentence?\nThe trees were covered with snow.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe trees were not covered with snow.\n\n# Output (b):\nCovered with snow were the trees.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is grammatically correct and well-structured, but lacks clarity and coherence. Output (b) is also grammatically correct, but its sentence structure is unusual and may be difficult to understand. Both outputs have no spelling or grammatical errors.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nThis criterion is not applicable as the instruction is asking for a specific task, syntactic inversion, and does not require additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is accurate in terms of grammar and syntax, but does not provide the correct syntactic inversion. Output (b) provides the correct syntactic inversion, but its sentence structure is unusual.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) does not follow the instruction as it does not provide the correct syntactic inversion. Output (b) follows the instruction by providing the correct syntactic inversion.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nBased on the evaluation, Output (b) is better than Output (a) as it provides the correct syntactic inversion, even though its sentence structure is unusual. The importance of accuracy and completeness of instruction following in this task is higher than the importance of text quality and information richness. Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.07015340775251389}, {"1": -1.4305104514278355e-06}, {".": -2.455681169521995e-05}, {" Text": -3.576278118089249e-07}, {" Quality":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

For example, a neural network can be used to tell you if an image is showing a cat or a dog. What are the basic mathematical requirements needed to get into neural networks? Please give me the basic requirements as completely as possible. Note that I don't mean to be an expert but a good AI engineer.\n\n# Output (a):\nHaving a basic understanding of the math behind neural networks is really important to understand how they work in case you need to debug or optimize your algorithm. It would be better to have a good understanding of some mathematics topics:\n\n1. Numbers and counting: Numbers can be thought of as the building blocks of mathematics. There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events. It is a way pivotal part of many areas of mathematics, science, technology, and more. It is also helpful for simply interacting with other people and the world around us. Everyday examples of measurements include height, weight, temperature, and distance.\n\n# Output (b):\nGenerally, you should have a good understanding of:\n- linear algebra, especially of matrix operations\n- calculus, including computing derivatives\n- probabilities and statistics\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and coherent, with a clear flow of ideas. However, it lacks precision and accuracy in its explanations, using vague terms like \"numbers and counting\" and \"rules and properties\". Output (b) is concise and to the point, providing specific mathematical requirements.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides some general information about numbers, arithmetic, data, and measurement, but it lacks depth and detail. Output (b) provides specific and relevant information about linear algebra, calculus, and probabilities, which are crucial for understanding neural networks.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) lacks accuracy in its explanations, while Output (b) provides accurate and relevant information about the mathematical requirements for neural networks.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) does not fully follow the instruction, as it does not provide the basic mathematical requirements needed to get into neural networks. Output (b) provides a concise and accurate list of the required mathematical topics.\n\nOverall, Output (b) is better because it provides accurate and relevant information about the mathematical requirements for neural networks, while Output (a) lacks precision and accuracy in its explanations. Output (b) also fully follows the instruction, providing a concise and complete list of the required mathematical topics.

There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision.

Text Quality:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. However, Output (a) uses the word \"charitable\" which is not a suitable synonym for \"generous\". Output (b) uses the word \"bountiful\" which is a more accurate synonym. Therefore, Output (b) has a slight edge in terms of text quality.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nThis criterion is not applicable as the instruction is asking for a simple replacement of words.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) uses the word \"charitable\" which is not a suitable synonym for \"generous\". Output (b) uses the word \"bountiful\" which is a more accurate synonym. Therefore, Output (b) is more accurate.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) precisely execute the instruction by replacing the word in brackets with a suitable synonym.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile both outputs are well-structured and free of errors, Output (b) has a slight edge in terms of text quality and accuracy. The word \"bountiful\" is a more accurate synonym for \"generous\" than \"charitable\". Therefore, Output (b) is better.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.03312014043331146}, {"1": -1.311301275563892e-06}, {".": -3.158996332786046e-05}, {" Text":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nAnalyze given speech for sentiment:\nI'm so grateful for the help and support that I received from my family.\n\n# Output (a):\nNegative sentiment\n\n# Output (b):\nPositive sentiment.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) lacks clarity and coherence, as it simply states \"Negative sentiment\" without providing any explanation or justification. Output (b) is more concise and clear, stating \"Positive sentiment\" with a clear and direct answer.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nNeither Output (a) nor Output (b) provides any additional information or examples to support their claims. However, Output (b) is more accurate and relevant to the instruction, as it correctly identifies the sentiment in the given speech.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (b) accurately identifies the sentiment in the given speech as positive, while Output (a) incorrectly identifies it as negative.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) follow the instruction by providing a sentiment analysis, but Output (b) is more accurate and relevant.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile both outputs are concise, Output (b) is more accurate and relevant to the instruction, making it a better choice. The importance of accuracy and relevance in sentiment analysis cannot be overstated, as it directly affects the quality of the output.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nRevise the following statement so that it is grammatically correct:\nThe history of the United Sates are full of remarkable milestones\n\n# Output (a):\nThe history of the United States are full of remarkable milestones.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe history of the United States is full of remarkable milestones.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) has a minor error in grammar, using the plural form \"are\" instead of the singular form \"is\" to agree with the singular noun \"history\". Output (b) is grammatically correct, using the singular form \"is\" to agree with the singular noun \"history\". Therefore, Output (b) has a better text quality.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide the same information, which is the revised statement. Since the instruction only asks for a revised statement, this criterion is not applicable.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, which is to revise the statement to make it grammatically correct. Therefore, this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) contains an error in grammar, while Output (b) is accurate and correct. Therefore, Output (b) has a higher accuracy.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to revise the statement, and neither output omits any part of the instruction. Therefore, both outputs are complete in following the instruction.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nThe most important aspect in this evaluation is the accuracy and text quality, as the instruction specifically asks for a grammatically correct statement. Output (b) excels in these aspects, while Output (a) has a minor error in grammar. Although both outputs follow the instruction, Output (b) is the better choice due to its higher accuracy and better text quality.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nSuggest an eco-friendly way to travel\n\n# Output (a):\nYou can try taking public transportations, renting a car or using ride-hailing services such as Uber or Lyft. They are more efficient than regular cars and produce fewer emissions.\n\n# Output (b):\nConsider taking public transportation or renting a car with fewer emissions when travelling. If you must take a plane, look for an airline with a lower carbon footprint.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and easy to understand, with a clear and concise message. Output (b) is also well-written, but the sentence structure is slightly more complex, making it slightly less fluent.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a specific and actionable suggestion, but it lacks additional information or examples. Output (b) provides more general advice and suggests considering multiple options, but it also lacks specific details.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clear, and both outputs respond directly to the instruction. Neither output requires inference or asks for clarification.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs provide accurate information, but Output (a) is more specific and provides concrete examples.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction, but Output (b) provides a more comprehensive response by considering multiple options and suggesting alternatives.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile both outputs are well-written and accurate, Output (a) is more specific and provides a clear, actionable suggestion. Output (b) is more general and lacks specific details. However, Output (b) provides a more comprehensive response by considering multiple options. Considering the importance of providing a clear and actionable suggestion, I weigh the importance of Output (a) slightly higher.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. The code is concise and easy to read. Output (b) is also well-structured, but the code is longer and more verbose.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more information about the date and the day of the week, as it uses the datetime module to get the day of the week. Output (b) only returns the day of the week as a string.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) is accurate, as it uses the datetime module to get the day of the week. Output (b) is also accurate, but it uses a more manual approach to determine the day of the week.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction to create a program that determines the day of the week for a given date. Output (b) also follows the instruction, but it uses a different approach.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) is better in terms of text quality and information richness, as it provides more concise and accurate information. Output (b) is better in terms of completeness of instruction following, as it uses a different approach to achieve the same result.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

This shows that the person is either too busy or too exhausted to shop, indicating that they may be busy with other activities or just might not have the energy to shop. This sentence also reveals the person's lack of interest in shopping, which could be due to financial or time constraints.\n\n# Output (b):\nThis sentence is an example of an excuse. It suggests that someone did not do something because they were too tired, when in fact there may be other reasons why they did not shop. It could be interpreted as someone trying to avoid responsibility or justify their actions.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and coherent, with a clear flow of ideas. The language is professional and free of errors. Output (b) is also well-written, but the tone is slightly more informal and the language is not as polished.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides additional information and examples to support the analysis of the sentence, making it more informative and helpful. Output (b) only provides a brief analysis of the sentence and does not offer any additional insights.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately analyze the sentence and provide correct information. However, Output (a) provides a more detailed and nuanced analysis of the sentence.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction is to analyze the sentence, and both outputs fulfill this instruction without any omission.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) is more informative and provides a more detailed analysis of the sentence, making it a better output overall. While Output (b) is still a good analysis, it is less detailed and does not provide as much additional information.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Going for a walk, either alone or with friends.\n2. Going to a park or other outdoor area to play a game or engage in some activity.\n3. Getting some fresh air or sunshine. \n4. Going to work outside of the house or office.\n5. Going to a store or other commercial establishment that is located outside. \n6. Leaving the house and coming back inside.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe instruction \"Go outside\" can have different meanings depending on the situation. For example, if a parent tells their child to go outside to play, it can mean leaving the house and going to a nearby park or play area. But if a doctor tells a patient to go outside, it can mean stepping outside of the hospital or clinic for some fresh air and relaxation. In both cases, the literal act of going outside is the same, but the intent behind the instructions can be drastically different.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is a list of scenarios, but it lacks coherence and logical flow. The sentences are short and disconnected, making it difficult to follow. Output (b) is a well-structured paragraph that provides a clear and logical explanation of the different meanings of the instruction \"Go outside\".\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a list of scenarios, but it does not provide any additional information or explanations. Output (b) provides a detailed explanation of the different meanings of the instruction, including examples and context.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nOutput (a) does not infer any user intentions, as it simply lists scenarios. Output (b) infers the user's intention by providing examples of different situations and explaining the context.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their descriptions, but Output (b) provides a more nuanced understanding of the instruction's meaning.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) does not follow the instruction's intent, as it does not provide a clear explanation of the different meanings of the instruction. Output (b) follows the instruction's intent by providing a detailed explanation of the different meanings.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (b) is better because it provides a clear and logical explanation of the different meanings of the instruction, infers the user's intention, and follows the instruction's intent. Output (a) lacks coherence, provides no additional information, and does not infer the user's intention.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

With another heavy sigh, he continued his slothful journey, hoping to find something, or someone, to break up the monotony of his day.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe lazy elephant strolled through the jungle, avoiding the other animals by wishing them away with his trumpeting.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) has a more fluent and well-structured narrative, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. The sentence structure is varied, and the vocabulary is rich and descriptive. Output (b) is brief and lacks coherence, with a sudden shift in tone and style.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed and engaging information about the lazy elephant's journey, including his emotions and motivations. Output (b) is sparse and lacks depth, simply stating the elephant's action without providing any context or explanation.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to generate a short story from a single sentence, and both outputs attempt to fulfill this task. However, Output (a) provides a more developed and engaging story, while Output (b) is brief and lacks narrative depth.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately describe the elephant's action, but Output (a) provides more accurate and detailed information about the elephant's emotions and motivations.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to generate a short story from a single sentence, but Output (a) provides a more complete and engaging story, while Output (b) is brief and lacks narrative depth.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it provides a more fluent, well-structured, and engaging narrative, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nReformat the sentence so it is a question: I was surprised by the outcome.\n\n# Output (a):\nWhat surprised you about the outcome?\n\n# Output (b):\nWhat was most surprising was the outcome.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors, making it easy to read and understand. Output (b) is also well-structured, but it uses a slightly more complex sentence structure, which may make it slightly harder to follow.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the instruction is asking for a simple rephrased question.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) accurately rephrase the sentence as a question. There is no room for error in this case.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) precisely follow the instruction, rephrasing the sentence as a question without adding or omitting any information.\n\nOverall, while Output (b) uses a slightly more complex sentence structure, Output (a) is still easy to read and understand. The accuracy and completeness of both outputs are identical.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGiven a list of numbers and the letter \"a\", sort the list in the following order: All the even numbers followed by \"a\" followed by all the odd numbers.\nList of numbers: 5, 2, 9, 12, 8, 6, a, 11\n\n# Output (a):\n5, 8, 12, 2, 6, 11, a, 9, 1\n\n# Output (b):\n2, 12, 8, 6, a, 5, 9, 11\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. Output (b) is also well-structured, but it seems to be missing a number (1) which is present in the original list. Therefore, Output (a) has a slight edge in terms of text quality.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide the same information, which is the sorted list of numbers. Since the instruction does not ask for additional information, this criterion is not applicable.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, so this criterion is not applicable.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) accurately sorts the list of numbers according to the instruction, while Output (b) is missing the number 1 and has the letter \"a\" in the wrong position. Therefore, Output (a) is more accurate.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction completely, including the correct placement of the letter \"a\". Output (b) is missing a number and has the letter \"a\" in the wrong position, which means it does not follow the instruction completely.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nBased on the evaluation, Output (a) excels in terms of text quality, accuracy, and completeness of instruction following. While Output (b) is also well-structured, it lacks accuracy and completeness. Therefore, Output (a) is better.\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.0917714536190033}, {"1": -1.0728830375228426e-06}, {".": -2.7894584491150454e-05}, {" Text":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Output (b) is a sentence that provides a clear explanation of the answer, but it contains a minor error in stating that 15 is the smallest positive integer number that is divisible by 5 (the correct answer is 5).\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides no additional information, while Output (b) provides some explanation, but it is not accurate.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) lacks coherence and structure, as it simply lists the plumbing fixtures without providing any explanation or connection between them. Output (b) is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear explanation of how the plumbing system works.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides very limited information, only listing the plumbing fixtures without any additional details. Output (b) provides more detailed information about the plumbing system, explaining how the waste and water supply lines connect to the main drain line and water heater.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe instruction asks for a plumbing diagram, which implies that the user wants a visual representation of the plumbing system. Output (a) does not provide a diagram, while Output (b) provides a clear and concise explanation of the plumbing system, which can be used to create a diagram.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) does not provide any information about the plumbing system, so it is difficult to evaluate its accuracy. Output (b) provides accurate information about the plumbing system, explaining how the waste and water supply lines connect to the main drain line and water heater.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction asks for a plumbing diagram for a two-story house, and Output (b) provides a clear explanation of the plumbing system, which can be used to create a diagram. Output (a) does not provide a diagram and only lists the plumbing fixtures.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (b) is better because it provides a clear and concise explanation of the plumbing system, which can be used to create a diagram. It also provides accurate information about the plumbing system, and follows the instruction by explaining how the waste and water supply lines connect to the main drain line and water heater. Output (a) lacks coherence and structure, provides limited information, and does not follow the instruction by not providing a diagram.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n":

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) provides three example sentences that use the word \"redundant\" to show its meaning and usage, which are well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. The sentences are also coherent and have a clear flow of ideas. Output (b) consists of only three short sentences that do not provide a clear explanation of the word \"redundant\" or its usage.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides three example sentences that demonstrate the usage of the word \"redundant\", which is a rich and detailed response. Output (b) only provides a few short sentences that do not provide any additional information about the word \"redundant\".\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, which is to provide example sentences that use the word \"redundant\". Output (a) meets this intention by providing three example sentences, while Output (b) does not.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth Output (a) and Output (b) are accurate in their usage of the word \"redundant\".\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction asks for three example sentences that use the word \"redundant\", and Output (a) provides exactly that. Output (b) does not follow the instruction as it only provides a few short sentences and does not provide the requested example sentences.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) is a better response because it provides a rich and detailed response that meets the user's intention and follows the instruction. The example sentences are well-structured and free of errors, and they demonstrate the usage of the word \"redundant\" in a clear and logical flow of ideas. Output (b) is a poor response because it does not provide a clear explanation of the word \"redundant\" or its usage, and it does not follow the instruction.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.",

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Where do you usually go?\n\n# Output (b):\nWhat do you like to do on the weekends, Tom?\n\nTom: I love to go hiking on the weekends. It's the perfect way to unwind and get some exercise.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is not well-structured and lacks coherence, as it seems to be a question rather than a response to the instruction. Output (b) is well-structured and coherent, providing a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs are short and lack additional information. However, Output (b) provides more relevant information by asking a question and encouraging Tom to share his experience, which could lead to a more detailed response.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, but Output (b) provides some relevant information by asking a question and attempting to infer Tom's intention.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate and correct.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction asks for a response about Tom's hobby, and both outputs provide a response. However, Output (b) is more complete in following the instruction as it asks a question and encourages Tom to share his experience, which is more relevant to the instruction.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile both outputs have some strengths and weaknesses, Output (b) is better overall. Output (b) is well-structured and coherent, provides more relevant information, and attempts to infer the user's intention. Although Output (a) is short and lacks coherence, it is still a response to the instruction.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

What kind of work do you do?\nPerson A: I'm a digital marketer.\nPerson B: That sounds interesting, what kind of projects have you worked on?\nPerson A: Oh, I've done a lot of different things. \nPerson B: That sounds really cool. \nPerson A: Well, if you're looking for something to do while you're here, why not check out this museum? \nPerson B: Sounds like a plan, I'm always up for discovering new places. \nPerson A: Me too!

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) has a fluent and well-structured conversation script, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. The dialogue is coherent and easy to follow. Output (b) is brief and lacks a clear structure, making it difficult to follow.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a rich and detailed conversation script, with a good balance of small talk and meaningful discussion. Output (b) is very brief and lacks any meaningful information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to write a script for a 10-second conversation between two characters. Output (a) meets this intention by providing a complete and detailed conversation script. Output (b) does not meet this intention, as it is too brief and does not provide a complete conversation.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in terms of grammar and spelling. However, Output (a) provides more accurate and realistic dialogue, while Output (b) is too brief and lacks any meaningful information.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction asks for a 10-second conversation script, and Output (a) meets this instruction by providing a complete and detailed conversation script. Output (b) does not meet this instruction, as it is too brief and does not provide a complete conversation.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is better because it meets the user's intention by providing a complete and detailed conversation script, has a good text quality, and is accurate. Output (b) is too brief and lacks any meaningful information, making it a less desirable output.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nCreate an original proverb that describes friendship.\n\n# Output (a):\nA friend in need is a friend indeed.\n\n# Output (b):\nIn the garden of life, true friends are the flowers that never wither.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is a simple and well-structured proverb with no grammatical or spelling errors. Output (b) is also well-structured, but the metaphor used is a bit more complex and may be harder to understand for some readers.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs are concise and provide a clear message about friendship. However, Output (a) is more direct and straightforward, while Output (b) uses a metaphor to convey the idea, which may make it more memorable and engaging.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the instruction, which is to create an original proverb that describes friendship. Both outputs meet this intention, but Output (a) is more literal and straightforward, while Output (b) is more creative and uses a metaphor.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate and provide a correct description of friendship.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction to create an original proverb that describes friendship, and neither output omits or adds any information that is not requested.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nBoth outputs have their strengths and weaknesses. Output (a) is more direct and straightforward, while Output (b) is more creative and uses a metaphor. However, considering the importance of creativity and originality in the instruction, I give more weight to Output (b) for its unique and engaging approach.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is a numerical list, which is clear and concise. Output (b) is a sentence that does not provide the actual result of dividing the list of numbers by 10, but rather describes the action. Output (a) has a better text quality as it directly provides the result.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides the actual result of dividing the list of numbers by 10, which is the expected output. Output (b) does not provide any additional information beyond describing the action. Output (a) has a higher information richness as it provides the actual result.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed by the query, which is to divide the list of numbers by 10. Both Output (a) and Output (b) infer the user's intention correctly. This criterion is not applicable in this case.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) provides the correct result of dividing the list of numbers by 10. Output (b) does not provide the actual result, but rather describes the action. Output (a) has higher accuracy as it provides the correct result.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction by providing the result of dividing the list of numbers by 10. Output (b) does not follow the instruction as it does not provide the actual result. Output (a) has higher completeness in following the instruction.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nThe most important criteria in this case are Text Quality, Information Richness, and Completeness of Instruction Following. Output (a) excels in these criteria, providing a clear and concise numerical list that directly answers the question. Output (b) fails to provide the actual result and instead describes the action.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nInfer the implied meaning of the following sentence: She is not what she used to be.\n\n# Output (a):\nShe is not as she once was.\n\n# Output (b):\nShe has changed substantially over time.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is a simple and straightforward response that accurately conveys the implied meaning of the sentence. The sentence structure is clear and easy to understand. Output (b) is also well-structured, but it provides a slightly more nuanced interpretation of the sentence. However, both outputs are free of spelling and grammatical errors, making them both fluent and coherent.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the instruction is asking for a simple inference rather than providing additional information.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nBoth outputs demonstrate a good understanding of the user's intention, as they both infer the implied meaning of the sentence. However, Output (b) provides a slightly more detailed and nuanced interpretation, which shows a better understanding of the user's intention.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately convey the implied meaning of the sentence. There is no discrepancy in the information provided, and both outputs are free of inaccuracies.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs precisely execute the instruction, providing a single sentence that infers the implied meaning of the sentence. Neither output omits or adds any information that is not requested.\n\nOverall, while both outputs are strong, Output (b) demonstrates a slightly better understanding of the user's intention and provides a more nuanced interpretation of the sentence.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nGive me an example of a situation involving the use of a priority queue.\n\n# Output (a):\nFor example, a total order of tasks can be established, with each task having a priority associated with it. Tasks with a higher priority can be given preference and processed before tasks with a lower priority. This ensures that the most important tasks are processed first.\n\n# Output (b):\nA priority queue can be used in a taxi dispatch system. When a customer requests a taxi, the system needs to determine which taxi to send to the customer to minimize the total journey time for all customers. The taxi with the shortest estimated total journey time can be given the highest priority and served first. The system can serve the taxi with the highest priority first until one is served or the queue is empty.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is a clear and concise example of a situation involving the use of a priority queue, but it lacks specific details and examples. Output (b) provides a more practical and real-world example of a taxi dispatch system, which is a good illustration of how a priority queue can be used in a specific context.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a general example of a situation involving a priority queue, but it does not provide any additional information or details. Output (b) provides a more detailed example of a specific system and explains how a priority queue can be used to minimize the total journey time for all customers.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to provide an example of a situation involving the use of a priority queue. Output (a) does not infer the user's intention, while Output (b) provides a specific example that meets the user's intention.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate in their description of a priority queue and its use in a specific context.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction asks for an example of a situation involving the use of a priority queue. Output (a) provides a general example, while Output (b) provides a more specific and detailed example that meets the instruction.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (b) is a better example of a situation involving the use of a priority queue because it provides a more practical and real-world example, is more detailed and informative, and meets the user's intention more accurately. While Output (a) is a clear and concise example, it lacks specific details and examples, making Output (b) a better choice.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n":

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

Its strong performance is quite impressive according to this article.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe tone of the article is mostly positive, with an emphasis on Seattle's strong performance in the first half. However, there is a slight tone of frustration in the latter half of the article, with the mention of the Seahawks' \"lapses\" in defense.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1.

I believe in Jesus Christ\n\n# Output (a):\nThe best way to defeat a demon is to use the power of God. Jesus Christ has the authority and power to defeat demons and to set the captive free. The Bible teaches us to pray to God for help in times of trouble, and to seek His will in our lives. God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful. But God is greater than any demon, and He has the power to defeat them. Trust in God and He will help you.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe best way to defeat depression can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their condition. However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, don't hesitate to seek help.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful.

Trust in God and He will help you.", "output_2": "The best way to defeat depression can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their condition. However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nComplete the following sentence: \"Yesterday it was raining, so I put on my ____.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nYesterday it was raining, so I put on my jacket to keep out the rain.\n\n# Output (b):\nYesterday it was raining, so I put on my raincoat.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

However, Output (a) is slightly more fluent and natural-sounding, making it easier to read and understand.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the instruction is asking for a simple sentence completion.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is also not applicable, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs are accurate and correct, providing a suitable response to the given instruction.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction precisely, providing a complete and accurate response to the sentence completion.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nWhile both outputs are good, Output (a) is slightly better due to its more fluent and natural-sounding text quality. This aspect is important in this case, as it makes the output more readable and understandable. The other criteria, such as information richness and user intention inference, are not applicable in this case, and accuracy and completeness of instruction following are met by both

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of spelling and grammatical errors. The sentence is clear and concise, making it easy to understand. Output (b) is also well-structured, but the sentence is a bit shorter and lacks a clear address format.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides a specific restaurant name and address, which is relevant to the instruction. Output (b) also provides a restaurant name and address, but it is the same address as the given location, which is not accurate.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThis criterion is not applicable in this case, as the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nOutput (a) provides an accurate restaurant name and address. Output (b) provides an inaccurate address, as it is the same as the given location.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nOutput (a) follows the instruction by providing a specific restaurant name and address. Output (b) does not follow the instruction, as it provides an inaccurate address.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nOutput (a) excels in terms of text quality, accuracy, and completeness of instruction following. Output (b) lacks accuracy and does not follow the instruction. While Output (b) has good text quality, it is not enough to outweigh its inaccuracies.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5.

It is a member of the Felidae family and is closely related to the jaguar. Despite its ferocious reputation, it is actually an extremely shy and elusive creature, typically avoiding contact with humans.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe Panther is a mostly solitary species of mammal found in Central and South America. It is distinguishable by its black-spotted coat and slender, sleek build.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. The language is fluent and free of spelling and grammatical errors. Output (b) is concise but lacks a clear structure and flow, making it less readable.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nOutput (a) provides more detailed information about the Panther, including its behavior and habitat. Output (b) only provides a brief description of the Panther's physical characteristics.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is to identify the Panther, and both outputs provide relevant information. However, Output (a) provides more context and details, making it a better response.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs provide accurate information about the Panther. However, Output (a) provides more accurate information about the Panther's behavior and habitat.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nThe instruction asks for how to identify the Panther, and both outputs provide relevant information. However, Output (a) provides more comprehensive information, making it a better response.\n\nOverall, Output (a) is a better response because it provides more detailed and accurate information about the Panther, is well-structured and coherent, and provides more comprehensive information.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant who analyzes and evaluates the quality of two candidate outputs for a given instruction task based on a list of criteria, and makes a final decision on which output is better.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Given an instruction and two responses, Output (a) and Output (b), each aiming to fulfill the task, your task is to carefully analyze and evaluate each output based on a list of criteria.\n\nHere are some general rules for the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more or less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are equally likely to be the better one.\n\nYou should first provide an explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking before claiming which output is better.\n\nHere are some criteria to consider:\n1. Text Quality: The response should be fluent, well-structured, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. It should also be coherent, with a clear and logical flow of ideas.\n2. Information Richness: The response is encouraged to provide rich, detailed and professional information, e.g. by providing examples, explanations, citations, and additional information. This criterion is not applicable if the user asks for a short or direct answer without additional information.\n3. User Intention Inference: If the user's intention is not clearly expressed by the query, the response should provide some relevant information, do some reasonable inference and ask more information for clarification. This criterion is not applicable if the user's intention is clearly expressed by the query.\n4. Accuracy: All contents provided or mentioned in the response should be accurate and correct.\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following: For all key instructions (e.g., answer multiple questions or perform multiple tasks) and explicit constraints (e.g. word count, response length limit, word usage, output format, etc.) provided by the user, the response should be complete in following all of them without any omission.\n\nConsider how well each output meets the list of criteria and provide a comparative analysis. \n\nAfter your analysis, make a final decision on which output is better overall. Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, weighing the importance of each aspect, and make a final decision. Be mindful of the importance of each aspect in the context of the given instruction task, as some aspects may significantly influence the output's quality and relevance to the instruction, while others might be less critical.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\n[Your analysis]\n2. Information Richness:\n[Your analysis]\n3. User Intention Inference:\n[Your analysis]\n4. Accuracy:\n[Your analysis]\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\n[Your analysis]\n\n[Your overall evaluation and explanation, followed by the final decision]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Instruction\nRewrite the given sentence to make it more expressive and keep its meaning unchanged: She was caught in the heavy rain.\n\n# Output (a):\nShe found herself drenched in the pouring rain.\n\n# Output (b):\nShe was soaked in a sudden downpour as she made her way home.\n\n# Decision (Give an explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "\"\"\"\n1. Text Quality:\nOutput (a) is well-structured and free of errors, making it easy to read and understand. Output (b) is also well-written, but the sentence structure is slightly more complex, which may make it slightly harder to follow.\n\n2. Information Richness:\nBoth outputs provide the same level of information, simply rephrasing the original sentence to make it more expressive. Neither output provides additional information or examples, as the instruction does not require it.\n\n3. User Intention Inference:\nThe user's intention is clearly expressed in the instruction, which is to rewrite the sentence to make it more expressive while keeping its meaning unchanged. Neither output requires inference or asks for clarification.\n\n4. Accuracy:\nBoth outputs accurately convey the same meaning as the original sentence, with no errors or inaccuracies.\n\n5. Completeness of Instruction Following:\nBoth outputs follow the instruction by rewriting the sentence to make it more expressive and keeping its meaning unchanged, without omitting any key instructions or explicit constraints.\n\nOverall evaluation and explanation:\nBoth outputs meet the criteria well, but Output (b) stands out for its more vivid and descriptive language, which makes the sentence more engaging and expressive. While Output (a) is clear and concise, Output (b) adds more depth and emotion to the sentence. Therefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"\"\"\"\n": -0.04507263004779816}, {"1": -9.536738616588991e-07}, {".": -2.1576648578047752e-05}, {" Text": -3.576278118089249e-07}, {" Quality":
