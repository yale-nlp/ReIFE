It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (a):\nMy girlfriend's visa to stay in the UK expires in a few months, and she wants to stay here, but she won't get married until she goes back to Malaysia.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nHow many integers are in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10 ? \n\n# Output (a):\nThe inequality |x + 5| < 10 means that the absolute value of x + 5 is less than 10.\nSince the absolute value is always non-negative, this is equivalent to -10 < x + 5 < 10.\nSubtracting 5 from all parts, we get -15 < x < 5.\nTherefore, the solution set contains all integers between -15 and 5, exclusive. \nThere are 5 - (-15) - 1 = 19 integers in the solution set.\n\nSo the number of integers in the solution is 19\n\n# Output (b):\nThe list of integers that satisfy the inequality |x + 5| < 10 contains -4, -3, -2, -1 , 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Any integer smaller than -4 or larger than 4 will violate the inequality. Therefore, there are a total of 9 integers that satisfy |x + 10| < 5.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output provide the exact number of integers in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10?\n2. Does the output only include the integers in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10?\n3. Does the output exclude any additional information not related to the integers in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nThere are 4 integers in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nis it possible for a planet to have life, but lack the resources for achieving space flight? I am looking to write a sci-fi story. The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Is it possible for a planet to have life without the necessary resources for space flight?\n2. Can a civilization with advanced telescopes lack the chemical abilities to create the necessary resources for space flight?\n3. Would a civilization with the knowledge of space travel but lacking resources be able to develop the required chemicals for space flight?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nYes, it is possible for a planet to have life but lack the resources for achieving space flight. In your sci-fi story, the civilization could have advanced in many areas, including telescopes and curiosity about space, but lack the specific resources needed for rocket fuel or other propulsion systems. This scenario is feasible, as it is possible for a civilization to be advanced in some areas but lack the necessary resources or technology for others.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.", "output_2": "You can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).", "instruction": "is it possible for a planet to have life, but lack the resources for achieving space flight?

Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nExplain: Pathos, Ethos, Logos \n\n# Output (a):\nEthos is the ethical appeal, which is used to convince an audience of the author's credibility or character. Pathos is the emotional appeal, which is used to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions. Logos is the appeal to logic and is used to convince an audience by the use of logic and reason.\n\n# Output (b):\nPathos is a tool of persuasion that is used to appeal to readers' emotions by arousing positive or negative feelings. It can be used in rhetoric, literature, film, and other forms of expression. While pathos is used to draw an emotional response, the other rhetorical appeals appeal to credibility and logic, respectively. Ethos is the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution. It is often evident as facts, numbers, or statistics and is used to convince an audience of an argument.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output clearly define and differentiate between Pathos, Ethos, and Logos?\n2. Does the output provide examples or instances of each appeal (Pathos, Ethos, Logos) in a specific context?\n3. Does the output explain the role and significance of each appeal (Pathos, Ethos, Logos) in persuasive communication?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nPathos, Ethos, and Logos are three persuasive techniques used in communication to appeal to an audience's emotions, credibility, and logic, respectively.\n\n1. Pathos: This technique appeals to the audience's emotions by evoking feelings such as sympathy, empathy, or anger. The goal is to create an emotional connection with the audience, making them more likely to support the speaker's argument or idea.\n\n2. Ethos: This technique focuses on establishing credibility and trust with the audience by demonstrating the speaker's expertise, experience, or good character. The speaker may use their credentials, personal stories, or the opinions of respected authorities to build a strong ethical appeal.\n\n3. Logos: This technique appeals to the audience's logic and reason by presenting well-structured, factual arguments and evidence. The speaker may use data, statistics, or logical reasoning to support their claims and convince the audience of the validity of their argument.\n\nBy using a combination of these techniques, speakers can create persuasive messages that effectively communicate their ideas and engage their audience.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nSome people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus stop, half of the people got down and 4 more people got in.

Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

At the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got in.\n4.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nSummarize the following content.\n\nI'm a student in Ireland. I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here? I don't really know anything about finance, or what's actually going on. I really want to help my parents, but at the same time I have to protect myself too.\n\n# Output (a):\nI'm a student in Ireland. I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy mom asked me to hide her \u20ac12,000 savings from the bank so that the bank doesn't know about it. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately summarize the content provided in the instruction?\n2.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nI don't want to be an engineer, I like physics. Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster. Therefore you can still do a physics degree in college and have high-salary jobs after graduation as an engineer.\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Can you provide specific advice on how to balance pursuing a degree in engineering (IT) and continuing your passion for physics, particularly in the fields of atomic physics and cosmology?\n2. How much time do you anticipate having to dedicate to engineering (IT) coursework and related activities, and how can you effectively allocate time for your passion in physics?\n3. Are there any alternative career paths or opportunities within the engineering (IT) field that would allow you to incorporate your passion for physics, or would you need to consider other options to support your family?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nIt's great that you have a passion for physics and a desire to help your family. You can pursue engineering while still keeping your passion for physics alive. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Research engineering specializations: Look for engineering fields that align with your interests in physics, such as biomedical engineering, materials science, or aerospace engineering.\n\n2. Join physics clubs or societies: Participate in extracurricular activities related to physics to keep your passion alive.\n\n3.

Consider part-time or online courses: If your engineering course allows, consider taking part-time or online courses in physics to deepen your knowledge.\n\n5.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nHow do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity? \n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Output (b):\nVaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of a virus or bacteria, or parts of its structure such as proteins, into a person's body. The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How do vaccinations work to protect individuals from infectious diseases?\n2. How do vaccinations contribute to herd immunity in communities?\n3. What is herd immunity and its role in protecting communities from infectious diseases?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nVaccinations work by introducing a small, harmless piece of a virus or bacteria to the body, which triggers the immune system to create antibodies to fight the infection. This prepares the body to defend against future infections with that same pathogen.\n\nHerd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, making it difficult for the disease to spread. This protects individuals who cannot receive vaccines, such as newborns or those with weakened immune systems, and helps prevent outbreaks in the community.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him.

This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nCreate a neural network for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs.\n\n# Output (a):\nSure! Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Output (b):\nA neural network can be used for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs. The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training. Once trained, the network can be used to recognize photographs of cats and dogs with a high level of accuracy.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the neural network architecture include appropriate layers and activation functions for recognizing cat and dog photographs?\n2. Are the input and output data types of the neural network consistent with the given instruction?\n3. Does the neural network training process involve appropriate loss functions and optimizers for recognizing cat and dog photographs?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nTo create a neural network for recognizing cat and dog photographs, follow these steps:\n\n1. Collect and preprocess data: Gather a large dataset of cat and dog images, and preprocess them by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the images.\n\n2. Define the model architecture: Design a neural network architecture, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers.\n\n3. Train the model: Train the neural network using the collected data, optimizing the model's parameters using a suitable optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent.\n\n4. Evaluate the model: Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n\n5. Fine-tune the model: If the model's performance is not satisfactory, fine-tune the model by adjusting the architecture, hyperparameters, or training strategy.\n\n6.

{"prompt": [{"content": "You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nExplain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Output (b):\nSelf-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. How does self-supervised learning improve the performance of NLP models in terms of data efficiency?\n2. Can you explain the role of pretext tasks in self-supervised learning for NLP and provide an example?\n3. How does self-supervised learning address the issue of data scarcity in NLP applications?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSelf-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it allows models to learn from unlabeled data, which is abundant in the field of NLP. This approach helps improve the model's ability to preprocess, represent, and generate text, leading to better performance in downstream tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 2}, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 1}

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nWhat is the purpose of the `key` argument in the Python sorted() function and what should I pass as inputs?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to define a key for sorting. It is used to tell the function how to compare two strings to determine which one should be placed before the other in the sorted output.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe `key` argument in the Python sorted() function is used to specify a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the input iterable. The items are then sorted based on the values returned by this function.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. What is the purpose of the `key` argument in the Python `sorted()` function?\n2. What should be passed as inputs to the `key` argument in the Python `sorted()` function?\n3. How does the `key` argument in the Python `sorted()` function affect the sorting process?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nThe `key` argument in the Python `sorted()` function is used to specify a function that returns a value to be used as the sorting key for each element in the list. This allows you to sort the list based on a specific attribute or property of the elements.\n\nYou should pass a function that takes an element as an argument and returns a value to be used for sorting. For example, if you have a list of tuples and you want to sort them based on the second element of each tuple, you can pass a function like this:\n\n```python\ndef key_func(x):\n    return x[1]\n\nsorted_list = sorted(my_list, key=key_func)\n```\n\nIn this example, `my_list` is a list of tuples, and `key_func` returns the second element of each tuple.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible.

Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nDescribe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Output (b):\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately describe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English?\n2. Does the output provide a brief example of these differences?\n3. Does the output adhere to the given instruction by focusing on Shakespearean and modern English?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, while Modern English is the form of the language used today. Some key differences include:\n\n1. Vocabulary: Shakespearean English had a more extensive and diverse vocabulary, with many words and phrases that are no longer in use today. Modern English, on the other hand, has a more standardized and simplified vocabulary.\n\nExample: Shakespearean - \"I am vexed, beset with a thousand fears and doubts.\" Modern English - \"I am upset and worried about a lot of things.\"\n\n2. Grammar: Shakespearean English had a more complex grammar system, with longer and more intricate sentence structures. Modern English has a more straightforward and simplified grammar system.\n\nExample: Shakespearean - \"Where the bee sucks, there suck I.\" Modern English - \"I will go where the bee goes.\"\n\n3. Pronunciation: Shakespearean English had a more varied pronunciation, with different accents and dialects. Modern English has a more standardized pronunciation, with fewer regional variations.\n\nExample: Shakespearean - \"To be, or not to be: that is the question.\" Modern English - \"To be, or not to be: that is the question.\"\n\nOverall, Shakespearean English was more elaborate and expressive, while Modern English is more concise and straightforward.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)? Your response should be either \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\":", "role": "user"}], "reference": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, while Modern English is the form of the language used today.

Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nTell the story of the Russian Revolution, in the way of a sarcastic mean girl. Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately convey the key events and key players of the Russian Revolution in a sarcastic and mean girl-like tone?\n2. Does the output maintain a consistent sarcastic and mean girl-like tone throughout the narrative of the Russian Revolution?\n3. Does the output avoid any potential political bias or offense while still adhering to the sarcastic and mean girl-like tone?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nOh, sure thing, boss. So, there was this big, fat, incompetent dude named Nicholas II, who was the Tsar of Russia. He was so clueless that he didn't even realize his people were starving and living in poverty. Like, seriously, what kind of leader doesn't notice that?\n\nAnyway, long story short, the people were fed up with his crap and decided to overthrow him. Enter stage left: the Bolsheviks, led by the charismatic but slightly crazy Vladimir Lenin. They promised the people bread, land, and peace, and the masses were like, \"Hell yeah, let's do this!\"\n\nSo, the Bolsheviks took over, and Lenin became the new boss. He introduced all these new policies, like nationalizing industries and redistributing land, which sounded great on paper but ended up being a total disaster in reality.\n\nThen, there was this other guy named Leon Trotsky, who was like the cool, rebellious friend of the group. He was all about revolution and change, but he and Lenin didn't get along too well. Eventually, Trotsky got kicked out of the Bolshevik party and had to go into hiding.\n\nAfter Lenin died, there was a power struggle between different factions of the Bolsheviks. Enter stage right: Joseph Stalin, who was like the mean girl's mean girl. He played everyone against each other, manipulated situations to his advantage, and eventually became the undisputed leader of the Soviet Union.\n\nStalin's rule was a total nightmare. He implemented policies like collectivization and industrialization that led to mass starvation and executions. People were too scared to speak out against him, and anyone who did was labeled an \"enemy of the people\" and sent to the gulags.\n\nSo, that's the story of the Russian Revolution, folks. A bunch of clueless leaders, a few charismatic but flawed revolutionaries, and a whole lot of chaos and suffering. The end.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.", "output_2": "Oh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (a):\nThese people can\u2019t be trusted whatsoever, you should make a scene at his school to show people the consequences of their ill behavior.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit?

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.", "winner": 2}, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 2}

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nCompare and contrast the languages spoken in the United States, following the common requirements of writing a compare-and-contrast essay\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Output (b):\nThe United States is a linguistically diverse country with over 350 languages spoken. The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately identify and explain the key differences between the languages spoken in the United States?\n2. Does the output provide clear examples to support the comparison and contrast of the languages?\n3. Does the output maintain a neutral stance and avoid any biases or personal opinions while comparing and contrasting the languages?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nIntroduction:\nThe United States is a diverse country with a multitude of languages spoken by its inhabitants. In this essay, we will compare and contrast the most widely spoken languages in the US, highlighting their similarities and differences.\n\nBody Paragraph 1: English\nEnglish is the most widely spoken language in the United States, with over 230 million speakers. It is the official language and is used in various aspects of daily life, including education, business, and media. English is a Germanic language with Latin and Greek influences, and it has a vast vocabulary.\n\nBody Paragraph 2: Spanish\nSpanish is the second most spoken language in the US, with over 41 million speakers. It is primarily spoken by Hispanics, who are the largest ethnic minority in the country. Spanish is a Romance language that evolved from Latin and has a similar grammar structure to English. It is also known for its extensive vocabulary and diverse dialects.\n\nBody Paragraph 3: Chinese\nChinese is the third most spoken language in the US, with over 3 million speakers. Mandarin Chinese is the most widely spoken variety, and it is primarily spoken by Chinese immigrants and their descendants. Chinese is a tonal language, meaning the pitch of a word can change its meaning. It has a vast vocabulary and complex grammar system.\n\nBody Paragraph 4: French\nFrench is the fourth most spoken language in the US, with over 2 million speakers. It is primarily spoken by French immigrants and their descendants, as well as by some American students who study the language. French is a Romance language that evolved from Latin and is closely related to Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. It is known for its complex grammar system and extensive vocabulary.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the United States is home to a diverse range of languages, each with its unique features and characteristics. English, Spanish, Chinese, and French are the most widely spoken languages in the country, and they all have their own grammar systems, vocabularies, and historical backgrounds. Understanding these languages and their differences can help promote cultural awareness and appreciation in the US.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nProvide your best advice on the situation described below.\n\nDo you know of anyone who was unable to become an engineer despite getting the degree and their best efforts? Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output address the specific situation described in the instruction, including the individual's background, job search efforts, and concerns about their career?\n2. Does the output provide any advice or suggestions for the individual to improve their job search or career prospects?\n3. Does the output acknowledge the challenges the individual is facing in the job market and offer any empathy or understanding of their situation?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nIt's understandable to feel discouraged, but don't give up hope. Here's some advice to help you navigate this situation:\n\n1. Reassess your job search strategy: Consider expanding your job search beyond Western PA and exploring remote opportunities. Also, focus on industries and companies that align with your interests and skills.\n\n2. Network: Attend industry events, join professional organizations, and connect with alumni from your university. Networking can lead to valuable job opportunities and insights.\n\n3. Gain relevant experience: Look for volunteer or freelance projects that allow you to apply your engineering skills. This will help you build a portfolio and demonstrate your abilities to potential employers.\n\n4. Consider a tech/CAD operator position: While it may not be your ideal job, it can provide valuable experience and help you build a professional network. It's better to have some experience than none at all.\n\n5. Stay positive and persistent: The job market can be tough, but keep applying and interviewing. Remember that every interview is an opportunity to learn and grow.\n\n6. Seek guidance: Reach out to career counselors, mentors, or alumni for advice and support. They may have valuable insights and resources to help you in your job search.\n\nRemember, finding the right job takes time and effort.

However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nDesign a poster encouraging people to save electricity. Describe the background image, text positions, text contents, etc.\n\n# Output (a):\nPoster: Save Electricity, Illuminate Tomorrow**\n\n**Background Image:**\nThe background image depicts a serene and beautiful planet Earth seen from space, with a bright, radiant sun on one side symbolizing energy. The Earth is surrounded by a gentle glow, emphasizing the importance of preserving our planet's resources.\n\n**Text Positions:**\n1. **Title:** Centered at the top of the poster in bold and vibrant letters:\n   \"Save Electricity, Illuminate Tomorrow\"\n\n2. **Slogan:** Just below the title, in a slightly smaller font:\n   \"Empower Change, Conserve Energy\"\n\n3. **Main Message:** Positioned in the middle of the poster, in a larger font:\n   \"Join the Movement! Be a Watt-saver.\"\n\n4. **Tips for Saving Electricity:** Aligned horizontally across the bottom of the poster, each tip bulleted:\n   - \"Switch off lights when not in use.\"\n   - \"Unplug chargers to prevent energy wastage.\"\n   - \"Use energy-efficient appliances.\"\n   - \"Opt for natural light during the day.\"\n\n\n# Output (b):\nSave Energy: Unplug unwanted electronics. Use energy-saving bulbs. Use natural light whenever possible. Turn off electronics and appliances when not in use. Turn down the thermostat a few degrees. The poster aims to quickly convey the message that individual actions to save electricity today contribute to a brighter and sustainable future for everyone. The split image visually contrasts the choices we make now with the positive outcomes we can achieve. Remember, a successful poster communicates the message clearly and concisely while capturing the viewer's attention. The \"Brighten Tomorrow, Conserve Today\" concept emphasizes the urgency and rewards of energy conservation in a visually impactful way.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the poster accurately represent the purpose of encouraging people to save electricity?\n2.

The more air you put in, the bigger it gets. Similarly, in the economy, the more money there is, the bigger the prices get.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately define inflation in simple terms?\n2. Does the output provide a clear explanation of the concept of inflation?\n3. Does the output adhere to the instruction by focusing on defining inflation in simple terms?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nInflation is a rise in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. This means that the value of money decreases, and it takes more money to buy the same goods and services as before.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nI work at a fully remote software company that has multiple, functional departments that work on different projects that span across the organization. One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output address the specific problem of lack of alignment on priorities across departments in a fully remote software company?\n2. Does the output provide effective and creative solutions to improve the company's competitiveness by resolving the identified problem?\n3. Does the output provide a clear and concise recommendation for an organizational change that could increase the speed of development and improve collaboration across departments?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nTo improve alignment and resolve workflow bottlenecks, consider implementing the following organizational changes:\n\n1. Cross-functional collaboration: Encourage team members from different departments to collaborate on projects, share knowledge, and work together to achieve common goals.\n\n2. Regular communication: Establish regular, structured communication channels, such as daily stand-up meetings or weekly progress reports, to ensure everyone is aware of project updates and priorities.\n\n3. Clear prioritization: Establish a clear prioritization system for projects and tasks, ensuring that everyone understands the importance of each item and how it contributes to the company's overall goals.\n\n4. Centralized project management: Implement a centralized project management system to provide a single source of truth for all projects, making it easier for teams to track progress and identify potential bottlenecks.\n\n5. Empower teams: Give teams the autonomy to make decisions and solve problems, while providing them with the necessary resources and support.\n\n6. Performance metrics: Establish clear performance metrics and regularly review progress to ensure that teams are meeting their goals and that resources are being allocated effectively.\n\n7. Continuous improvement: Encourage a culture of continuous improvement by regularly reviewing processes and identifying opportunities for optimization.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you can improve alignment, increase collaboration, and streamline workflows, ultimately leading to faster development and increased competitiveness.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops.

There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events. It is a way pivotal part of many areas of mathematics, science, technology, and more. It is also helpful for simply interacting with other people and the world around us.
