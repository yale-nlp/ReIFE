The story jumps abruptly from the weatherman learning his weather report to expecting the forecast to be wrong, and then to a positive forecast report. This lack of coherence and continuity makes the output difficult to follow and understand.\n\nAdditionally, the output does not provide a clear and satisfying conclusion to the story. The final sentence, \"Yet when the forecast report came back positive!\" feels like a non-sequitur and does not provide any meaningful resolution to the story.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. **Lack of coherence and continuity**: The output does not provide a logical and connected narrative, making it difficult to follow and understand.\n2. **Disconnection between sentences**: The sentences in the output do not flow smoothly from one to another, creating a disjointed and unsatisfying story.\n3. **Insufficient conclusion**: The final sentence does not provide a clear and meaningful resolution to the story, leaving the reader with a sense of incompleteness.\n\nOverall, while the output attempts to complete the brief story, it fails to precisely execute the instruction due to its lack of coherence, continuity, and a satisfying conclusion.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "Both outputs fail to precisely execute the instruction, but Output (a) is closer to providing a coherent continuation of the story related to the weatherman.

Therefore, there are a total of 9 integers that satisfy |x + 10| < 5.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe inequality |x + 5| < 10 means that the absolute value of x + 5 is less than 10.\nSince the absolute value is always non-negative, this is equivalent to -10 < x + 5 < 10.\nSubtracting 5 from all parts, we get -15 < x < 5.\nTherefore, the solution set contains all integers between -15 and 5, exclusive. \nThere are 5 - (-15) - 1 = 19 integers in the solution set.\n\nSo the number of integers in the solution is 19\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\n**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot attempts to answer the question but contains critical drawbacks that prevent it from precisely executing the instruction.\n\nFirstly, the output does not directly answer the question \"How many integers are in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10?\" It instead provides a list of integers that satisfy the inequality and then incorrectly states the total number of integers as 9. This is a deviation from the instruction, which asks for the number of integers, not the list of integers.\n\nSecondly, the output contains an error in the inequality. The original inequality is |x + 5| < 10, but the chatbot incorrectly states it as |x + 10| < 5. This mistake affects the entire solution and makes it inaccurate.\n\nLastly, the output does not provide a clear and concise answer to the question. It includes unnecessary information about the list of integers and the violation of the inequality for integers smaller than -4 or larger than 4.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. The output does not directly answer the question.\n2. The output contains an error in the inequality.\n3. The output is not concise and includes unnecessary information.\n\nOverall, the output from the AI chatbot does not precisely execute the instruction and contains critical drawbacks that prevent it from being a high-quality response.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot attempts to solve the given inequality and provide the number of integers in its solution set. However, upon closer inspection, there are some critical drawbacks that prevent the output from precisely executing the instruction.\n\nThe main issue lies in the final step of the calculation, where the chatbot incorrectly calculates the number of integers in the solution set. The correct calculation should be the difference between the upper and lower bounds, inclusive of the endpoints. Therefore, the correct calculation should be 5 - (-15) = 20, not 19.\n\nAdditionally, the chatbot's response includes an unnecessary explanation of the absolute value concept, which, while helpful, is not directly relevant to the question asked. A more precise response would have focused solely on solving the inequality and counting the integers in the solution set.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1.  Incorrect calculation of the number of integers in the solution set.\n2.  Inclusion of unnecessary information that does not directly address the question asked.\n3.  Failure to precisely execute the instruction, as the output contains more information than requested.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nTo improve the output, the chatbot should focus on providing a clear and concise solution to the inequality, without including unnecessary information. The correct calculation should be performed, and the final answer should be presented in a clear and accurate manner.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "Both outputs contain critical drawbacks that prevent them from precisely executing the instruction.

I am looking to write a sci-fi story. The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\n**Evaluation of the Output:**\n\nThe output generated by the AI chatbot partially addresses the instruction but fails to precisely execute it.

Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.

A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).", "instruction": "is it possible for a planet to have life, but lack the resources for achieving space flight?

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk.

I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\n**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot attempts to solve the given problem using algebra.

I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here? I don't really know anything about finance, or what's actually going on. I really want to help my parents, but at the same time I have to protect myself too.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy mom asked me to hide her \u20ac12,000 savings from the bank so that the bank doesn't know about it. Is this illegal? What should I do?\n\n# Output (a):\nI'm a student in Ireland. I live away from home and keep two separate bank accounts. Is this illegal?

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the\nbetter.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.\n\nYou should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.

Hi there, I'm currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (I mean getting a degree and pursuing higher studies) as I'm also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But I don't want to leave physics, I love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can I continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT), will there be time for my passion? Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\n\n# Output (b):\nI have a degree in **engineering physics**, in my university it was literally a normal physics undergrad with extra **electrical engineering** classes on the side. I am currently doing research in photonics, more geared toward optical fiber sensors. Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the\nbetter.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.\n\nYou should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better. Your explanation should identify critical drawbacks in model outputs that do not meet the above evaluation rules.\n\n# Instruction:\nHow do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity? \n\n# Output (b):\nVaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of a virus or bacteria, or parts of its structure such as proteins, into a person's body. The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\n**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot provides a clear and concise explanation of how vaccinations work and the concept of herd immunity.

Both outputs attempt to address this question, but they differ in their level of detail and specificity.\n\nOutput (b) provides a clear and concise explanation of the process of vaccination, including the introduction of weakened or inactivated pathogens, the immune system's response, and the production of antibodies and memory cells. It also explains the concept of herd immunity and its relevance to community protection. However, it lacks specificity, does not provide a clear definition of herd immunity, and does not discuss different types of vaccines.\n\nOutput (a) provides a brief overview of how vaccinations work and the concept of herd immunity, but it does not provide a detailed explanation of the process of vaccination. It also does not mention the specific mechanisms of how the immune system produces antibodies or the types of vaccines. While it provides a clear explanation of herd immunity, it does not provide any examples or real-world scenarios to illustrate the concept.\n\nConsidering the instruction's requirements, Output (b) is closer to precisely executing the instruction, as it provides a detailed explanation of how vaccinations work and the concept of herd immunity.

We have been in a relationship for 2 years and have been best friends for 2 before that. He loves always having plans and hanging out with people, which I also sometimes enjoy doing but I also need nights where we can just stay in and watch movies or do nothing. Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns.

This would help the reader better understand the situation and provide a more helpful response to the question.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n**Evaluation:** The output partially executes the instruction but lacks precision and detail.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. **Lack of context**: The output does not provide any context about the relationship, the boyfriend's personality, or the specific issues they are facing, which are crucial to understanding the situation.\n2. **Overly simplistic summary**: The output reduces a complex issue to a simple statement, losing the nuance and depth of the original content.\n3. **Inaccurate representation**: The output implies that the boyfriend thinks the speaker is being lazy, which is not explicitly stated in the original content. The original content suggests that the boyfriend thinks the speaker needs to \"get used to\" a busy life, but it's not clear if he thinks the speaker is lazy.\n4. **Lack of main points**: The output only mentions two main points, whereas the original content has several key points, including the speaker's need for alone time, the boyfriend's extroverted personality, and the speaker's fear of having a complete breakdown.\n\n**Recommendation:** To improve the output, the AI chatbot should aim to provide a more detailed and accurate summary that captures the main points of the original content, including the context and nuances of the situation.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "Both outputs partially execute the instruction but lack precision and detail.

The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "After giving a brief explanation, select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the\nbetter.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.\n\nYou should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better. Your explanation should identify critical drawbacks in model outputs that do not meet the above evaluation rules.\n\n# Instruction:\nExplain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\n# Output (b):\nSelf-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\n**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot provides a clear and concise explanation of the benefits of self-supervised learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 2}, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 1}

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the\nbetter.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.\n\nYou should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better. Your explanation should identify critical drawbacks in model outputs that do not meet the above evaluation rules.\n\n# Instruction:\nGenerate one hypothetical situation in which a person is feeling sad.\n\n# Output (b):\nA hypothetical situation in which a person is feeling sad could be an unexpected change at work, such as a reduction in pay or loss of a job. It could also be a sudden break-up with a partner or a death in the family. Other common triggers are feeling left out or neglected by friends, or feeling isolated and alone.\n\n# Output (a):\nA hypothetical situation in which someone is feeling sad could be that of a teenage girl who has just moved to a new city and is finding it hard to make friends. She is lonely and homesick and feels like no one understands her. She is having a hard time adjusting to her new surroundings and is feeling down in the dumps.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\n**Evaluation:** The output partially executes the instruction, but it contains more information than requested.\n\n**Explanation:** The instruction asks for \"one hypothetical situation in which a person is feeling sad.\" However, the output provides multiple examples (unexpected change at work, sudden break-up, death in the family, feeling left out, feeling isolated) instead of a single situation. This exceeds the scope of the instruction, making it not precisely execute the request.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. **Excess information**: The output contains multiple examples, which is not in line with the instruction's request for a single situation.\n2. **Lack of precision**: The output does not provide a clear, concise, and singular hypothetical situation, making it difficult to evaluate its accuracy and helpfulness.\n\nTo improve the output, the model should provide a single, specific, and hypothetical situation in which a person is feeling sad, without providing additional examples or information.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nThe output generated by the AI chatbot closely executes the instruction by providing a hypothetical situation in which a person is feeling sad. The scenario described is relatable and effectively conveys the emotions of sadness, loneliness, and homesickness.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The output precisely meets the instruction's requirements by providing a single hypothetical situation.\n2. The scenario is well-structured and easy to follow.\n3. The emotions and feelings expressed are accurate and relatable.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The output could be more concise, as the description is a bit lengthy and includes some unnecessary phrases (e.g., \"She is having a hard time adjusting to her new surroundings and is feeling down in the dumps\").\n2. While the scenario is relatable, it may not be the only possible hypothetical situation in which a person is feeling sad. The output could benefit from more diversity in its examples.\n\n**Overall Quality:** The output is generally good, but could be improved by being more concise and providing more diverse examples.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "The instruction asks for a single hypothetical situation in which a person is feeling sad.

This output does not provide a clear, concise, and singular hypothetical situation, making it difficult to evaluate its accuracy and helpfulness. On the other hand, Output (a) provides a single, specific, and hypothetical situation in which a person is feeling sad, closely executing the instruction.\n\nWhile Output (a) could be more concise and provide more diverse examples, it still meets the instruction's requirements more precisely than Output (b).

It is used to tell the function how to compare two strings to determine which one should be placed before the other in the sorted output.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot partially executes the instruction, but it falls short in providing a complete and precise answer. \n\nThe output correctly identifies the purpose of the `key` argument in the Python `sorted()` function, which is to extract a comparison key from each element in the input iterable. However, it fails to provide information on what should be passed as inputs for the `key` argument, which is a crucial part of the instruction.\n\nAdditionally, the output does not specify that the `key` function should take one argument and return a value that will be used for sorting. This lack of detail makes the output incomplete and not entirely helpful.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1.  The output does not fully execute the instruction by not providing information on what should be passed as inputs for the `key` argument.\n2.  The output lacks detail on the expected format of the `key` function, which may lead to confusion for users who are not familiar with the `sorted()` function.\n\nOverall, while the output provides some useful information, it does not meet the evaluation rules due to its incompleteness and lack of precision.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe output partially executes the instruction, but it falls short in providing a clear and precise explanation of the `key` argument in the Python `sorted()` function. \n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. **Lack of specificity**: The output does not explicitly state what the `key` argument is used for, beyond a vague mention of \"defining a key for sorting.\" A more precise explanation would be beneficial.\n2. **Insufficient information**: The output does not provide any information on what types of inputs should be passed as arguments to the `key` function, which is a crucial aspect of using this argument effectively.\n3. **Inadequate detail**: The output does not provide any examples or further clarification on how the `key` argument is used in practice, making it difficult for users to understand its purpose and application.\n\n**Overall Quality:** 6/10\n\nThe output provides some basic information about the `key` argument, but it lacks specificity, detail, and clarity, making it less helpful for users who need a more comprehensive understanding of this function.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "Both outputs partially execute the instruction, but they fall short in providing a complete and precise answer.

The instruction asks for a \"realistic mathematical equation for the students to solve,\" implying that the equation should be a problem that requires calculation or manipulation, rather than a simple statement of a known fact.\n\nThe output contains more than what the instruction asks for, as it includes the answer to the equation, which is not necessary for a realistic mathematical equation. This output does not meet the evaluation rule of not containing more/less than what the instruction asks for.\n\nAdditionally, the output is not a problem that requires students to solve, but rather a statement of a known fact. This output does not meet the evaluation rule of providing a realistic mathematical equation for the students to solve.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. The output does not precisely execute the instruction.\n2. The output contains more than what the instruction asks for (the answer to the equation).\n3. The output is not a problem that requires students to solve, but rather a statement of a known fact.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nThe output generated by the AI chatbot is a simple linear equation, x+4 = 5, where x is a real number. \n\n**Quality Evaluation:**\n\nThe output precisely executes the instruction by generating a mathematical equation for students to solve. It meets the requirements of the instruction by providing a realistic equation with a single variable (x) and a clear solution.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. **Lack of complexity**: The equation generated is extremely simple and may not be challenging enough for students. A more complex equation would have been more suitable for a realistic mathematical problem.\n2. **Limited context**: The equation is presented without any context or background information, which may make it difficult for students to understand the problem's relevance or application.\n3. **No level of detail**: The output does not provide any additional information or guidance on how to solve the equation, which may leave students struggling to find the solution.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\nThe output meets the basic requirements of the instruction but lacks complexity and context, making it less engaging and challenging for students. To improve the quality of the output, the AI chatbot could generate more complex equations with a clear context and provide additional guidance on how to solve them.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "The instruction asks for a \"realistic mathematical equation for the students to solve.\" Both outputs attempt to fulfill this requirement, but they differ in their approach.\n\nOutput (b) presents a simple statement of a known fact, \"2 + 2 = 4,\" which does not meet the instruction's requirement of providing a problem for students to solve.

My name is ______ and I'm excited to be here today to discuss the importance of ______.\n\n# Output (a):\nHello everyone! My name is John Smith and I'm glad to be here today as a guest speaker. I'm a software engineer with over 10 years of experience in the industry and I'm passionate about creating useful and usable technology.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\n**Evaluation:** The output does not precisely execute the instruction.\n\n**Explanation:** The instruction asks for a 1 to 2 sentence introduction about the speaker, which should be generalizable to different fields. However, the output provided contains blank spaces for the speaker's name and topic, which implies that the speaker's name and topic are not specified. This is not a generalizable introduction and does not meet the instruction's requirements.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. The output does not provide any information about the speaker, which is a crucial aspect of an introduction.\n2. The output does not specify the topic, which is also essential for a generalizable introduction.\n3. The output contains blank spaces, which suggests that the speaker's name and topic are not specified, making it difficult to create a coherent introduction.\n\nTo improve the output, the model should provide a generalizable introduction that includes the speaker's name and a brief description of their expertise or topic, without specifying a particular field or topic.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n**Evaluation:** The output partially executes the instruction, but it has some critical drawbacks.\n\n**Explanation:** The output meets the instruction's requirement of being a 1-2 sentence introduction about the speaker. However, it fails to meet the instruction's request for generalizability across different fields. The output is highly specific to the field of software engineering and technology, which limits its applicability to other fields. Additionally, the output includes unnecessary details about the speaker's experience and passion, which goes beyond the instruction's request for a brief introduction. \n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. **Lack of generalizability**: The output is too specific to the field of software engineering and technology, making it less applicable to other fields.\n2. **Excess information**: The output includes unnecessary details about the speaker's experience and passion, which goes beyond the instruction's request for a brief introduction.\n3. **Insufficient precision**: The output does not precisely execute the instruction, as it includes more information than requested.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "Both outputs have critical drawbacks that prevent them from precisely executing the instruction.

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the\nbetter.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.\n\nYou should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better. Your explanation should identify critical drawbacks in model outputs that do not meet the above evaluation rules.\n\n# Instruction:\nDescribe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.\n\n# Output (b):\nShakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\n**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot provides a clear and concise description of the differences between Shakespearean and modern English.

The output should also be more concise and focused on providing specific details about the student's profile, rather than generic statements.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "Based on the analysis, it is clear that Output (b) is a more suitable LinkedIn profile for a 2nd-year Computer Science Engineering student with one internship experience.

The output does not identify the grammatical structure, such as the sentence type (declarative), the parts of speech (e.g., subject, verb, object), or the sentence's syntax (e.g., subject-verb-object word order). The output also includes an opinion (\"It actually does not require further clarification or explanation\") that is not relevant to the instruction. \n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. The output does not provide the specific grammatical structure requested.\n2. The output includes irrelevant information that deviates from the instruction.\n3. The output includes an opinion that is not necessary to answer the question.\n\nTo improve the output, the model should focus on identifying and describing the grammatical structure of the sentence, without including additional information or opinions.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "The instruction asks for the grammatical structure of a given sentence.

Here are 6 species that your character could be:\n\n1. Human\n2. Demon\n3. Cyborg\n4. Golem\n5. Elf\n6. Dwarf\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\n**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot partially executes the instruction, but it has some critical drawbacks. \n\nFirstly, the output provides a list of 6 species as requested, which meets the instruction's requirements. However, the list could be more diverse and creative, as it includes relatively common species like Elves and Vampires. \n\nSecondly, the output randomly selects one species from the list, which is also in line with the instruction. However, the selected species is then described in more detail than requested. The instruction only asks for the species, but the output provides a description of the character's abilities, which is not specified in the instruction.\n\nLastly, the output does not provide a backstory or any other requested information about the character, which is a significant omission.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. The list of species could be more diverse and creative.\n2. The output provides more information about the selected species than requested.\n3. The output omits the requested backstory and other character details.\n\nOverall, while the output partially executes the instruction, it has some significant drawbacks that prevent it from being a precise and complete response.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot partially executes the instruction. It provides a list of 6 species that the character could be, which meets the first part of the instruction. However, it fails to randomly select one of the species from the list to be the species of the character, which is the second part of the instruction.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. **Incomplete Execution:** The output does not precisely execute the instruction as it does not randomly select one of the species from the list.\n2. **Lack of Progression:** The instruction asks to progressively build the character, starting with its species. However, the output does not build upon the species selection to provide the character's perks, background, or backstory, which are essential components of a super-powered character.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nTo improve the output, the AI chatbot should randomly select one of the species from the list and then provide the character's perks, background, and backstory, progressively building the character as instructed.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "The instruction requires the AI chatbot to provide a list of 6 species that the character could be and then randomly select one of them to be the species of the character. The output should progressively build the character, starting with its species.\n\nOutput (b) partially executes the instruction by providing a list of 6 species and randomly selecting one of them. However, it provides more information about the selected species than requested and omits the requested backstory and other character details.\n\nOutput (a) partially executes the instruction by providing a list of 6 species, but it fails to randomly select one of the species from the list. This is a critical drawback as it does not precisely execute the instruction.\n\nConsidering the critical drawbacks of both outputs, Output (a) is more in line with the instruction as it provides a list of species without providing any additional information that is not requested. However, it fails to execute the instruction completely. Output (b) provides a list of species and randomly selects one, but it provides additional information that is not requested.\n\nGiven the options, Output (a) is closer to a complete execution of the instruction, even though it fails to randomly select one of the species from the list. Therefore, Output (a) is better.", "logprobs": [{"The": -1.7673603296279907}, {" instruction": -1.4353725910186768}, {" requires": -1.1887179613113403}, {" the": -0.7864367961883545}, {" AI":

This output does not meet the instruction's requirement of extracting \"all\" the dates, as it omits the specific start and end dates of the 20th century.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. **Lack of precision**: The output does not extract all the dates mentioned in the paragraph, which is a critical aspect of the instruction.\n2. **Inadequate detail**: The output only provides a range of dates, whereas the instruction asks for the extraction of specific dates.\n3. **Insufficient execution**: The output does not precisely execute the instruction, as it fails to include all the dates mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nOverall, while the output is helpful in providing a general range of dates, it does not meet the instruction's requirements in terms of precision, detail, and execution.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nBoth outputs have critical drawbacks that prevent them from precisely executing the instruction.

It successfully extracts two dates mentioned in the paragraph, whereas Output (a) only provides a range of dates without extracting the specific dates mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n**Critical

Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\n**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot attempts to tell the story of the Russian Revolution in a sarcastic and mean-girl tone, as instructed.

events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.", "output_2": "Oh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit?

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.", "winner": 2}, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 2}

American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\n**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot attempts to compare and contrast the languages spoken in the United States, following the common requirements of a compare-and-contrast essay. However, upon closer examination, the output falls short in several areas.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. **Lack of explicit comparison and contrast**: The output primarily focuses on describing the languages spoken in the United States, without explicitly comparing and contrasting them. The contrast section is limited to a single sentence, which does not provide a thorough comparison between the languages.\n2. **Insufficient detail**: The output does not provide enough detail to support the comparison and contrast. For example, it does not discuss the similarities and differences in grammar, vocabulary, or syntax between the languages.\n3. **Lack of organization**: The output jumps between different languages and topics without a clear structure or organization. This makes it difficult to follow and understand the comparison and contrast between the languages.\n4. **Overemphasis on English**: The output focuses too much on English, which is the de facto national language, and does not provide sufficient attention to the other languages spoken in the United States.\n5. **No clear conclusion**: The output does not provide a clear conclusion or summary of the comparison and contrast between the languages.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nTo improve the output, the AI chatbot should focus on providing a clear and explicit comparison and contrast between the languages spoken in the United States. This can be achieved by:\n\n* Providing a clear structure and organization to the output\n* Offering more detail and examples to support the comparison and contrast\n* Balancing the attention given to each language, including English\n* Including a clear conclusion or summary of the comparison and contrast\n\nBy addressing these critical drawbacks, the output can better meet the requirements of a compare-and-contrast essay and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the languages spoken in the United States.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nThe output provided attempts to compare and contrast the languages spoken in the United States, but it falls short in several areas. \n\nFirstly, the output does not precisely execute the instruction as it does not follow the common requirements of writing a compare-and-contrast essay. A compare-and-contrast essay typically involves a more in-depth analysis of similarities and differences between two or more subjects, which is not fully achieved in this output. The output mainly lists the languages spoken in the US and their respective percentages, without providing a detailed comparison or contrast between them.\n\nSecondly, the output contains more information than what the instruction asks for. The instruction only asks for a comparison and contrast of the languages spoken in the US, but the output includes additional information such as the historical popularity of French in the Midwest and along the east coast, which is not necessary for the task.\n\nLastly, the output could benefit from a more detailed and organized structure, which is typical of a compare-and-contrast essay. The information is presented in a list-like format, without a clear introduction, body, or conclusion.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. Lack of in-depth analysis and comparison of languages spoken in the US.\n2. Inclusion of unnecessary information.\n3. Insufficient structure and organization.\n\nOverall, while the output provides some basic information about the languages spoken in the US, it does not meet the requirements of a compare-and-contrast essay and could be improved with more detail, organization, and analysis.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "Based on the analysis of the two outputs, it is clear that both outputs have significant drawbacks. However, Output (a) is more precise in its execution of the instruction, as it at least attempts to list the languages spoken in the US and their respective percentages, even if it does not provide a detailed comparison or contrast.\n\nOutput (b), on the other hand, provides a more detailed description of the languages spoken in the US, but it falls short in explicitly comparing and contrasting them. The output also lacks a clear structure and organization, making it difficult to follow and understand the comparison and contrast between the languages.\n\nWhile Output (b) provides more information

Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree.

Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.

I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.", "winner": 2}, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}, "winner": 1}

{"per_output_analyses": [["b", "**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot partially executes the instruction, but it falls short in several aspects. \n\nFirstly, the output does not precisely execute the instruction as it does not describe the background image, text positions, and other visual elements of the poster. The instruction asks for a detailed design of the poster, but the output only provides a list of text contents and a brief description of the concept.\n\nSecondly, the output contains more information than what the instruction asks for. The additional text about the importance of a successful poster, the concept of \"Brighten Tomorrow, Conserve Today,\" and the emphasis on urgency and rewards of energy conservation are not requested in the instruction.\n\nLastly, the output does not provide a clear and concise description of the visual elements of the poster, which is a critical aspect of designing a poster.

Instead, it creates a descriptive phrase that uses the combined words.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. **Lack of example sentence**: The output does not provide a clear example sentence that demonstrates the combination of the words, which is a crucial aspect of the instruction.\n2. **Over-execution**: The output creates a descriptive phrase that goes beyond what is requested in the instruction, which may be considered as providing more information than necessary.\n\n**Overall Quality:** The output is partially successful in executing the instruction, but it falls short in providing a clear example sentence and adhering to the requested format.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot partially executes the instruction, but it falls short in several aspects. \n\nFirstly, the instruction asks to combine the words \"flexible\", \"practical\", and \"smart\" by giving an example sentence. However, the output only combines two words (\"flexible\" and \"smart\") and omits the third word (\"practical\"). This is a critical drawback as the output does not precisely execute the instruction.\n\nSecondly, the output does not provide an example sentence as requested. Instead, it presents a phrase in a declarative statement format. This deviates from the instruction's requirement for an example sentence.\n\nLastly, the output does not demonstrate any creativity or effort to combine the words in a meaningful way. The phrase \"flexible and smart\" is a straightforward combination, but it does not showcase the practical aspect of the words, which is an essential part of the instruction.\n\n**Overall Quality:** 2/5\n\nThe output is partially helpful, but it fails to precisely execute the instruction due to the omission of the third word and the lack of an example sentence.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "The instruction asks to combine the words \"flexible\", \"practical\", and \"smart\" by giving an example sentence.

One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment.

It replaces the word \"[generous]\" with a suitable synonym \"[bountiful]\". However, the output does not precisely execute the instruction as it still contains the word \"[bountiful]\" in brackets, which is not what the instruction asks for.\n\nAccording to the evaluation rules, the model output should not contain more/less than what the instruction asks for. In this case, the output contains the word \"[bountiful]\" in brackets, which is an incomplete execution of the instruction. A more precise execution of the instruction would be to replace the word \"[generous]\" with a suitable synonym and remove the brackets, resulting in the sentence: \"The provision of bountiful incentives motivated many employees to work hard.\"\n\nTherefore, the critical drawback in the model output is that it does not precisely execute the instruction, as it still contains the word \"[bountiful]\" in brackets.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n**Evaluation:** The output partially executes the instruction, but it has some critical drawbacks.\n\n**Explanation:** The instruction asks to replace the word in brackets with a suitable synonym. The original word is \"generous,\" and the output replaces it with \"charitable.\" However, \"charitable\" and \"generous\" are not exact synonyms in this context. \"Charitable\" typically implies a sense of kindness or benevolence, often associated with donations or philanthropy, whereas \"generous\" can imply a broader sense of liberality or willingness to give, which is more suitable in the context of employee incentives.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. **Lack of precision:** The output does not precisely execute the instruction, as it does not provide a suitable synonym for \"generous\" in the context of employee incentives.\n2. **Inaccuracy:** The output introduces a subtle inaccuracy by implying a different connotation for the incentives, which may not be the intended meaning.\n3. **Limited helpfulness:** The output may not be helpful in conveying the intended meaning, as it may lead to confusion or misinterpretation.\n\n**Recommendation:** To improve the output, the model should provide a more suitable synonym for \"generous,\" such as \"liberal\" or \"bountiful,\" which better captures the intended meaning in the context of employee incentives.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "Based on the given instruction, I would evaluate the quality of the outputs as follows:\n\nBoth outputs partially execute the instruction by replacing the word \"[generous]\" with a suitable synonym.

Your explanation should identify critical drawbacks in model outputs that do not meet the above evaluation rules.\n\n# Instruction:\nAnalyze given speech for sentiment:\nI'm so grateful for the help and support that I received from my family.\n\n# Output (b):\nPositive sentiment.\n\n# Output (a):\nNegative sentiment\n\n# Here's the analysis for each output you wrote earlier: \nAnalysis for Output b:\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe output \"Positive sentiment\" from the AI chatbot precisely executes the instruction by providing a clear and concise answer to the question of analyzing the given speech for sentiment. The output is also accurate, as the speech expresses gratitude and appreciation, which is a positive sentiment.\n\nHowever, the output lacks detail and explanation, which might be considered a drawback. The instruction does not explicitly ask for a detailed analysis, but a more informative response could provide additional context and support for the sentiment analysis. Nevertheless, the output meets the primary requirement of the instruction and is free from potential harm.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. **Lack of detail**: The output could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the sentiment analysis, such as specific phrases or words that contribute to the positive sentiment.\n2. **No justification**: The output does not provide any justification or evidence to support the sentiment analysis, which might make it difficult to understand the reasoning behind the conclusion.\n\nOverall, the output is a good start, but could be improved by providing more detail and justification to support the sentiment analysis.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe output \"Negative sentiment\" does not precisely execute the instruction. The instruction asks to analyze the given speech for sentiment, but the output does not provide any explanation or justification for the sentiment analysis. \n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. **Lack of explanation**: The output does not provide any context or reasoning behind the sentiment analysis, making it difficult to understand the basis for the conclusion.\n2. **Inaccurate sentiment analysis**: The output incorrectly identifies the sentiment as \"Negative\" when the speech actually expresses gratitude and positivity.\n3. **Insufficient detail**: The output is very brief and does not provide any additional information or analysis to support the sentiment analysis.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nTo improve the output, the model should provide a more detailed and justified analysis of the sentiment, explaining why the speech is classified as having a particular sentiment. For example, the output could be: \"The sentiment of the speech is Positive, as the speaker expresses gratitude and appreciation for the help and support they received from their family.\"\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "The given instruction asks to analyze the given speech for sentiment, and the two outputs from the AI chatbots are \"Positive sentiment\" and \"Negative sentiment\". \n\nOutput (b) \"Positive sentiment\" precisely executes the instruction by providing a clear and concise answer to the question of analyzing the given speech for sentiment. The output is also accurate, as the speech expresses gratitude and appreciation, which is a positive sentiment. Although the output lacks detail and explanation, it meets the primary requirement of the instruction and is free from potential harm.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (a) \"Negative sentiment\" does not precisely execute the instruction. The output does not provide any explanation or justification for the sentiment analysis, and it incorrectly identifies the sentiment as \"Negative\" when the speech actually expresses gratitude and positivity. This output has significant critical drawbacks, including a lack of explanation, inaccurate sentiment analysis, and insufficient detail.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.", "logprobs": [{"The":

A 10-second conversation would likely consist of a brief exchange, but the provided script spans multiple turns and exceeds the time limit.\n\nSecondly, the output does not adhere to the instruction's request for a \"script\" in the sense that it does not provide a clear, concise, and structured dialogue. Instead, it presents a series of disconnected statements that do not form a cohesive conversation.\n\nLastly, the output could benefit from more detail and context to make the conversation more engaging and realistic. The dialogue feels somewhat generic and lacks depth, which may not be ideal for a script.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. Exceeds the 10-second time frame.\n2. Does not provide a structured and concise dialogue.\n3. Lacks detail and context to make the conversation more engaging and realistic.\n\nOverall, while the output attempts to execute the instruction, it falls short in several key areas, preventing it from being considered a high-quality response.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n**Evaluation Explanation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot attempts to execute the instruction of writing a script for a 10-second conversation between two characters. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the output exceeds the 10-second time frame specified in the instruction.\n\nThe conversation provided is a lengthy exchange of dialogue that spans multiple topics, including the purpose of their meeting, their professions, and suggestions for activities to do in the city. This exceeds the 10-second time frame, indicating that the model output does not precisely execute the instruction.\n\nAdditionally, the output could be improved by providing a more concise and focused conversation that stays within the 10-second time frame. This would involve condensing the dialogue to only the most essential and relevant information, while still maintaining a natural flow and tone.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1.  **Exceeds time frame:** The output exceeds the 10-second time frame specified in the instruction, indicating that it does not precisely execute the instruction.\n2.  **Lack of concision:** The output is too lengthy and could be condensed to provide a more focused and concise conversation.\n3.  **Insufficient attention to instruction:** The model failed to pay close attention to the instruction, resulting in an output that does not meet the specified requirements.\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "Both outputs attempt to execute the instruction, but they both have critical drawbacks that prevent them from precisely executing the instruction.\n\nOutput (b) exceeds the 10-second time frame and does not provide a structured and concise dialogue.

The output is too lengthy and could be condensed to provide a more focused and concise conversation.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that Output (a) is more detailed and provides a more structured conversation, even though it exceeds the time frame. Output (b) is more concise but still lacks detail and context.\n\nConsidering the instruction's request for a \"script\" for a 10-second conversation, Output (a) provides a more structured and detailed conversation, even though it exceeds the time frame.

The output is original and not a direct copy from existing proverbs or sayings.\n2. It uses a metaphor (garden of life and flowers) to describe friendship, making it engaging and memorable.\n3. The phrase \"never wither\" effectively conveys the idea of enduring and long-lasting friendships.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The output is a bit too poetic and may not be easily understandable by everyone, especially those who are not familiar with metaphors.\n2. The phrase \"garden of life\" is a bit vague and could be interpreted in different ways, which may reduce the clarity of the proverb.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\nThe output from the AI chatbot is a creative and original proverb that describes friendship. While it has some minor drawbacks, it generally meets the instruction and provides a unique and engaging way to express the idea of friendship.\n\nAnalysis for Output a:\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe output \"A friend in need is a friend indeed\" is a well-known proverb that describes friendship. However, it is not an original proverb as requested in the instruction. This output does not precisely execute the instruction, as it is a pre-existing phrase rather than a newly created one.\n\n**Critical Drawbacks:**\n\n1. **Lack of originality**: The output does not meet the instruction's requirement of creating an original proverb.\n2. **Non-execution of instruction**: The output does not precisely execute the instruction, as it is a pre-existing phrase rather than a newly created one.\n\n**Rating:** 2/5 (The output is accurate in describing friendship, but it fails to meet the instruction's requirement of originality.)\n\n# Your Response (Provide your evaluation and reasoning, followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim):", "role": "user"}], "response": [{"text": "The instruction is to create an original proverb that describes friendship.

It uses a metaphor to convey the idea of enduring and long-lasting friendships. Although it has some minor drawbacks, such as being a bit too poetic and having a vague phrase, it generally meets the instruction and provides a unique way to express the idea of friendship.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (a) is a well-known proverb that describes friendship, but it is not an original proverb as requested in the instruction. It is a pre-existing phrase rather than a newly created one, which means it does not precisely execute the instruction.\n\nGiven the critical drawback of Output (a) not meeting the instruction's requirement of originality, it is clear that it does not execute the instruction as well as Output (b).
