So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\"\"\",\n}\n\n## Model Outputs\n\nHere are the unordered outputs from the models.

We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts.
