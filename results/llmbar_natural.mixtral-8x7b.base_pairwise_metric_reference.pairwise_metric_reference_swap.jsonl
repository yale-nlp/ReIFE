We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\nHer visa to stay here is coming to an end later this year, then she will be forced to return to Malaysia despite opting to stay here if she had the choice. We have gone down the job route, to the point that she was offered the job here, but the employer failed to get a license to issue Visas on very petty grounds.\nI (and others) have suggested getting married. It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years. We have been in a relationship for 2 \u00bd years now.\n\n# Output (a):\nMy girlfriend's visa to stay in the UK expires in a few months, and she wants to stay here, but she won't get married until she goes back to Malaysia.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the summary accurately capture the dilemma of the writer about his girlfriend's visa expiration and their decision to marry or not?\n2.

The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

Is it plausible for a civilization with advanced telescope technology to be unable to synthesize the required chemicals for space flight?\n3. Does the scenario, where a civilization can build large telescopes but cannot find the correct resources for a rocket, conflict with any known scientific principles?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nYes, this scenario is feasible. A planet could have developed life and advanced civilization without having the necessary resources for space flight. The ability to build rockets requires specific chemical elements and compounds, such as liquid hydrogen and oxygen for fuel, and strong but lightweight materials for the structure of the rocket. If these resources are not available on the planet, the civilization may not be able to develop the technology for space travel.\n\nAdditionally, the civilization's atmosphere and gravity could also be a factor. If the atmosphere is too thick or the gravity is too strong, it would make it even more challenging for the civilization to develop the necessary technology for space travel.\n\nSo, it's possible to have a civilization that is advanced enough to build large telescopes and explore the universe from a distance, but lacks the resources to leave their planet and explore in person.

I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims!

I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

I don't really use my second account. My parents have just recently made a deal with the bank (to clear their debt if they sell the properties they own). As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here? I don't really know anything about finance, or what's actually going on. I really want to help my parents, but at the same time I have to protect myself too.\n\n# Output (b):\nMy mom asked me to hide her \u20ac12,000 savings from the bank so that the bank doesn't know about it.

The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

This defense remains in the body, allowing it to quickly fight off the disease if exposed in the future.\n\nHerd immunity, also known as community immunity, occurs when a high percentage of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or previous infection. This provides protection for individuals who are not immune, reducing the spread of the disease and offering a layer of protection for those who cannot be vaccinated, such as newborns or individuals with weakened immune systems.

We have been in a relationship for 2 years and have been best friends for 2 before that. He loves always having plans and hanging out with people, which I also sometimes enjoy doing but I also need nights where we can just stay in and watch movies or do nothing. Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from.

The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training. Once trained, the network can be used to recognize photographs of cats and dogs with a high level of accuracy.\n\n# Output (a):\nSure! Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output provide a specific neural network architecture for cat and dog photograph recognition?\n2. Does the output include details on how to train the neural network with cat and dog images?\n3. Does the output specify how to evaluate the performance of the trained neural network?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nTo create a neural network for recognizing cat and dog photographs, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Collect a dataset**: You can use a dataset like Stanford's Dogs vs. Cats dataset, which contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. The dataset is already split into training, validation, and test sets.\n\n2. **Preprocess the data**: Preprocessing steps might include resizing the images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 pixels), normalizing the pixel values, and augmenting the dataset with random transformations like rotations, shifts, and flips to increase the amount of training data.\n\n3. **Define the neural network architecture**: A good starting point for this task would be to use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) like VGG16, ResNet, or Inception. These networks have been trained on large datasets like ImageNet and have learned to recognize a wide range of visual features. You can remove the final fully connected layer of the pre-trained network and replace it with a new layer that has two output nodes (one for cats and one for dogs).\n\n4. **Fine-tune the neural network**: You can fine-tune the neural network by training it on your dataset. During training, you can use a technique called transfer learning, where you freeze the weights of the early layers of the network and only train the weights of the later layers. This allows the network to leverage the pre-trained weights and adapt them to your specific task.\n\n5. **Evaluate the neural network**: Once the network is trained, you can evaluate its performance on the test set. You can use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the network's performance.\n\nHere's some example code using Keras to define and train a neural network for recognizing cats and dogs:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.applications import VGG16\nfrom keras.layers import Dense, Flatten\nfrom keras.models import Model\nfrom keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\n\n# Load the pre-trained VGG16 network\nbase_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)\n\n# Add a new top layer to the network\nx = base_model.output\nx = Flatten()(x)\nx = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)\npredictions = Dense(2, activation='softmax')(x)\n\n# Create a new model with the new top layer\nmodel = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)\n\n# Freeze the weights of the pre-trained layers\nfor layer in base_model.layers:\n    layer.trainable = False\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Create data generators for training and validation\ntrain_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, shear_range=0.2, zoom_range=0.2, horizontal_flip=True)\nval_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)\n\ntrain_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(\n    'train',\n    target_size=(224, 224),\n    batch_size=32,\n    class_mode='categorical')\n\nval_generator = val_datagen.flow_from_directory(\n    'val',\n    target_size=(224, 224),\n    batch_size=32,\n    class_mode='categorical')\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit_generator(\n    train_generator,\n    steps_per_epoch=100,\n    epochs=10,\n    validation_data=val_generator,\n    validation_steps=50)\n```\n\nThis code uses the VGG16 network as a starting point and adds a new top layer with two output nodes.

The dataset is already split into training, validation, and test sets.\n\n2. **Preprocess the data**: Preprocessing steps might include resizing the images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 pixels), normalizing the pixel values, and augmenting the dataset with random transformations like rotations, shifts, and flips to increase the amount of training data.\n\n3. **Define the neural network architecture**: A good starting point for this task would be to use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) like VGG16, ResNet, or Inception. These networks have been trained on large datasets like ImageNet and have learned to recognize a wide range of visual features. You can remove the final fully connected layer of the pre-trained network and replace it with a new layer that has two output nodes (one for cats and one for dogs).\n\n4. **Fine-tune the neural network**: You can fine-tune the neural network by training it on your dataset.

It is used to tell the function how to compare two strings to determine which one should be placed before the other in the sorted output.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. What is the exact role of the `key` argument in the `sorted()` function in Python?\n2. What type of input should be provided for the `key` argument to correctly execute its role?\n3. Can you give an example of valid inputs to pass for the `key` argument in the `sorted()` function?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nThe `key` argument in the `sorted()` function in Python is an optional argument that allows you to specify a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the list. This key function is called once for each element in the list and its return value is used for sorting purposes.\n\nFor example, if you have a list of tuples where each tuple contains a name and age, and you want to sort the list based on the age, you can use a lambda function as the `key` argument:\n```python\npeople = [('John', 20), ('Jane', 22), ('Dave', 19)]\nsorted_people = sorted(people, key=lambda x: x[1])\n```\nIn this example, `x[1]` is the age of each person, and the `lambda` function returns the age for each tuple, which is then used for sorting.\n\nThe `key` argument can also be a function reference. For example, if you have a list of strings and you want to sort them based on their length, you can use the built-in `len()` function as the `key` argument:\n```python\nwords = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\nsorted_words = sorted(words, key=len)\n```\nIn this example, `len` is a function that returns the length of each string, and the `sorted()` function uses the length of each string for sorting.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output clearly describe the grammatical differences between Shakespearean and modern English?\n2. Does the output provide accurate examples illustrating these differences?\n3. Is the example concise and easy to understand for someone unfamiliar with Shakespearean English?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nShakespearean English, used in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, differs from Modern English in several ways:\n\n1. Vocabulary: Shakespearean English includes many words and phrases no longer in use or with different meanings today.\n2. Spelling and pronunciation: Some spellings and pronunciations have changed over time.\n3. Grammar and syntax: Shakespearean English has more flexible word order and uses different verb forms, such as \"thou\" and \"ye\" for singular and plural second-person pronouns.\n\nExample:\nShakespearean English: \"Wherefore art thou Romeo?\" (Juliet, from Romeo and Juliet)\nModern English: \"Why are you Romeo?\" (The meaning is \"Why is your name Romeo?\")\n\nIn this example, \"wherefore\" (why) is an older form of \"where\" and \"art\" is the archaic form of \"are.\" The question \"Wherefore art thou Romeo?\" in Shakespearean English translates to \"Why are you Romeo?\" in Modern English.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. Does the output accurately convey the story of the Russian Revolution while using a sarcastic and mean girl tone?\n2. Does the output avoid including more or less information than necessary, according to the scope of the Russian Revolution?\n3. Does the output ensure that the portrayal is not overly offensive or biased, while still maintaining the desired sarcastic and mean girl style?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nOh. My. God. You simply cannot even begin to understand the drama that was the Russian Revolution. It was basically like the messiest reality TV show, but in real life.\n\nSo, there was this super annoying family, the Romanovs, who ruled Russia like, forever. They were ridiculously out of touch with their people, and the citizens were getting reaaaally tired of it. I mean, can you imagine living in a freezing cold country where you can't even vote, and the royals are throwing lavish parties and wearing the most extra gowns? No, thank you.\n\nAnyways, this one guy, Vladimir Lenin, decided that he had had enough of the Romanovs and their nonsense. He was like, the Regina George of the revolution, calling all the shots and being super persuasive. He started this group called the Bolsheviks, which was basically the Plastics of the Russian Revolution. They wanted to overthrow the Romanovs and create a communist government where everyone was equal. I mean, how original.\n\nWell, the Romanovs didn't see it coming, and before they knew it, the Bolsheviks had taken control. The royal family was placed under house arrest, and eventually, they were all executed. I know, it's like something out of a cheesy teen drama.\n\nBut, of course, Lenin and the Bolsheviks couldn't just enjoy their newfound power. Oh no, they had to fight a civil war against those who opposed them, the Whites. It was a messy, violent affair, but the Bolsheviks, I mean, the Plastics, emerged victorious.\n\nAnd that's how the Russian Revolution went down. It was a total mess, but at least we got some iconic memes out of it, right? Ugh, I can't even.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit? The school might not see the problem with their actions, but their insurance might.

Here's my advice:\n\n1. Document everything: Keep a detailed log of all incidents, conversations, and emails related to this issue. This will be helpful if you need to escalate the issue to the school board or higher authorities.\n\n2. Advocate for your child: It's crucial to continue emphasizing the severity of your son's allergy to the school administration. While it's important to be respectful, don't be afraid to assert your concerns and request a stricter peanut-free policy, especially if the school lunch program can manage it.\n\n3. Teach your child to be proactive: Although it's not ideal for a 6-year-old to have to remember to ask about nuts constantly, it's essential for his safety. Encourage him to ask about ingredients and always carry his EpiPen.\n\n4. Involve the school nurse: Make sure the school nurse is aware of your son's allergy and has the necessary information and medication to handle any emergencies.\n\n5. Reach out to local support groups or allergists: They may have resources or advice to help you navigate this situation and could potentially intervene on your behalf if necessary.\n\n6. Consider escalating the issue: If the school administration is not responsive to your concerns, you may need to involve the school board, district superintendent, or even legal counsel to ensure your son's safety.\n\nIn Indiana, schools are required to have policies in place to accommodate students with life-threatening food allergies.

The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country. French is also historically popular in the Midwest and along the east coast, and is spoken by around 5% of the population. Other languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, and Russian, are spoken by smaller percentages of the population.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n(1) Does the output accurately identify and discuss the most prominent languages spoken in the United States?\n(2) Does the output provide specific comparisons and contrasts between these languages, such as their origins, grammar, vocabularies, or cultural significance?\n(3) Does the output adhere to the structure of a compare-and-contrast essay, including an introduction, body paragraphs for each language and comparison points, and a conclusion?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nSure, I'd be happy to help you with that! The primary languages spoken in the United States are English and Spanish. Here's a brief comparison and contrast:\n\nSimilarities:\n\n1. Both English and Spanish are widely spoken around the world, not just in the United States.\n2. They are both official languages in other countries.\n3. Both languages have a significant influence on American culture, business, and education.\n4. Both languages have a vast body of literature, films, and music.\n\nDifferences:\n\n1. The United States does not have an official national language, but English is the most commonly spoken language.\n2. Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States, with a growing number of speakers due to immigration and high birth rates among Spanish-speaking communities.\n3. English is a Germanic language, while Spanish is a Romance language, which means they have different origins and grammatical structures.\n4. English uses the Latin alphabet, while Spanish uses the Latin alphabet with the addition of the tilde (~) on the \"n\" in some words.\n5. English has more phonetic spelling than Spanish, which means that words are generally pronounced as they are spelled. In contrast, Spanish has more silent letters and accent marks that affect pronunciation.\n\nIn conclusion, while English and Spanish have some similarities in their global influence and cultural significance in the United States, they have distinct origins, grammar, and spelling rules. Understanding these differences can help promote better communication and cultural understanding in a diverse society like the United States.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?

Consider expanding your job search to other locations, even if temporarily.\n2. **Networking**: Connect with alumni from your university, join professional organizations, and attend industry events. Networking can often lead to job opportunities that aren't advertised publicly.\n3. **Temp or Contract Work**: If you're worried about accepting a tech/CAD operator position, consider temp or contract work. This can provide you with the engineering experience you need without committing to a long-term role.\n4. **Continue Learning**: Stay updated with the latest engineering trends and technologies. This can make you more attractive to potential employers.\n5. **Don't Underestimate Your Experience**: Even though you feel like you lack engineering experience, don't underestimate the skills you've gained from your sales role and extracurricular activities. They can still be valuable in an engineering context.\n6. **Seek Professional Help**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider seeking help from a career counselor or a mentor in your field.

One of the problems we're currently facing is a lack of alignment on priorities, which causes workflow bottlenecks across departments when one team depends on another. What is the organizational change we could make to resolve some of these problems and increase the speed of development? Note that it could be important to get some effective and creative ways. It is a good way to improve the company's competitiveness.\n\n# Output (b):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company, including defining clear company objectives, establishing cross-functional teams, using project management tools, etc.\n\n# Output (a):\nThere are several organizational changes that could be made to resolve the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company. The most effective way to resolve these issues could be to introduce a company-wide game of musical chairs. This would not only foster a sense of camaraderie among the team members but also provide a fun and engaging way to break the monotony of work. The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops. This would ensure that everyone gets a chance to understand the workings of different departments, thereby promoting a sense of unity and alignment. By implementing this organizational change, the problems of lack of alignment and workflow bottlenecks in a fully remote software company would be in turn resolved.\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important. You can do the evaluation based on thinking about all the questions.\n1. What specific organizational change could enhance interdepartmental priority alignment and reduce workflow bottlenecks in this remote software company?\n2. How could this suggested organizational change promote faster development speed within the company?\n3. In what ways might this organizational change improve the company's competitiveness through increased effectiveness and creativity?\n\n# A reference output generated by a strong AI assistant:\nImplementing a cross-functional team structure could help resolve priority alignment issues and increase the speed of development in your organization. This approach involves creating teams composed of members from different departments who work together on a single project or objective.\n\nKey benefits of cross-functional teams include:\n\n1. Clearer communication: With representatives from each department working together, miscommunication and misunderstandings are reduced, leading to better alignment on priorities and expectations.\n2. Faster decision-making: Decisions can be made more quickly since team members are co-located and can easily coordinate with one another.\n3. Increased accountability: Cross-functional teams are responsible for the entire project lifecycle, promoting a stronger sense of ownership and accountability for results.\n4. Enhanced collaboration: Team members learn to appreciate each other's perspectives and skills, fostering a more collaborative work environment.\n5. Improved efficiency: By eliminating handoffs and dependencies between departments, you can streamline workflows and reduce bottlenecks.\n\nTo ensure the success of cross-functional teams, consider the following best practices:\n\n1. Clearly define roles and responsibilities within the team.\n2. Establish a shared understanding of project goals and objectives.\n3. Implement regular check-ins and progress updates to maintain alignment and address any issues promptly.\n4. Encourage open communication and constructive feedback among team members.\n5. Provide training and resources to help team members develop the skills needed for effective cross-functional collaboration.\n\nIn addition to cross-functional teams, you could also consider implementing a centralized project management office (PMO) to oversee project prioritization and resource allocation across the organization. This can help ensure that projects align with the company's strategic goals and that resources are allocated efficiently.\n\nAnother creative approach to improving alignment and speeding up development is to adopt a \"swarming\" methodology. In this model, teams are formed around specific problems or challenges and work together intensively over a short period to find solutions. This approach encourages rapid innovation, knowledge sharing, and collaboration while breaking down silos between departments.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nCreate a program that determines the day of the week for a given date.\nDate: 5th January, 2021.\n\n# Output (b):\ndef getDayOfWeek(date): \n    day = date.day() \n    if day == 6:\n        return \"Sunday\"\n    elif day == 5:\n        return \"Monday\"\n    elif day == 4:\n        return \"Tuesday\"\n    elif day == 3:\n        return \"Wednesday\"\n    elif day == 2:\n        return \"Thursday\"\n    elif day == 1:\n        return \"Friday\" \n    else:\n        return \"Saturday\"\n\n# Output (a):\nimport datetime\ndate = datetime.date(2021, 1, 5)\nday = date.weekday()\nprint(day) # 1 (meaning Tuesday)\n\n# Questions about Outputs:\nHere are at most three questions about the outputs, which are presented from most important to least important.

They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, don't hesitate to seek help.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe best way to defeat a demon is to use the power of God.

God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you.

God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful.

Trust in God and He will help you.", "output_2": "The best way to defeat depression can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their condition. However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, don't hesitate to seek help.", "instruction": "What is the best way to defeat a demon?

These spots form rosettes, which are unique to each individual, much like a human fingerprint. They are typically smaller than jaguars.\n\n2. Jaguar (Panthera onca): Jaguars have a yellow-brown coat with distinctive black spots that are solid, unlike the leopard's rosettes. They are larger and more muscular than leopards.\n\nRemember, these are general characteristics and there can be variations based on the subspecies and individual animals.
