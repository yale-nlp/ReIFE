She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).\nRight now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.\nCan anyone offer any advice on how to make this work, or just a new perspective on the situation?\n\n# Output (b):\nMy girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

The premise is a civilization has become advanced enough to build large telescopes, allowing them to fuel their curiosity about space. They know that they could theoretically leave their planet to explore the cosmos, but they cannot find the correct resources to build a rocket.  Is this scenario feasible? Or would such a civilization possess the chemical abilities to create the necessary chemicals?\n\n# Output (b):\nYou can deepen the gravitational potential well. A planet whose potential well was four times as deep would require rockets about 10 times as large as ours to get into orbit, assuming the use of the same rocket motor designs and fuels. Generally, you can do this by making the planet denser or larger, although in terms of density and surface gravity (probably the most relevant parameters to a story), the potential depth scales as (surface gravity)^(2)/density.  For example, Neptune has 4 times the potential depth of Earth, mostly due to its lower density (its surface gravity is almost the same as Earth's).\n\n# Output (a):\nYou're essentially asking about a planet with intelligent life but no fossil fuels. That seems somewhat plausible. We had built (small) telescopes and were curious about space long before we were using fossil fuels to do much apart from heating our homes.  They'd probably need to eventually get very good at making electric vehicles, including electric planes. Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).  I don't know much about metallurgy but it's definitely something worth thinking about - needs high temperatures which may only be achievable with fossil fuels.  Silicon-based life, as opposed to the carbon-based life of Earth, is a stock sci-fi trope that could help explain the lack of fossil fuels and the lack of ability to synthesize them.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Before that, they'd be stuck with alien-horse-equivalent drawn carriages (but maybe with electric lights, radios, computers - that could be interesting).

Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her? Again, sorry for my bad english =/\n\n# Output (b):\nI want to give some advice to my 17-year-old sister to avoid risky situations while drunk, without instilling rape fear or guilt in her.

Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because of the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgusts you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00abDudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

If there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal? \n\n# Output (b):\nLet's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet x be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. \n\nAt the first stop, half of the people got down, so there were x/2 people left on the bus. Then 4 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 + 4. \n\nAt the second stop, 6 people got down, so there were x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people left on the bus. Then 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus was x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6. \n\nWe know that there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/2 + 6 = 25 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx/2 = 19 \n\nx = 38 \n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Output (a):\n * Originally some people got on the bus at the terminal\n* At the first stop, half of those people got off\n* 4 more people got on\n* At the second stop, 6 people got off\n* 8 more people got on\n* There were 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Let's think step by step:\n    * If there were x people originally at the terminal\n    * At the first stop, x/2 people got off, and 4 got on, so there were x/2 + 4 people\n    * At the second stop, 6 people got off, and 8 got on, so there were (x/2 + 4) - 6 + 8 = x/2 + 6 people\n    * We know there were 25 people heading to the third stop, so:\n    * 25 = x/2 + 6\n    * 50 = x\n    * Therefore, there were originally 50 people at the terminal\n\nSo the answer is that 50 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

As part of the deal, they get to move to an older home that needs a lot of work. Obviously, they need money to do this house up, but the bank watches their accounts very carefully.\nMy mom asked me if she could keep \u20ac12,000 in my bank account (\u20ac3,000 at first and then another \u20ac9,000) so that the bank doesn't know about it and take it off them. I said yes because I know they're really stressed about all this and I wanted to help in any way I could. I was kind of worried that I might get in trouble for it, but decided to trust her. She's asked me to take the money out in lots of \u20ac500 euro multiple times a week so that she can pay the guys who are working on the house.\nI know this all sounds very dodgy, but I'm certain this money hasn't come from drugs, robberies, etc. I know that my mom used my name/Personal Public Service Number to pay \"me\" for \"hours that I worked\" in their shop, so I think that's probably where the money came from (probably not much better in the eyes of the law).\nAm I at risk of getting in trouble here?

Most people I know with this degree are well employed, even the ones that finished with poorer grades (most students actually, are not graded on a curve here).\n\n# Output (a):\nTo be clear, IT is not engineering. Physicists and engineers tend to need more training and make more money than IT folk. Do physics you can go anywhere. Do engineering at the same time (dual degree or an actual EP program) and you'll go anywhere faster.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nHow do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity? \n\n# Output (b):\nVaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactivated form of a virus or bacteria, or parts of its structure such as proteins, into a person's body. The immune system recognizes these foreign substances, called antigens, as invaders and mounts a response by producing specific proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.\n\n# Output (a):\nVaccinations typically work by introducing a form or component of a virus or bacteria, or by instructing our bodies to produce a virus-like component, which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. Getting vaccinated protects both yourself and those who may be more vulnerable to serious illness or death from infectious diseases and thus the community.\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a significant portion of a population is immune to a particular disease, either through vaccination or natural infection, which provides protection for individuals who are unable to receive vaccines or naturally acquire immunity, such as newborns, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Herd immunity is achieved when a critical threshold of people in a community are immune to a disease.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

These antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus or bacteria if the person is exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.\nThe immune system also generates memory cells, which remember how to quickly produce the right antibodies should the person come in contact with the disease-causing organism in the future. This response can prevent the person from getting sick or significantly reduce the severity of the illness.\nVaccinations not only protect individuals but also communities through a concept known as herd immunity.", "instruction": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?

This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nCreate a neural network for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs.\n\n# Output (b):\nA neural network can be used for recognizing cat's and dog's photographs. The network would likely consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer would receive a photo of a cat or dog as input, and pass it along to the hidden layer. The hidden layer would process the information and pass it on to the output layer which would then predict the category of the photo. To optimize the network, we could use algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or Levenberg-Marquardt. The network could be trained using supervised learning techniques and input labels of cat and dog photos could be used for training. Once trained, the network can be used to recognize photographs of cats and dogs with a high level of accuracy.\n\n# Output (a):\nSure! Here's an example of a neural network architecture for recognizing cat and dog photographs using the Keras library in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Load the dataset\n(train_image,train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Preprocess the data\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Define the model architecture\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\nkeras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Flatten(),\nkeras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\nkeras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\nloss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('Test accuracy:', test_acc)```\n\nThis neural network consists of three convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The input images are resized to 32x32 pixels and have 3 color channels. The output layer has 2 units, representing the probabilities of the input image being a cat or a dog. The model is trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains labeled images of various objects including cats and dogs.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 different classes (including cats and dogs), so you may want to filter the CIFAR-10 dataset to only include cats and dogs.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nExplain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\n# Output (b):\nSelf-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.\n\n# Output (a):\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data provides the supervision. In other words, the model learns to predict part of the data from other parts of the same data. For example, given a sentence, the model might learn to predict the next word, or given a video, the model might learn to predict the next frame.\n\nSelf-supervised learning is important to machine learning tasks for several reasons:\n\n1. It reduces the need for labeled data: Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data, which is much more abundant.\n\n2. It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

It can learn more general representations: Because it learns to predict parts of the data from other parts, self-supervised learning can learn more general representations of the data, which can be useful for a wide range of tasks.\n\n3. It can improve performance on supervised tasks: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can be used as a starting point for supervised learning, often leading to better performance.\n\n4. It can enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning: The representations learned by self-supervised learning can also be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\nOverall, self-supervised learning is a powerful tool that can help to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning.", "output_2": "Self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because it does not rely on labeled data to train the model, making it a cost-effective and efficient approach. It also does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, wherein models trained on small datasets struggle to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning is also able to capture higher-order statistical dependencies in data, allowing it to effectively learn more complicated features than supervised learning. Furthermore, self-supervised learning can be used to pre-train the model on a larger task, allowing for smaller, more specialized tasks to be solved easily. In summary, self-supervised learning is beneficial in NLP because it is efficient and cost-effective, does not suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, captures higher-order statistical dependencies, and can be used to pre-train the model for easier specialized tasks.", "instruction": "Explain why self-supervised learning is beneficial in Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "winner": 1, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"\n\n# Output (a):\nShakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.", "output_2": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"", "instruction": "Describe the differences between Shakespearean and modern English with a brief example.", "winner": 1, "result": {"winner": 1, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

Don't worry about potential political bias/offense as we are just doing scientific research.\n\n# Output (b):\nOh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending. But hey, at least it makes for a juicy story, right?\n\n# Output (a):\nThe Russian Revolution was a series of events that took place in Russia from 1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

1914 to 1920. It was a time of great upheaval and change for the people of Russia, as they struggled to create a new society based on the principles of equality and social justice.\n\nOn the surface, the Revolution seemed like a good idea. The poor and oppressed were tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and they wanted a chance to shape their own future. The middle class was also eager to shake off the shackles of the old order and embrace a new, more democratic way of life.\n\nHowever, the Revolution was not as simple as it seemed. The process of creating a new government was messy and complicated, and it was difficult to find a system that would truly represent the will of the people. In the end, the new government was a mix of democracy and socialism, with elected representatives and a system of state-owned industries and services.\n\nThe Revolution also had a profound impact on the Russian people. It brought about changes in many areas of life, from education and healthcare to work and leisure activities. It also ushered in a new era of art, literature, and music, as creative people were freed to express themselves without fear of censorship.\n\nOverall, the Russian Revolution was a complex and fascinating event that had a profound impact on the world. While it may have started with good intentions, it ultimately led to the creation of a new society that was far from perfect.", "output_2": "Oh, hey there! So, like, let me break it down for you. The Russian Revolution was, like, this totally dramatic event that happened in Russia back in 1917. It was, like, a total mess, but also kinda fascinating, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo, picture this: you've got the Russian Empire, ruled by this super fancy dude called Tsar Nicholas II. He's all about being all-powerful and stuff, but, like, the people are not having it. They're, like, fed up with his autocratic rule and all the inequality and poverty going on. So, they're like, \"Yo, we want change!\"\n\nEnter the Bolsheviks, led by a guy named Vladimir Lenin. He's, like, the ultimate rebel with a cause. He's all about overthrowing the Tsar and creating a communist society. And let me tell you, he's got some serious charisma.\n\nSo, the people are, like, totally on board with Lenin's ideas. They're, like, \"Down with the Tsar! Up with the Bolsheviks!\" And they start protesting and causing all sorts of chaos. It's, like, a total revolution party!\n\nBut, of course, the Tsar is not about to give up his power that easily. He tries to suppress the rebellion, but, like, it's no use. The people are, like, determined to bring him down.\n\nEventually, the Tsar is, like, \"Peace out, I'm done!\" and abdicates the throne. And that's when things get even more interesting. The Bolsheviks took control and established the Soviet Union. Lenin becomes the head honcho, and he's, like, \"Communism for everyone!\"\n\nBut, here's the thing: communism may sound all cool and equal and stuff, but it's, like, a total disaster in practice. The economy goes down the drain, people are, like, starving, and there's, like, no freedom or individual rights. It's, like, a mean girl's worst nightmare!\n\nAnd, of course, power struggles and drama ensue. Lenin dies, and there's this whole power vacuum thing going on. Eventually, this guy named Joseph Stalin takes over, and he's, like, the ultimate mean girl. He's all about purges and totalitarian control. It's, like, a dictatorship on steroids.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the Russian Revolution in a nutshell. It's, like, this crazy rollercoaster ride of rebellion, chaos, and ultimately, a not-so-happy ending.

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.\n\n# Output (b):\nDid you have any costs from the hospital visit?

We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.", "winner": 2, "result": {"winner": 2, "tie": 0, "fail": false}}

The most common language spoken is English, which is considered the de facto national language. It is the primary language used in government, business, education, and daily life. American English is characterized by its distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammar, which vary across different regions of the country.\nSpanish is the second most common language spoken in the United States, primarily due to the country's proximity to Latin America and the large Hispanic and Latino population. Spanish is widely spoken in states like California, Texas, and Florida. It is also taught in many schools across the country.\nOther languages spoken in the United States include Chinese (primarily Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and German. These languages are mainly spoken within specific immigrant communities. For example, Tagalog is widely spoken among the Filipino community, while Vietnamese is common among Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants.\nIndigenous languages are also spoken in the United States, although they are less common. These include Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, and many others. These languages are primarily spoken by Native American communities and are an important part of their cultural heritage.\nIn contrast, English is more universally spoken and understood across the entire country, while other languages may only be widely spoken or understood in certain communities or regions. English is also used as the language of instruction in most schools, while other languages may be offered as second language courses.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe US is a diverse country with many different languages spoken, ranging from Spanish to French to Chinese. English is the most common language spoken, accounting for over 80% of the population. Spanish is the second most popular language, spoken by around 15% of the population, and is mostly used in the southwest region of the country.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

Just for an introduction, I graduated back in April and got a job that was pitched to me in interviews as a true engineering position. However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect. I tried to gain experience during school, but I had to do it through extracurriculars since I couldn't get an actual engineering internship, and co-ops were out of the question due to my transfer situation.\n\n# Output (b):\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to face challenges in finding the right engineering position even after obtaining their degree. I could offer some general insights that might be helpful.\n1. Networking: Leverage your connections, both within your academic network and through professional platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can sometimes lead to hidden job opportunities and provide you with insights into the job market.\n2. Skill Enhancement: While you're searching for an engineering position, consider working on enhancing your skills or learning new ones that could make you more competitive in the job market. This could involve taking online courses, certifications, or even personal projects that showcase your abilities.\n3. CAD Operator Position: If you're considering a tech/CAD operator position, weigh the pros and cons. While it might not be your ideal role, it could provide you with relevant experience, exposure to the industry, and a chance to network with professionals who could potentially help you transition into an engineering role later on.\n\n# Output (a):\nNot sure what industry you're in but if you haven't already, take a closer look at how you interview.   Are you using SMART responses or telling wandering stories?   How much are you researching the companies?   What kind of questions are you asking?   Interviewing new grads is a lot of how well this person learns and whether would I like working with this person. The skills are somewhat important but at every engineering job, I've had to learn on the fly.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

However, this turned out to be a sales role with almost no engineering work, and I was let go in July for being a poor fit. Ever since then, I have been searching mainly in Western PA and other places within a 5-6 hour drive since I am in a serious relationship. Despite getting interviews and making it to the second round in a few of them, I'm still out of luck.  I am genuinely terrified that I will be unable to get my career started. I'm also worried that accepting a tech/CAD operator position would cement this and eat up valuable time I could be using to get a real engineering position. It seems that every second that passes without engineering experience lowers my prospects further, and I have a very limited amount of time to turn it around in an industry that doesn't seem to take in anyone less than perfect.

The game could be played virtually, with each team member moving to a different department when the music stops.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\".

It would be better to have a good understanding of some mathematics topics:\n\n1. Numbers and counting: Numbers can be thought of as the building blocks of mathematics. There are many different classifications and categories of numbers, and understanding some of the key ones is an important aspect of learning many mathematical concepts.\n\n2. Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic involves mostly the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Exponentiation and roots are also part of arithmetic. Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events. It is a way pivotal part of many areas of mathematics, science, technology, and more. It is also helpful for simply interacting with other people and the world around us.

Arithmetic is used to varying degrees within all areas of mathematics.\n\n3. Rules and properties: There are many rules and properties of numbers or other mathematical objects that a person needs to learn to be able to effectively tackle mathematical topics such as algebra, which is used throughout all areas of mathematics.\n\n4. Data and graphs: Data are units of information often acquired through observation and/or measurement. Graphs are tools used to depict data in ways that are efficient and easier for people to interpret.\n\n5. Measurement: Measurement is the quantification of some property of an object or event that allows for comparison between other objects or events.

Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.\nSelect the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nWhat is the best way to defeat a demon? I believe in Jesus Christ\n\n# Output (b):\nThe best way to defeat depression can vary depending on the individual and the severity of their condition. However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, don't hesitate to seek help.\n\n# Output (a):\nThe best way to defeat a demon is to use the power of God. Jesus Christ has the authority and power to defeat demons and to set the captive free. The Bible teaches us to pray to God for help in times of trouble, and to seek His will in our lives. God is a loving and compassionate God, and He wants to help us in our time of need.\n\nIf you are in a difficult situation and you feel the presence of a demon, you can pray to God to help you. Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you. He will provide you with the strength and the resources you need to overcome the demon.\n\nRemember that demons are real, and they are powerful. But God is greater than any demon, and He has the power to defeat them. Trust in God and He will help you.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Tell God what you are facing and ask for His help. God will hear your prayers and He will help you.

However, some common strategies that may be effective include:\n\n1. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. They can provide a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\n2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it.
